"49479","Piccini's nod to the '90s (the other wines are fairly traditional) is this internationally styled “mini Tuscan” that blends ripe plum fruit with the chocolate and vanilla flavors imparted by oak.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",49479
"102161","This wine is structured and firm, with some bitterness. Acidity and red-currant fruits bring out the freshness of the year while still needing time to develop. The wine is concentrated and tight at the end. It will take time to be ready, so don't drink before 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",102161
"61189","Even in a challenging year like the cool and rainy 2014 vintage, this dynamic firm has made a stunning sparkler thanks to rigorous grape selection. Refermented in the bottle, it offers aromas and flavors of white spring flowers, lemon-lime, green apple and peach. Vibrant acidity and a foaming mousse offset the linear palate while a mineral note backs up the finish.","White","Glera","Italy",61189
"43709","Made with ripe Nero d'Avola grapes, this inky red wine offers density, richness and milky aromas of chocolate, blueberry and creamy berry. There's a touch of bitter spice on the close and the wine tastes chewy and soft.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",43709
"62581","Aromas of white wild flower and chamomile float out of the glass along with a whiff of orchard fruit. The ripe round palate offers juicy Bartlett pear, golden apple and peach. A note of bitter almond wraps up the finish.","White","Garganega","Italy",62581
"105801","Holding 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, this wine offers brooding aromas of fresh herbs, cherry, mocha and vanilla. The palate displays pleasing density and weight to the cranberry and cherry flavors that are accented by bright, zippy acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",105801
"65382","Yering Station makes a regular Chardonnay and a Reserve Chardonnay as well; this is its entry-level Chard, and quite a good one. Bright pineapple notes and a hint of grilled fruit are clean and fresh if somewhat straightforward in this medium-bodied wine. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",65382
"50689","Aged for 18 months in 100% new Virginia oak, this hefty blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Tannat has a deep, bass-like nose that mixes scents of caramel, mocha and cinnamon with notes of potpourri, dark cherry and gravel. It feels fleshy and full on the palate, with chewy tannins, stunning acids and a bold, well-stated finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",50689
"17919","Fresh fruit and lively raspberry juice flavors are totally up to the minute. The attractive orange-pink color emphasizes the ripe character of the wine's fruitiness.","Rosé","Rosé","France",17919
"16549","Pietramora Riserva is a dark and masculine wine with aromas of blackberry, black cherry and plum backed by soft renderings of spice, rum cake and leather. The wine shows nice density that is filling without being heavy.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",16549
"77950","This is a very fine wine with considerable bottle age. From its orange-pink color to its mature toast and almond flavors, this complex wine is much more than the fruit that has merged with the secondary flavors. Light tannins and a crisp texture are balanced by the softness that comes from the relatively high dosage. The wine, beautifully mature, is ready to drink.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",77950
"49280","With very ripe pineapple and pear flavors, this Chard also has a taste like cheddar cheese-dusted buttered popcorn. Crisp acidity helps to provide balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",49280
"11732","Dry Riesling of this quality is capable of aging up to two decades, especially under screw cap. this one is medium bodied and dominated at the moment by ripe, citrusy fruit. It's more orange than lime, yet still shows great acidity and length. Drink 2020–2030.","White","Riesling","Australia",11732
"72550","Very tart, almost sour, this high-acid wine just might be a good match for fresh oysters, but on its own it is slightly bitter and barely ripe.","White","Pinot Gris","US",72550
"84438","This 100% Sangiovese opens with aromas that recall coffee, scorched earth and toasted oak. The fleeting palate offers espresso, mocha and a green note of powdered sage alongside astringent tannins. The fruit has mostly dried out.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",84438
"25733","One of the wines produced to celebrate the family's 500-year history, this is intensely herbal, with taut and highly textured minerality. It tastes of the chalk soil with its zesty flavor, bursting out of the glass. Drink this still young wine from 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",25733
"84717","The result of a joint project between Michel Rolland and Jair Agopian, this Bulgarian Bordeaux-style blend has primary aromas of ripe blackberry, dark cherry and black plum that give way to intriguing secondary notes of saddle leather, tobacco leaf and graphite. It exhibits nice weight on the midpalate with juicy flavors of cassis, black raspberry and cherry vanilla. The tannins are firm yet velvety and there is a surprising burst of bright fruit in the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Bulgaria",84717
"51795","With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future. A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",51795
"105073","Aromas of summer orchard fruit and citrus blossom lead the nose on this bright, direct white. The linear palate doles out yellow apple, tangerine zest and a hint of mineral alongside brisk acidity.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",105073
"81089","While the nose is on the simple side, with ultraripe—almost confected—cherry, cocoa powder, flowers and medicinal herbs, it's the palate that draws you in. Fresh acidity, particularly for the variety, and a good lick of tannins round out this sleek, well-structured wine. Drink now–2025.","Red","Grenache","Australia",81089
"78046","Pronounced like “Cyrano,” this blend of 63% Petite Sirah, 28% Pinot Noir and 9% Syrah successfully mingles these distinct varieties. Crushed mulberry, strawberry and black plum meet with thyme and mint-chocolate-chip aromas on the nose. The palate shows similar flavors, yet is more subtle than a typical Petite Sirah, with a plush mouthfeel.","Red","Red Blend","US",78046
"20414","Always pretty, always polished, St. Jean's '05 Cinq Cepages is a solid red wine that drinks well now and should develop with a few years in the cellar. It's dry and firm in tannins, with flavors of blackberries, cassis and new smoky oak, marked by a soft texture of finely ground tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",20414
"78849","Produced close to the sea at Bandol, this wine has a good proportion (20%) of Mourvèdre in the blend. That adds to the richness and brings out a fine aromatic floral character. Wild strawberries flavors give a rich ready-to-drink aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",78849
"53144","Cigar box, green olive, herbal notes and field scents define the bouquet on this single-vineyard Cabernet. With bright acidity, the palate displays raciness along with oak-driven flavors of chocolate, mint, vanilla and herbal berry fruits. A lasting finish is spicy, herbal and mildly green in flavor.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",53144
"104745","A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104745
"56117","This blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre delivers juicy, almost gulpable fruit, supported by a loose spine of soft tannins. Purple raspberry and black cherry flavors linger on the supple finish. Drink now–2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",56117
"76871","Concentrated black plum and violet notes mesh with potting soil, cola and a candied black-raspberry character on the nose of this bottling. The palate combines boysenberry with woody elderberry fruit as well as a warmer red cherry and red-plum core, edged by pine needles, juniper and tart pomegranate complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76871
"92359","A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",92359
"27191","Carbonic maceration is the fermentation technique employed in this wine. It brings out vibrant Bing-cherry flavors and with a hint of bread dough. There are interesting highlights of cured meats also. This is a good choice for drinking with roasted birds.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27191
"75556","Lovely aromas meld rose petals and raspberries, while flavors convey sweet cherries with a dash of chocolate. Light hints of leaf and stem add complexity to the midpalate, and a hint of bacon surprises and delights in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75556
"58703","A somewhat unusual expression of Viognier with notes of lime, lime leaf, and white peach that seem more reminiscent of a Sauvignon Blanc. It's full bodied and viscous, ending with a bitter note.","White","Viognier","US",58703
"57254","Youthfully fruity now, with sweet, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla oak and spices. Comes from the warm, southern part of Salinas Valley. Could develop, but it's a gamble.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",57254
"104289","Dry and silky in the mouth, it has cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. However, the wine is compromised by a mushroomy, vegetal unripeness. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104289
"45947","Hailing from Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine brings black currant, huckleberry and dark plum aromas that smell pure and sweet. The black fruit and smoke flavors display a mixture of concentration and restraint.","Red","Syrah","US",45947
"82190","The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",82190
"68841","Cola and soft red raspberry scents show on the nose of this blend of 58% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 17% Syrah. It's easy-drinking and simple, with red fruit, white pepper and asphalt hints. A great, light, quaffable red for a warm day.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",68841
"27392","With an aroma like prosciutto and melon, a soft texture, and attractive floral and ripe peach flavors, this is a fun and affordable wine to drink at lunch or before dinner.","White","Viognier","US",27392
"52272","Tastes like apricot pie filling, mixed with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, with the smoky pastry crust. Simple and direct.","White","Chardonnay","US",52272
"69713","A really rich Cabernet, jam-packed with blackberry, cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors that are slightly sweet, with a brown sugar taste. The sweetness comes from the caramelized oak, not residual sugar, but the wine does have a candied quality. A bit rustic now. Give it 5–6 years and try again.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",69713
"34946","A simple, everyday wine. Tastes grapey and jammy, with blackberries, cherries and raspberries that are distinctly sweet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",34946
"19724","This is a solid effort, with good varietal character and definition. Half was fermented in stainless, half in neutral barrel, and the wine was given extended (130 days) lees contact. The herbal, peppery tang of the grape is clearly there, with intriguing hints of slate laced through the finish. This would be dynamite with sushi.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",19724
"36748","Bennett Valley is a cooler section of Sonoma County, and maybe the cool vintage was just too much. This wine isn't quite ripe.It's bone dry, acidic and tannic, and the fruit is herbal.","Red","Syrah","US",36748
"93767","The Chéreau family has long been proponents of wood-aging for some Muscadets. Also, so it appears, of long aging. The toasty aromas and flavors that still dominate the wine give it a Chardonnay feel, replacing the crispness of melon with a round creamy flavor. There is spice, but also some oxidation.","White","Melon","France",93767
"31188","Always a fine value, Barnard Griffin's Merlot is a brightly fruit wine with tart red and purple berry flavors. Tannins are still a bit stiff, but proportionate and ripe enough, with hints of café mocha in the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",31188
"30534","If you get at this now you may still enjoy the wine's freshness. Aromas of apricot and apple are clear and unadulterated by oak. The flavors of lemon, apple, pineapple and green papaya are zesty, while lasting acidity on the finish leaves a cleansing, wet impression.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",30534
"56513","This delicious Zin has almost everything one could ask for. It offers aromas of spicy oak and enticing ripe fruit. Flavors of black cherry and blackberry layer over subtle baking spices and smoke, while a great texture combines fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. A velvety viscosity helps flavors linger on the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",56513
"27874","This is a tight and racy take on a rarely planted grape for the region. with scratched lemon peel and lime pith aromas, plus a brie cheese-rind character. It's lively on the palate, with grapefruit peels, white flowers, lime juice and a touch of ripe apple flesh. Expect longevity.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",27874
"80154","Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",80154
"28918","The Estates Reserve is a barrel selection combining chosen lots from the three estate vineyards. Despite this vintage's reputation for offering ripe, forward, accessible flavors, this wine remains stubbornly closed. It's entirely possible that it has just hit a bit of a dumb phase, which is not uncommon for recently-bottled Pinot Noir. Ripe full-bodied flavors of strawberry preserves peek through, with moderating acids and no herbal notes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28918
"91194","The aromas are a bit too prickly and pickled to call the nose clean, and thus the wine never really achieves solid footing. The raspberry and strawberry fruit is there, but it's marred by sharp, pickled accents, which ultimately don't work in its favor. The feel is nice, as the acidity and tannins are proper. But with too much funk to the nose and palate, it misses the upper echelon.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",91194
"81230","Fruity and crisp, this bright wine offers flavors of lemon and fresh apple juice. A tangy lemon-zest texture gives great acidity and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",81230
"25502","This is a pristine and elegant Bolgheri Superiore with a particularly focused aromatic profile. The blend is 60-20-20 Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. A green, herbal note comes through. You'll also recognize elements of caper, green olive, mineral, tobacco and exotic fruit. It shows thick fruit and dense concentration as well.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",25502
"95274","Aromas of mocha, tire rubber, herbs and blue fruit aren't entirely in sync. They lead to a palate with soft, fleshy fruit flavors and a light structure trying to hold it all together.","Red","Merlot","US",95274
"74529","Dark berry aromas, chocolate and grit define the nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo. The palate feels ripe and fresh, but the tannins are hard and grabby. Black plum flavors are bold and offer notes of spice, herbs and earthiness. This is composed on the finish despite a reprise of hard smacking tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",74529
"90077","Earns points for sheer size, a powerhouse of concentrated, intense blackberry and cassis flavors, liberally coated with oak. The tannins are big, thick and hard, and at this point, the wine is not showing much drinkability. Ageability might be compromised by some superripe, raisiny fruit notes. Tasted twice.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90077
"50276","The nose signals crunchy, crisp red apple, which also follows through on the sprightly, wonderfully foamy and fresh palate of exquisitely small bubbles. This is light but full-fruited, brimming with all the crunch of Red Delicious and Braeburn apples supported by just a little shortbread richness from the yeast. There is concentration and poise, utter freshness and quite a bit of length.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Austria",50276
"88882","Spine-tingling lime and lemon notes dominate this light-footed dry Riesling. Refreshingly mineral on the palate, it finishes brisk and clean.","White","Riesling","Germany",88882
"100197","Crisp, round and spicy, this has dominating flavors of apples and pears. A green plum flavor and pure acidity complement the finish.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",100197
"20355","A touch of honeysuckle meets ripe, juicy pear on the nose. The palate adds a touch of residual sweetness to boost the fruit flavors, as well as a pithy, slightly bitter texture to provide a frame. Everything is shot through with bright, lively lemon freshness, which is exactly what makes the wine so moreish in its medium-sweet way.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",20355
"59097","Ripe and round, this soft, juicy wine shows just a hint of a more serious tannic structure. It has plenty of acidity to go with its warm, red cherry flavors. Drink now, or better from 2015.","Red","Gamay","France",59097
"95751","Fans of great big wines will like it, but this Petite Sirah is unbalanced, with heat from high alcohol compounding the acidity, making the mouhtfeel prickly. The berry flavors are overripe, running into raisins and chocolate.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",95751
"25332","Rich and fruity in Cabernet character, with blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors subtlely tinged with oak. With soft tannins and a dry finish, it's a fine expression of Cabernet for drinking now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25332
"89549","Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",89549
"100151","Peach blossoms, fresh apricot, light jasmine and a warm white peach cream character show on the nose of this bottling. There is a nice sizzle of acidity right away on the palate, and a pithy, cement-like grip, as well as full flavors of apple and peach blossoms that are rich and yet not overpowering.","White","Chardonnay","US",100151
"57305","Mild citrus aromas come with green notes. This is a medium-level Sauvignon Blanc without a lot of acidic snap. Melon and grapefruit flavors are friendly, simple and chunky, while overall this shows characterisitcs of a warm, bland vintage.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",57305
"86684","This is a big, bold wine with a wild, slightly earthy and herbal character in the otherwise ripe blackberry and spicy pepper aromas and flavors. The texture is quite thick with tannins, and the body is full. It comes from the windy and cool Jameson Canyon corner of Napa Valley.","Red","Syrah","US",86684
"21702","There's a diluted nature to this wine, from a selection of varietal clones. Dry, it holds back on flavor, delivering a light texture and soft red-fruit flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21702
"104811","This is a wonderful wine that's dryish and vital in acidity, with savory Meyer lemon, grapefruit, lemongrass, apricot and vanilla flavors. A touch of oak brings a buttered toast richness. Only 260 cases were produced.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",104811
"68634","With a nose of strong plum and baked raspberry, Miro's blend of 67% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 8% Syrah is strong in Grenache's perfumed rose petal and bright fruit flavor, fairly priced and sure to be enjoyed with food.","Red","G-S-M","US",68634
"12459","This wine features the signature, woodsy, savory aromas of Phillips Hill. It has a lighter, slightly tawny color compared with most of its peers from Anderson Valley. Flavors combine spice and fruit with meaty, mushroomy notes, giving character and personality to a delicious wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12459
"70464","Ultraripe black fruits—berries and cherries, along with raisins—reflect the high alcohol. Even so, the wine carries an impression of almost sugary sweetness, as if still not fermented completely dry. Spice cake and plum pudding, with heat on the finish, mark this as extreme by previous Fielding Hills standards. Drink soon.","Red","Syrah","US",70464
"76681","Tamaya seems to have turned the corner with its 2008 Cabs (the reserva is also very good). This wine is condensed and concentrated, with blackberry jam and other sweet berry aromas. The palate is pure and tastes of cassis and black fruit, while the finish has cola notes and a slight tannic bite. Generous for the price. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",76681
"89323","Made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Alicante Bouschet and 5% Merlot, this savory red delivers aromas and flavors of underbrush, black cherry, licorice and a hint of Mediterranean herb. It's easy drinking and balanced with lithe tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",89323
"102395","Here's a subdued and understated Dolcetto that has been executed in a lighter, fruit-forward style with informal appeal and sour tannins on the close. You'll recognize aromas of dark fruit, berries and fresh spice.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",102395
"93097","There's a firm, clean minerality to this Chardonnay, like a lick of cold granite, that shines through the citrus and tropical fruit flavors. A touch of oak brings buttered toast. It's an elegant, food-friendly wine at a price that won't break the bank.","White","Chardonnay","US",93097
"56075","Not quite up there with the wonderful 2003, probably due to the hot vintage, which made it a little soft and overripe, but it's a very good wine. Shows black currant, mu shu plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, clove and pepper flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. At its best now and for a year or two.","Red","Syrah","US",56075
"86217","A big and powerful wine with a vibrant, rich texture. Dense black plum and ripe berry fruits push through the firm tannins. The wine is smooth and perfumed with a big spicy aftertaste. Drink now, or keep for 2–3 years.","Red","Mourvèdre","France",86217
"76467","Gooseberry and feline aromas are true to the variety but a bit austere and sharp. The palate is plump like you'd expect from warm-climate SB, while flavors of nectarine, citrus and melon finish full, tangy and a bit heavy.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",76467
"79293","Here's a charming and fresh Barbera d'Asti with delicious cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors. It's simple but well made, and is all about easy enjoyment. Pair this with mushroom risotto or hearty pasta dishes.","Red","Barbera","Italy",79293
"101276","Cuvée V, MAN's homage to the wines of Vouvray, is an attractive and semisweet-style Chenin Blanc that offers rich aromas of peach, lightly baked apple and tropical fruit. A slight prickle from the bright acidity dances on the palate and keeps the wine from feeling too sweet or heavy. Drink now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",101276
"85449","Tastes overworked and sweetly heavy, with super-extracted pineapple jam, orange tapioca and butterscotch flavors. A heavy hand has been applied here.","White","Chardonnay","US",85449
"82469","This opens with subdued aromas of dark berry, cake spice, espresso and a whiff of pressed violet. On the straightforward palate, hints of white pepper and star anise add depth to dried morello cherry while solid tannins lend support.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",82469
"13247","Golden pear and citrus fruit shimmer in the glass. The palate is ripe and fresh, made taut by citrus but glowing with ripe juicy pear and red apple. There is a lovely textured midpalate that is reminiscent of chalk, shot through with freshness that underlines the ripe fruit of 2015 even more. This is tangy and refreshing, concentrated and dry with a lovely long and whistle-clean aftertaste.","White","Riesling","France",13247
"106275","Lots of delicious blackberry, cherry, cola, roasted meat and sandalwood flavors in this Syrah. While it has a certain fanciness, it's kind of simple, soft in structure and without a future. Drink it now, especially with lamb dishes, or try a vegetarian lasagna.","Red","Syrah","US",106275
"100252","Pineapple and grapefruit flavors are accented by hints of tomato leaf, meaning this conforms to the basic Marlborough profile that blends fruit with grassy, herbal notes. Pretty good, it just fades a bit quickly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",100252
"89651","This is overtly rustic, roasted, leathery and strange on the nose. A wide but wayward palate seems sluggish, while rubbery black-fruit and burnt-wood flavors finish with murky berry tones.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",89651
"68066","Ripe but not jammy fruit flavors and firm texture make this a stand-up wine, even if it weren't such a great value. It has classic dark berry and light herb aromas, deep, fruity flavors and a big but plush mouthfeel.","Red","Red Blend","US",68066
"89558","This Bordeaux-style blend—with an addition of Mourvèdre—is soft, simple and cloying, with vegetal flavors alongside the sweet raspberry jam note. High alcohol makes for a hot mouthfeel.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",89558
"68787","Aromas of exotic spice, wild berry, blue flower and French oak meld together on this luminous delicious red. The bright structured palate delivers succulent cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and vanilla alongside polished elegant tannins that give it an irresistibly smooth texture. Bright acidity lends balanced. Drink 2019–2033.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",68787
"73907","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Sangiovese brings bright aromas of cranberries, red currants and cherries. The palate packs a punch of dark-fruit flavors, showing some heat on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",73907
"26351","Sangiovese, Syrah and Merlot are blended to form a rich and supple red, with black cherry, chocolate, cinnamon and blackberry nuances. The mouthfeel is characterized by richness, softness and a touch of bright crispness.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",26351
"24979","Despite its low alcohol level, this is an attractively plump, medium-bodied wine, marked by a harmonious kaleidoscope of fruit. Passion fruit, nectarine and pink grapefruit all make appearances before vanishing a bit quickly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",24979
"1900","Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now.","Red","Syrah","US",1900
"80063","This is one of the best Pinots Riverbench has produced. It's a delight to drink, with a silky, gentle texture and crisp acidity to get your mouth watering. For all the lightness of mouthfeel, the flavors are serious, suggesting raspberries and cherries with earthy notes of mushrooms, cola and herb tea. It would not be surprising if this wine was still gaining traction in 2020, but you can decant it and drink it now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80063
"84746","Tasting similar to Chardonnay, this has a buttery, creamy texture that frames orange, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It gains extra points for delicacy and balance. The appellation is in San Benito County, about 25 miles inland from Monterey.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",84746
"70231","Somewhat unusual for the appellation, this wine doesn't include any Syrah; the blend is 80% Grenache and 20% Carignan. This medium- to full-bodied wine offers hints of Mexican chocolate, ripe black cherries and dried herbs backed by a smooth, silky, long finish. Drink now–2022.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",70231
"78856","American Brad Hickey has turned out a full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz that features a strong savory component. Hints of eucalyptus, roasted meat, espresso and plum all come together to finish long and velvety. Drink now through 2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",78856
"100370","This eight-year old wine, based on Touriga Nacional, is ripe, now mature with the tannins fully integrated into the rich black fruit. It is firm with a structure that gives concentration and perfumed acidity. The wine is still dark and dense although ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",100370
"44829","So upfront in spectacularly ripe raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, it's hard to keep from draining the bottle now. This shows the classic tannins of Stags Leap, soft and sweet but potent. Drink it now and enjoy for sheer opulence, but you might be missing out on something really special around 2016.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44829
"5606","Aromas of freshly-sawn wood set the scene on a wine that is full of new-wood toast and vanilla flavors. The fruit is also present, resulting in a wine that has balanced potential in maybe 4–5 years. A fine effort.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",5606
"37797","The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.","Red","Grenache","Spain",37797
"89283","Developed aromas of forest floor and mushrooms come as no surprise, given the deep brick color on this Alsace Pinot. The highly nuanced palate is complex and shot through with mineral notes. Cherry cola flavors dominate the long finish. An excellent foil for squab or other game birds.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",89283
"89149","Fully ripe aromas of blackberry, raisin, vanilla and wood grain set up a fleshy, bold palate that's tannic, but not tough or impermeable. Savory oak and ripe berry fruit flavors finish chewy and dense, with moderate complexity. Drink through 2025.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",89149
"68072","A pleasant, citrusy Chardonnay, but one that is well-oaked, with the resulting aromas and flavors of vanilla and buttered toast. Lemon and lime flavors veer into riper peach, and are wrapped in a creamy texture. Acidity is quite high and bursts on the palate with a mouthwatering zest.","White","Chardonnay","US",68072
"33606","A fruity, apple-driven wine, this has a creamy texture. It is soft, lightly spicy and with delicious acidity. The wine is fruity, fragrant and refreshing. Drink now, reveling in the fruit.","White","Chardonnay","France",33606
"26440","A concentrated wine, just beginning to open up, with a serious, maybe austere mineral element, as well as vibrant kiwi and citrus flavors. It is softened by aging in older wood, giving some roundness to finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",26440
"9824","This vineyard-designate Brunello opens with ripe tones of prune, thick blackberry fruit and lingering but subdued Indian spice. This is not an overblown or overly intense wine. Instead, the focus is on elegance and longevity.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",9824
"74682","With jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and smoky oak, this easy-drinking Petite Sirah shows the peppery notes and thick tannins of the variety. Drink now.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",74682
"57203","The aromas bring generous notes of botrytis, chamomile, flowers, peach, ale and green apple. It drinks off dry, with well-balanced stone fruit and floral flavors that linger.","White","Riesling","US",57203
"14912","A disappointment after the rich 2005. They should have declassified this vintage. The wine is dry and sharp, with green, sharp acids and modest berry, currant and herb flavors.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",14912
"8298","This Syrah-based blend of five different red grapes may be “big” in blending components, but it's quite sleek and elegant on the palate. It's not a deeply concentrated brooding wine, but brisk and spry, offering fresh black-cherry and berry flavors. Soft feathery tannins and notes of cedar and forest floor linger on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",8298
"35357","Kudos to Azalea Springs for bottling this with a screwtop. The vineyard is between St. Helena and Calistoga, at the foot of Diamond Mountain. It has mountain-sized tannins, making it astringently hard. It also has a solid core of blackberry and black currant fruit. This is not one of your soft, gentle cult Cabs, it's one that demands cellaring. Best 2010–2014.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",35357
"42111","The wine seems lean, austere and minerally in character. It has stalky black-currant fruits, firm tannins and forward acids. It should age over 2–3 years, but it will always be on the severe side.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",42111
"17076","A wonderfully firm wine, which balances extraction with pure sweet fruit. It moves comfortably within its tannic structure, the ripe Merlot allowed plenty of play to show off its black jelly and plum flavors.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",17076
"63853","Exuberant notes of tropical passion fruit rise from the glass in this unusually aromatic Grüner Veltliner. Citrusy freshness pervades everything, giving lively direction to the bright, slightly spritzy palate. The finish is zesty, clean and refreshing.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",63853
"41151","This vibrant wine shows how well this grape variety does in Amador County. It melds beautiful, pure, almost jammy aromas and flavors with a rich, layered and soothing texture. The color is quite dark, the aromas drip blackberry and boysenberry, the flavors are deep and the mouthfeel broad.","Red","Barbera","US",41151
"72740","Rich, soft and creamy, with flamboyantly ripe raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, roasted almond, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Tastes like a granola fruit bar in wine form, with a pleasantly hot hit of alcohol. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",72740
"63240","Jean-Marc Lafont's 2.8 acres of sandstone soil in this area of Moulin-à-Vent has produced a ripe, solidly structured wine. Wood aged and with a rich, tight texture and firm tannins, it is a cru wine to age. It is a bold ripe wine, ready to drink from 2019.","Red","Gamay","France",63240
"89254","Black-fruit aromas of cassis and boysenberry are not overdone nor overoaked. Thie palate feels somewhat spiky and acidic, with a tartaric bite. A flavor profile comprised of salty berry fruits finishes briny and herbal, with good weight and balance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",89254
"61960","It's very good, with deep, delicious flavors of tropical fruits, minerals and vanilla, accented with elaborate oak and brightened with crisp acidity. Production was a low 223 cases, but it's worth a search.","White","Chardonnay","US",61960
"34462","Big and blasting on the nose, with heat and burn. The palate is high-wire boysenberry and a lot of acid, and ultimately it borders on sour and fiery, which probably isn't the intention. Wiry and piercing for a pricey, 800-case-production Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",34462
"68298","Cadaretta's largest production red is drinking beautifully in this exceptional vintage. It seems to be moving into midlife softness, with a well-integrated blend of plums, cassis and black cherries, highlighted with clove and coffee. Complex and detailed, its tannins are grainy and dark, adding heft and gravitas to the fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",68298
"29304","Coming from one of Washington's premier Riesling sites, it's redolent with peach, mineral and floral notes. It drinks almost completely dry with bright, crisp acids.","White","Riesling","US",29304
"20068","A two-acre parcel of 75-year-old vines is the source of this jewel of a wine. It is ripe, full bodied and packed with dark fruits. The tannins and the structure promise some aging. Concentrated from the old vines and with a mineral, tight texture, the wine will take its time to be ready. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",20068
"99753","The scent of ripe black fruit veers into raisin territory, but accents of wax and smoked wood add interest. The wine's core is supple, and it deals fine astringent tannins that hold the wine together. Medium to full bodied, this Merlot finishes with bright acidity and a wild berry flavor. It feels warm on the tongue despite having a modest 13% alcohol.","Red","Merlot","US",99753
"54371","Ripe, ruddy cassis and blackberry are threaded with woody tones of briar and tobacco in this lush Pinot Noir. It's rich and silky on the palate, but marked by pert acidity and a long, velveteen finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54371
"57454","The Adelaide Hills aren't known as a hotspot for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this offering, from a warm site, excels. Cinnamon, clove, cracked pepper and vanilla notes accent dark, meaty fruit. It's full and rich enough to be mistaken as coming from a warmer region, with a long, earthy finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",57454
"50611","A wine for early drinking, this is soft, fruity and bright. With red berry flavor and gentle tannins, it's direct and packed with fruitiness. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",50611
"97591","This is a gentle and easy-going Chardonnay. It is soft, lightly buttery and conveys apricot and ripe pear flavors. The aftertaste just touches on acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",97591
"31655","This wine is ripe, with a warm, yellow fruit character. It is bright and poised, elegant and sophisticated. Acidity shoots through the richness, bringing a strong citrus element. Sunny in character, it will still age; drink from late 2016.","White","Chardonnay","France",31655
"62134","Not much Syrah is grown in the Willamette Valley, but Cristom has made it for quite some time now. Tart and astringent, this has black cherry and earth flavors, a light hint of fungus, and chewy tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",62134
"24970","Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins. Flavors of sun-baked raisin and plum fold in chocolate and rubbery notes on a grabby finish that includes residual resiny oak. This could use more time; try after 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",24970
"12721","Both rich and opulent, this complex and dense wine is packed with the richest strawberries and a firm, black core of tannin. The velvet casing of the wine is ripe and generous while still needing many years to age. This is a wine for the long-haul, don't touch before 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",12721
"21492","This informal red opens with aromas that suggest dark-skinned fruit and Mediterranean brush. The dense, simple palate offers juicy black cherry and a hint of dark cooking spice. It closes on a note of bitter almond.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",21492
"59847","With rubbery, smoky aromas and mild berry scents, this light-framed Tempranillo is bright on the palate and easy to quaff. Berry, plum and a touch of bitter chocolate are the flavors.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",59847
"29211","Based on the local Castelão grape, this wine is aged in wood for eight months. Its ripeness and soft tannins are both fruity and lightly structured. It is full-bodied, yet has enough acidity to bring out a juicy, fruity aftertaste.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",29211
"39823","Light berry aromas mix with brine, cumin and sweet spice on the nose. In the mouth, it's rather lean and juicy, with sharp acidity creating fresh red berry flavors and tang. Turns more piercing and citrusy the longer it airs out.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",39823
"27539","The slightest touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose. Underneath, the crisp, slender palate is dominated by appetizing notes of ripe lemon. A tiny bit of spritz makes the slender body seem almost weightless, but all that lovely lemon fruit fills mouth and nose. The finish is featherlight and refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",27539
"5106","Pretty long in the bottle, this rich, soft, thick Zin offers a stewy taste of plums that veers sweet into molasses and jam. On the finish is an additional thickness of black pepper and leather.","Red","Zinfandel","US",5106
"67672","Freshly smashed plum and wild berries show strongly on the nose of this blend of 71% Grenache, 22% Syrah and 7% Mourvèdre, along with dried lilacs and an array of garden and wild herbs, from thyme to oregano. The herbs take center stage on the sip, with wild mint, dried sage and fennel covering the dried plum fruits.","Red","G-S-M","US",67672
"44870","This tiny production blend surely is made in the modern cult style. Its tannins are soft and sexy, its flavors deep and delicious with milk chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and buttery toast. The only thing it lacks is subtlety, but it does deserve its score for sheer Napa power.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",44870
"11184","This Cab is pretty good for the price. It's ripe and fruity, with a full body and rich but soft tannins. Turns a bit treacly on the finish, with a dulcet, honeyed richness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",11184
"98838","Medium bodied and firmly structured, this doesn't show the generosity of the 2009 vintage as much as some other Nothern Rhônes. Instead, it's a traditionally built wine with classic notes of smoke, herbs and black olives, and even some ash-like notes on the finish. Drink 2013–2018.","Red","Syrah","France",98838
"66309","Has the soft, easy but complex tannins that made the appellation famous, and bracing acidity underpinning blackberry, olive and herb flavors. Feels good and rich in the mouth. Try cellaring it for a few years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66309
"70092","Grapes from the Riverbend and Lewis vineyards are often featured in far more expensive bottles. Here they create a 50/50 blend with bright boysenberry fruit and a generous dash of spice and pepper.","Red","Syrah","US",70092
"1490","This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.","White","White Blend","Spain",1490
"22220","This waxy, stalky Pinot Grigio comes with a can't-miss whiff of corn chips prior to a fleshy, flat palate of bland banana flavors. The dull, chunky finish is on its last legs.","White","Pinot Grigio","Chile",22220
"45972","This wine, from selected vineyards owned by the Carrille family, is rich and now mature. Its tannins are merging with the secondary flavors of the fruit as it softens and develops a spice and tobacco character. Drink this wine now.","Red","Merlot","France",45972
"41595","Mushroom aromas indicate a wine that is now mature. It's light, textured with hints of green herbs as well as tannins that are now dry. Not for aging, drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",41595
"87011","Honey, butter, yellow pear, pineapple and vanilla cream show on the supple and soft palate of this bottling—one of the new appellation blends branded under the Nielson name. Sea salt and caramel apple show on the palate, which is underlied and bound by a rain-on-slate minerality, and finishes on an apple custard note.","White","Chardonnay","US",87011
"33771","The rich style of a Setzer wine is here, married to tight acidity, a mineral edge and ripeness. Pepper and white currant flavors come together in a mellifluous whole. Age for a year.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",33771
"14511","An unusual blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Teroldego, this red wine is dry and tannic. The blackberry, currant, mocha and white pepper flavors are drinking well now.","Red","Red Blend","US",14511

"29170","Glowingly ripe pear and juicy yellow plum make a great aromatic opening that continues onto the flavorful palate where it is tempered pleasantly by white pepper and lemon zest. Freshness, verve and drive characterize the concentrated palate. The finish is long and clean.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",29170
"86280","Classy and classic French oak and red cherry aromas combine with raspberry flavors, lively acidity and firm, textured tannins to make a complete, well-balanced wine. This is a bit more austere than many of its peers, but the taut balance and appetizing texture make it more compelling.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86280
"51578","Sweet and easygoing from the start, with candied berry and floral aromas. The palate sits at maximum ripeness, meaning it's sweet and soft but still holds its balance. Flavors of baked berry and brown sugar are generous and smooth, while the finish is mellow and lush.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",51578
"78929","Lusty and forward, this Cab blasts off with explosive cherry, red and black currant, licorice, spicy red plum and mocha flavors. Not very subtle, but it's dry and rich in steak-busting tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",78929
"15248","Rustic and a little sweet tasting, this has flavors of cherry pie, red currant and toast. Drink it with cheeseburgers.","Red","Red Blend","US",15248
"5061","Zin specialist Artezin gets into the Petite Sirah game with this enormously ripe, fruity wine. Shows a modern, cult interpretation of the variety, with blackberry jam, licorice, candied violet, mocha and pepper spice flavors wrapped into huge, but very finely ground, tannins.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",5061

"105515","Densely concentrated, this has subtle aromas of leather, dried plum, nutmeg and a whiff of exotic spice. The robust palate delivers raisin, cassis and pipe tobacco alongside hearty tannins. Made with grapes that were left to dry before fermentation, you'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the close.","Red","Tempranillo","Italy",105515
"104987","This estate wine, originating from the vineyards that has been in the Queyrens family for more than 50 years, offers plenty of fruit here. The taste laces acidity and attractive black-currant flavors. There are tannins and a structure that will allow the wine to develop. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",104987
"81558","Spicy and sharp, with mountain berries and slightly green, bitter tannins. Young and tight, this needs more time to knit itself together.","Red","Malbec","US",81558
"5234","This shows a combination of deep fruit flavors and a firm, tight-grained texture that make it classic in style. Black cherry and black currant flavors are wonderfully accented by impressions of pine forest and dried mushrooms. Baxter matured this wine in 100% neutral French oak barrels, so the taste is all about the Langley grapes and not new oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5234
"78788","This is a mellow, richly fruity wine that feels smooth, is lightly tannic, and has full body and ripe raisin and black plum flavors. It flts the bill when you want a concentrated but easy-going wine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",78788

"41986","This is a big, rich Cabernet whose powerful fruit stars. Blackberries, cherries, plums, cassis, cocoa and oak flavors flood the palate, dazzling despite the firm tannins. This holds its own with more expensive Cabernets from Napa Valley, and should develop well over the next 5–6 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",41986
"54125","Made using 50% Barbera and 50% Alicante Bouschet, this wine is fragrant and full-bodied, with notes of toasty oak and leather. The blend spent more than a year in new French oak, and it shows, both in terms of taste and structure. Should be an interesting wine over time.","Red","Red Blend","US",54125
"32723","There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",32723
"106681","Well-drained gravel soil gives this wine its crisp and dry character. It is ripe and fruity, although the spice is subdued in favor of a more serious structure. This is a wine to age for a couple of years, so drink from 2017.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",106681
"3163","This is a strong, firm wine with an initially earthy aroma that fills out with the scent of dark black fruits. The structure of the wine is taut, dark and brooding, offering serious potential for aging. Its bold acidity and young tannins further suggest aging, so drink between 2016–2024. Langdon Shiverick, Comète Wines.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",3163
"69692","Smoky, rubbery aromas of berry and cassis are lightly herbal. This has a firm mouhtfeel with piercing acidity. Salty, briny plum and berry flavors lead to a finish that holds onto the saline notes and feels crisp.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",69692
"98306","The winery is in eastern Oregon, near the Idaho border, but the grapes were sourced from an unnamed Willamette Valley vineyard. It's a toasty wine, pleasing and easy-drinking, with pretty red cherry fruit. A dash of iron and some roasted coffee flavors add interest.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98306
"49602","Linear and loaded with finesse, this delicate, polished red opens with fragrant blue flower, berry and crushed herb scents. The bright, ethereal palate offers sour cherry, strawberry and a hint of baking spice, framed by silky tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",49602
"58336","This is a sweet, very perfumed wine with pleasant candy flavors. Rich rosewater and spice notes add complexity, and chalk soils lend a crisp edge that cuts into the opulent character of the wine. It could age, not for long, so drink until 2018.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",58336
"16008","Oxidative in character, this ripe wine has melon, spice and almond flavors. It is ready to drink.","White","Vermentino","France",16008
"61648","Alta Maria's appellation bottling is a bit leaner than the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but quite elegant, with flint, pink grapefruit, mango and spearmint flavors, enhanced by a touch of oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",61648
"48496","Buttered toast, caramel, vanilla bean, spice and pineapple and orange jam aromas and flavors mark this wine. It's a little sweet and white sugary on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",48496
"7938","A ripe wine, blended from fruit from across Touraine, this lively, smooth wine has a touch of sweetness at the end. That makes for a wine that's ready to drink with a soft aftertaste.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",7938
"8382","Dominated by red fruits, this wine also has the structure of 2010. It is firm and concentrated while always fruity and accessible. It could be kept for a few months, but really is ready to drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",8382
"80697","A light lime flavor comes with a pleasing hint of tangerine in this wine. It becomes quite slender as it rapidly runs into a slightly metallic finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",80697
"6663","The Belland family has an acre of vines in this prestigious Premier Cru. Ripe while shot through with intense acidity, the wine is finely balanced. Touches of wood aging give the wine a creamy toasty texture. That contrasts with the more mineral fruity character that leaves the wine crisp at the end. Drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",6663
"18774","Rich and delicious, this has flavors of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie, buttered toast and smoky butterscotch that are balanced by fine acidity and dry, firm minerality.","White","Chardonnay","US",18774
"60534","A gold color and oaky aromas of popcorn, buttered corn and stone fruits open this chunky, resiny, oak-heavy Chardonnay. Oaky, buttery flavors carry over from the nose, and oak spice dominates the finish on this full-bodied but not very fruity offering.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",60534
"85018","A rich, smooth wine, all ripe black fruit and soft tannins. It has weight and depth, but is ready to drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",85018
"29704","While the nose reveals only faint whiffs of apples, nuts and brambles, the palate of this off-dry Riesling is crisply concentrated with fresh red apples and tart peaches. It's not a deeply persistent wine, but finishes brisk and bright.","White","Riesling","Germany",29704
"7218","The nose is lifted with bright spice and suggestions of pungent herbs. Black fruits carry a touch of mocha and lead into a crisp, moderately tannic finish. Balance and length are excellent.","Red","Sangiovese","US",7218
"16081","A stunning white with superb balance and layer upon layer of aromas and flavors. An expressive white-flower note accents the solid backbone of ripe red apple and firm nectarine fruit. The medium-weight palate is slightly creamy but not overdone, with hints of toast, sweet spice and almond-flavored nuttiness that unfold on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",16081
"53801","Smooth in texture and layered in flavor, this is well-balanced. The color is not too dark and the aromas and flavors recall red cherries and flowers. Mild tannins and fresh acidity help hold everything together.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53801
"77156","Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",77156
"48033","Made in small quantities, this wine opens in a decadence of gingerbread and graham cracker aromas before a medium-bodied texture supports a supple ripeness of green apple, melon and pear.","White","Chardonnay","US",48033

The smooth, delicious palate offers layers of fleshy black cherry, baking spice and dried Mediterranean herb while firm, refined tannins provide the framework.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",8102
"103953","Pinot Noir from Canada can often be quite delicate, but this is a full-bodied, even muscular effort. Toasty and tasty, it puts a pleasant roasted character upon ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. Tannins are substantial, along with some barrel flavors from nine months in French oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","Canada",103953
"52312","A Bordeaux-style blend, this begins with concentrated strawberry and cherry flavors, rich and liquorous. A majority of the oak was Hungarian, and a strong vanilla streak runs through the middle and on into the finish. For some palates the fruit and the oak will seem a bit mismatched, but for others this will be right on the mark.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",52312
"47386","This lovely, evocative wine celebrates the finesse that characterizes the finest Pinot Noirs. Delicate nuances of bramble, cinnamon, tar and nougat wrap around and weave through a core of black cherry fruit. Ample acidity ensures much life ahead, through at least 2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47386
"43385","This is a perfumed wine that has just pure berry fruits, red plums and spice from tannins. There's no wood aging here, but the wine succeeds because of its delicious ripe fruits and balancing sweet acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",43385

The crisp finish is quite dry and winds up with a peach accent. Drink up before 2011.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",50361

"2638","Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2638
"6973","Comes across as rather round and lush on the palate, with tropical fruit flavors of guava and pineapple. It's easy to drink and enjoy for its fruity immediacy and mouthwatering finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",6973

"83569","The Mark VI (similar to the above Heather's Vineyard) is a sort of reserve reserve, this one from barrels chosen to showcase the most cellar-worthy aspects of the vintage. It succeeds nicely, delivering a solid, firm, tart wine with young raspberry and cherry fruit at its center. The tannins have a lightly herbal, leafy streak, and there's little doubt this will benefit from additional years in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83569
"66678","This is a rich finely structured wine from Sogrape's Alentejo estate which is located close to the best place in Europe to stargaze. Powered with tannins as well as black fruits, this blend of Syrah, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional is dense and very ageworthy. Drink starting from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",66678
"16063","A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",16063
"42212","Oak, pepper, cinnamon and clove aromas give this red a masculine, exotic edge. On the palate, cherry, tea and cinnamon flavors are likeable and easy to drink. A fun red for everyday enjoyment.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",42212
"58905","This opens with ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush and baking spice aromas, while the dense, robust palate offers black cherry jam, clove and licorice flavors. It's already accessible, with fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",58905
"56463","A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",56463
"54128","While this Cab may be a touch soupy and heavy on the nose, aromas of coffee grounds and berry fruits are good. A full, blocky palate features cheek-rubbing tannins, while this tastes of coffee, chocolate and herbal berry fruits. For everyday purposes, this makes the grade.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",54128
"78101","This soft, gentle wine has some attractive citrus and apple fruits. Easy to drink, it offers a crisp tangy aftertaste. It is not a wine for aging, so drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",78101
"14863","Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry. A trace of minerality fights for attention around a medium body, finishing fairly quick.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",14863
"73393","The orange, apple and hay notes here taste slightly mature, but have character and appeal. Medium weight, with a faintly viscous feel, the wine finishes dry and smooth. Verdejo generally shows better younger and brisker, but this is still good current drinking. —M.M.","White","Verdejo","Spain",73393
"74958","Mossy, balsamic aromas of baked berry fruits and root beer are soft and friendly. In the mouth, this is chunky and fairly tannic, with no glaring holes. Rooty flavors of baked berries and mocha finish with molasses and root beer notes.","Red","Shiraz","Argentina",74958
"39807","A deep, developed wine with cola, licorice and prune aromas. The palate is poised and balanced even if it's rich and very ripe. Layered in the mouth, with plum, prune, chocolate, coffee and fine spice, which is about as complete a package as you'll find with Malbec. Cabernet and Syrah; drink now through 2015.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",39807
"38628","This bold, perfumed Cabernet Franc is richly, lusciously textured, as if infused with a heady dose of crème de cassis. Ripe, ruddy black cherry and berry flavors are plump and forward, cut by brisk acidity and a jagged edge of tannin on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",38628
"17356","The nose of this bottling from a stone-strewn vineyard in the heart of the appellation is very restrained, offering wet concrete, lime and lemon pith scents, with a touch of sweet chive. Pink grapefruit and petrol notes show on the palate, which is layered with an intriguingly sticky texture.","White","Riesling","US",17356
"91631","The Cab-based blend is so ripe and fruity, it's almost a dessert wine, except it finishes dry. Brims with ripe, forward raspberries, cherries and red currants, with lots of vanilla bean and toast from oak barrels. It will age for 7–8 years, gradually shedding fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",91631
"29509","A tart, tangy Shiraz of only medium weight, this wine offers only moderately complex flavors of plum, tinged with coffee, leather and black olive.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",29509
"96860","Shiraz (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Malbec (12%) combine in this medium-bodied silky-textured blend. Hints of eucalyptus linger around the margins, while the core of the wine features raspberry and cherry fruit. It's soft and easy to drink, and made for near-term consumption.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",96860
"67152","Aromas of cherries baked in a flaky vanilla crust meet with cola, fresh boysenberry and damp herbs on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. Bright raspberry shows on the lighter-framed and very energetic palate, with flavors of fennel frond, dried marjoram and a gravel-laced minerality.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67152
"33294","A balanced aromatic show of campfire smoke, purple fruit and violet-driven florals emerges on the nose of this affordable wine from Don Sebastiani & Sons. It's a little watery on the palate, but then shows a nice array of blackberry fruit, black pepper, graphite earthiness and a vanilla finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",33294
"43013","Muted on the nose, this soft wine co-fermented with 9% Petite Sirah offers rich red cherry, blackberry and layers of clove and lavender. Lush, it finishes in firm tannins and oak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",43013
"65505","Dark, brooding and baked in character, this well-made wine is a study in red and black licorice tones, with juicy blue fruit at the core. Good grip and power find structure around a full body and leathery finish.","Red","Malbec","US",65505
"50311","This wine is flat and capped on the nose. On the palate, it's angular and narrow, with cidery flavors and little to no complexity.","White","Gewürztraminer","Chile",50311
"52316","A cool vintage shows through in the lighter style of this Merlot. Strawberry is the dominant fruit flavor, although the time in new oak is what dominates currently. The scent and vanilla flavor of American oak, though accounting just 20% of the barrels, comes across quite powerfully. Give this one another year or two.","Red","Merlot","US",52316
"78712","While forward with stonefruit and honey, along with toasty oak and vanilla notes, this is a structured Viognier that's crisp and fresh. Drink with Thai food or buttery lobster.","White","Viognier","US",78712
"61384","Minerally grapefruit, white peach, lettuce and scallion aromas are clean, inviting and textbook for Verdejo. A fresh, racy, cleansing palate holds grapefruit, orange and briny flavors. This is crisp as a whistle on the finish, but light on flavor and complexity. Drink now.","White","Verdejo","Spain",61384
"54213","Medium weight with soft, dusty tannins, this wine is easily approachable now. Juicy and jammy flavors of red berry preserves are complemented by nuances of iris. A straightforward wine that will pair nicely with most game-based dishes.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",54213
"68157","A blend of Syrah and Grenache from organic vineyards gives a herbal, very southern taste to this ripe wine. It is still young and showing both acidity and a firm structure. As it develops further, it will get a rich, full and plummy character. Drink from 2017.","Red","Red Blend","France",68157
"5800","Simple, tannic and harsh, with sugared blackberry tea, raisin and black pepper flavors.","Red","Malbec","US",5800
"76207","Aged 18 months in French oak, this 100% varietal wine has notes of chocolate, leather, herbs and spice. The fruit flavors are sweet and luscious with very tightly wound, dry tannins.","Red","Tempranillo","US",76207

"42587","This combines nearly proportional percentages of all five Bordeaux varieties, grown on the founder's estate, allowing each room to speak. The Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot together make up the majority, paving the road to full-bodied ripeness with supportive acidity, the highlights being smoky plum, blackberry and mocha.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",42587
"13655","Attractive floral scents of crushed rose and pressed violet are joined by perfumed berry and a hint of menthol. The elegant, focused palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper, clove and chopped herb alongside a firm network of fine-grained tannins. It's still young and tight but loaded with finesse. Drink 2019–2031.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",13655
"80360","This is a bold combination of 89% Dolcetto from the Napa side of Carneros and 11% Barbera from one of its happy spots in the state, El Dorado County. Big bodied and tannic on entry, it softens in the glass to reveal bright red cherry and spearmint, with a touch of bitterness on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",80360
"69700","This is pure varietal, about one fifth new oak. From young vines, it's sharp-toned, dark and juicy. Cassis, dark chocolate and coffee showcase a wine with a strong grip, tight and tannic. This needs time, but the fruit is crisply defined and immaculate; the varietal character peeks through in a hint of tanned leather.","Red","Tempranillo","US",69700
"6829","Aromas of dark-skinned berry, leather and truffle take shape in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, orange zest, licorice, clove and coffee bean while notes of chopped mint lift the finish. Firm fine-grained tannins give it structure and finesse. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",6829
"11654","This blend of Incrocio Manzoni and Vermentino opens with bold floral intensity, plus solid background tones of peach and lemon mousse. It offers a creamy, soft mouthfeel that could stand up to white meat or shellfish.","White","White Blend","Italy",11654
"81565","Mannina gets some nice accolades for its Sangiovese, and is planting its new vineyard with several different Italian varieties. This new release shows Chianti-like structure, color and texture. It's ripened to pretty strawberry fruit flavors, with suggestions of tobacco leaf and plenty of acid. Neutral barrels were used, allowing the fruit to remain in focus.","Red","Sangiovese","US",81565
"72001","A real crowd pleaser for its sumptuous array of ripe berry and spice flavors. Wherever the grapes come from in California, they've given a delicious wine, soft and gentle, and filled with cherry, black raspberry, sweet licorice, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",72001
"80464","Soft Honeycomb cereal, toasted apple skin and pear lead the nose of this accessible wine, with pleasant hints of fresh herbs.

"62472","The inviting aromas mix smoke, tobacco, cassis and cedar. There's no fat on this wine; it's lithe and lingering, with fresh blackberry fruit along with black olive and graphite. It should drink quite well now through 2026.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Canada",62472
"27155","Aroma of baked plum, French oak, vanilla, coconut and espresso carry over to the densely concentrated, one-dimensional palate along with raisin, roasted coffee bean and evident alcohol. Astringent tannins leave a grippy finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",27155
"55598","Very tentative hints of earthy red fruit are all that can be discerned on the nose. The palate is lithe and soft and slightly edged with fine sprays of white pepper amidst very tender red fruit: is it cranberry? Red fruit just shimmers through and wants to be coaxed out. The delicate aftertaste of forest floor, cranberry and pepper is a joy.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",55598
"42825","Neutral on the nose except for some apple and cheesy oak. The palate is angular and tangy, with cidery flavors. Finishes similarly, with lasting acidic bite and zest.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",42825
"8723","Unusually, Tibouren (a red grape more often found further east near Nice) forms part of the blend of this wine along with white Clairette. The mix gives a spicy, very perfumed wine that has ripe apricot and raspberry fruits. A strong peppery undertow suggests this is more of a food wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",8723
"37913","The nose on this bottling leans a bit sweet yet remains zesty, with ripe apples, pears, lime sorbet and lemon-lime soda. But the sip is racy and sizzling with buoyant acidity, delivering tightly wound Bosc pear and Gravenstein apple flavors doused with citrus spray.","White","Chardonnay","US",37913
"77609","Cheesy aromas of leather, licorice and black fruits filter into a jagged, fiercely tannic palate. Flavors of tea, black plum, stewed berry and herbs finish with a big residual tannic bite.","Red","Petite Sirah","Chile",77609
"55180","Located high in the hills of central Sicily, Regaleali is one of the south's leaders. Tasca is the famil name, and their huge estate, replete with the latest technology, continues to impress. This basic red proves to be a very solid everyday wine, featuring flavors of plum, spice, and a touch of mint. Perfect balance with a long finish ensures its success. Best Buy","Red","Red Blend","Italy",55180
"19143","For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",19143
"33015","Software developer-turned-vintner Mike Officer comes south from his Sonoma base to Monterey make this lavish Syrah that shows layers of blueberry, blackberry and black cassis as well as potpourri and ganache elements. Those same fruits hit the sip too, along with licorice, pretty purple flowers and an ever-increasing asphalt component.","Red","Syrah","US",33015
"17808","Soft and thick, this Syrah has simple, sugary flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",17808
"21433","Strawberry hulls, earth and a touch of bittersweet black tea combine in this full-bodied, expressive wine with a slight, reductive quality and spicy acidity. From a spot on the Santa Rosa Plain, it comes from a mix of clones and is soft on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21433
"70986","Ripe, jammy fruitiness gives this wine a generous feel. Packed with opulent berry flavor, it will develop well. It is rich and rounded, nicely supported by the tannins that are in the background. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",70986
"37257","The 2013 Josef Vineyard is quieter on the nose than the more exuberant Magdalena, but the palate packs plenty of luscious fruit and floral punch. Semidry in style, it's feather light in texture yet concentrated apricot and yellow-cherry flavors are penetrating and persistent. Delicious now but will improve through 2023.","White","Riesling","US",37257
"21505","Part of a Limited Release series, this supple, oaky Malbec includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Made from Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard fruit, this offers compelling blue- and black-fruit flavors that are wrapped in coffee and cream notes. It's a structured wine that can be cellared up to a decade.","Red","Malbec","US",21505
"66706","How can a Barossa Shiraz be so green? Its flavors are herbal to the point of being close to cabbage or green bean, with just enough high-toned cherry fruit to be acceptable. —J.C.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",66706
"82877","Barnyard aromas atop berry scents make for a nose that's not entirely clean. A clipped, tough palate has hard tannins and short berry flavors. A finish with heat and bitterness makes this a tough go.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",82877
"89992","Weighty and dry, Albariño is a rare sight in Sonoma. This one is well worth seeking, savory in nutty almond and a taste of grilled peach. Mouth quenching, it'll pair well with spicy Thai shrimp.","White","Albariño","US",89992
"98437","Rich and rounded in character, this is already a beautiful wine, from 80-year-old vines. A line of acidity shoots through the wine, giving a long lift to the green fruits and orange zest flavors. It does have weight and a generous texture that reveals itself slowly. Ripe apricots mingle with acidity and toast at the end. Drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",98437
"92892","Floral, oily aromas are not typical of Chardonnay. A plump, melony mouthfeel is chunky, while this wine tastes both tropical and bitter, with a bath-soap character.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",92892
"62036","Fruity and simple, with pie-filling flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and honeysuckle. Shows good coastal acidity, but could use greater depth and complexity.","White","Roussanne","US",62036
"35421","This soft Chardonnay has flavors of honey, tangerine and pineapple, with a creamy texture and a touch of oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",35421
"7325","Puy means a hill, and the steep slopes of the Côte du Puy offer great exposure for the vines. The result is a densely structured, very muscular wine that shows richness as well as dark tannins. The aftertaste is sweet, streaked with acidity.","Red","Gamay","France",7325
"8453","Here's a blend of 85% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that offers succulent plum, black currant and prune flavors layered with notes of oak, spice and cocoa. While rich fruit and smooth tannins make this appealing now, fresh acidity gives this some staying power. Drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",8453
"83269","Intensely dark blackberry fruit meets with game and minty chocolate on the nose of this appellation blend by Adam Lee. The flavors are woody with forest undergrowth, and surround a core of mulberry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83269
"27316","This has pleasant oak aromas suggesting buttered toast, and fairly rich, ripe fruit flavors that resemble peach, pear and a touch of fig. The texture is smooth, almost creamy, the body is medium and the flavors stay fresh through the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",27316
"35617","This is a rich, toasty white Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Notes of honey, melon and pineapple mark the nose and palate, while the finish is warm and long, with lingering hints of popcorn and roasted nuts.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",35617
"32672","Too heavy for a rosé, with black cherry, cola and leather flavors that lack the delicacy and zest you want in a blush wine.","Red","Sangiovese","US",32672
"103908","The unique nose of this wine shows crystalline lime candy and nectarine flesh, along with a sharper yet plush tangerine blossom aroma. The palate plays the cut-grass note with pride, offering bell pepper, jalapeño, green peppercorn and kaffir lime flavors, sewn together with a tightly wound acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",103908
"53315","Charred, minty black-fruit aromas include shoe polish, leather and earth notes. At first, this is plush in feel, but in no time it becomes hard as stone, with fierce tannins. Minty, oaky flavors of mixed spices and herbal blackberry are earthy and brawny on the finish, with punishing tannins. Drink 2018–2035.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",53315
"47947","Bramble, leather and red fruit make for a decent nose, while the palate is basically deep and fruity, with an emphasis on blackberry and cherry flavors. For the most part the wine has structure and feel, although there's a spot of bitterness on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",47947
"60264","After three years in the bottle, this Grenache-Syrah blend still needs time to integrate. The core is full of red cherry flavor, but accented with notes of Canadian bacon, cola, black pepper and sandalwood. Give it 2–4 years to let all the parts converge.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",60264
"27288","Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",27288
"46395","Milk chocolate, dark cherry, herb and floral notes are followed by silky smooth pit fruit flavors that linger.","Red","Red Blend","US",46395
"66326","Foresty earth notes wrap spiced plum, vanilla and toast flavors. The light weight and refreshing acids lead to the clean, toasty finish. More depth would contribute to a higher score.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",66326
"24013","Crushed apricot flesh framed by mandarin and lemon freshness sets the tone. Where the nose is full of charm, the palate is full of verve. Exciting, almost electric freshness flashes on the palate and makes for a dynamic, streamlined but structured drink. Somewhere in the background, notes of honey lurk deliciously.","White","Riesling","Austria",24013
"10242","This is an herbal, almost throwback style of Carmenère. The nose delivers a blast of tomato leaf along with a rooty, herbal aroma of red fruit suggestive of pizza. The palate is tight and smacks hard with tannins, while the core flavors are roasted and burnt, with a baked berry note and an earthy nuttiness.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",10242
"7130","The wine is ripe and soft, with a style that is more towards tropical fruits. So apricots, ripe pears are cut with crisp acidity. The wine is tangy at the end with orange zest flavors. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",7130

"102978","This aromatic offering has notes of mineral, fireplace, cured meat and game. It's creamy and rich in feel, showing great texture, depth and richness, with savory flavors out in front of the fruit initially. It's just starting to stretch its legs, so give it plenty of time to open up.","Red","Syrah","US",102978
"27628","From the producer's estate site, in homage to her Spanish heritage, this white sizzles in varietal typicity, showing bright, forward notions of green apple, peach and a compelling wet-stone minerality that provides a gravelly edge to the texture. It lingers in honeysuckle.","White","Albariño","US",27628
"80676","The fruit isn't the star of this wine; instead, intense notes of forest floor and cola spice dominate the nose and palate. Sure, the red berry and cherry flavors are there, but they're just hanging in the background of this bright yet herbaceous selection.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",80676
"16330","This big, dark, rubbery smelling Ribera wine is rugged and pushy, with mild volatility on the nose along with a whiff of spent coffee grinds. A clampy, bullish palate with rock-hard tannins sets up rubbery black-fruit flavors in front of a rough and tumble finish. Overall this is very good but hard and tannic. Hold for a year then drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",16330
"15933","There's a nice, lightly silky texture to this Pinot Noir. It's rich in raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors that finish dry, with a touch of sweet oak. More problematic is the acidity. It doesn't feel natural, and sticks out, the way acidity does in Riesling. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15933
"21937","Aromas of fresh citrus fruits, crushed vitamins and nectarine are pleasant and welcoming. This offers good acidic cut and overall balance. Flavors of stone fruits focus on apricot and nectarine, while the finish is elegant.","White","Albariño","Spain",21937
"25345","This pleasant, medium-bodied wine stays 11 months in French oak (30% new), so there's plenty of barrel influence. The cherry and herb notes manage to stand up to the wood treatment, which adds a layer of mocha flavor and a touch of bitterness. Drink now–2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",25345
"42801","Very sweet, with white sugar, raspberry, chocolate and sweet vanilla bean flavors, enriched with the glycerine of high alcohol. There's fine acidity and tannins, yet the fruity concentration falls short. Drink up.","Red","Zinfandel","US",42801
"1241","Aromatic hints of new wood translate onto the smooth palate. It has smoke and black currant flavors, with tannins that are already well integrated. Attractive acidity gives this a final lift. Keep it for 5–6 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",1241
"82561","Shows the qualities that are making this Spanish variety so popular.

"82584","Goutorbe is a member of the Spécial Club grouping of grower producers, which tastes and approves each other's special cuvée. This 2005, with its ripe fruits and the beginnings of bottle age, is a worthy member. It has delicious apple and white peach fruits, lively acidity and a texture that is moving towards toastiness. The wine is ready to drink.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",82584
"66007","A blend of Sauvignon and Chardonnay, this has subdued aromas of toast and orchard fruit. The linear palate is on the lean side, offering yellow apple skin, oak and a hint of citrus. It closes on a bitter-almond note.","White","White Blend","Italy",66007
"83335","This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.","White","Chardonnay","US",83335
"81056","Rich and fruity, this wine is a full-bodied rosé. It has ripe red fruits and a touch of tannin along with balanced acidity. With its up-front richness, it is a food wine, rather than an apéritif.","Rosé","Rosé","France",81056

Really fine, with a good backbone of tannins. Now–2011.","Red","Syrah","US",87144
"78410","Given that this is where Santa Barbara County's first Syrah was planted, it's no wonder that Zaca Mesa makes well-balanced expressions of the grape with stunning consistency. This bottling shows blackberry, black pepper, cola and purple flowers on the nose, leading into a tightly structured palate packed with tart black-plum skins, beef char and more black-pepper dust.","Red","Syrah","US",78410
"97739","Dry and full in the mouth, this Pinot has a fine weight and structure. It's made from the various vineyards Testarossa buys grapes from, and is virtually as good as the vineyard-designated bottlings, which makes it a value. Shows cherry, cola, tangerine zest and spicy flavors. Good through 2010 or so.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",97739
"24822","Cavallotto (Tenuta Bricco Boschis) offers a dark and powerful Riserva with a masculine, brooding personality complete with black spice, peppercorn, licorice, cola, prune and blackberry preserves. The wine concludes with a soft, velvety mouthfeel.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",24822
"8280","White fruits, fennel and Serrano ham aromas create a sophisticated bouquet. This jabs away on the palate courtesy of citric acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus are good. It finishes dry and foamy.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",8280
"105786","A blend of Syrah (70%), Grenache (25%) and Mourvèdre, this tantalizing wine offers a near endless list of aromatic descriptors, from white pepper to smoked meat, currant, mineral, licorice, coffee and dried herbs, seeming to evolve with each swirl. The palate is layered and rich with plum, pomegranate and lingering dark fruit flavors. It drinks best at a cool 62 degrees.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",105786
"80348","Ripe and rustic, this is a good everyday Merlot made for simple fare. It's rich and direct in blackberry pie, cherry jam, cola, cocoa and smoky vanilla flavors.","Red","Merlot","US",80348
"33777","T-L's 2007s from the Northern Rhône came out well, including this example from Saint-Joseph. Intense espresso, cracked pepper and black olive notes scream of cool-climate Syrah, while the feel in the mouth is supple, ending on a silky note.","Red","Syrah","France",33777
"51034","From hillside vineyards on just one acre of the producer's estate, this lovely wine is pungently earthy in violet and fresh compost, its profile bright and lean. Cherry, orange and pomegranate make for a compelling expression of the variety, complemented by a meaty, gamy tease on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","US",51034
"46278","Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers.","White","Riesling","Germany",46278
"103182","Bold, oak-driven aromas of dill, chocolate-covered almonds and brown butter transition through to the medium- to full-bodied palate, which is marked by a pleasing note of liquid rock. The palate feels easygoing and malleable, but chalky tannins and balanced acids give it a sense of structure.","Red","Malbec","US",103182
"63348","This is a ripe wine with black-cherry fruit and some firm tannins. It is just now mature, packed with vivid fruit and acidity. The wine is ready to drink.","Red","Gamay","France",63348
"78552","Hints of thyme, sage, violet and coffee are just a handful of the nuances that color this composed Bordeaux-style Blend. Brisk acidity balances the bold, ripe fruit, leading to a fresh, herbaceous finish with penetrating tannins. Drink now over a long evening, or better yet, cellar it for 3–5 years to let all of the components come together.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",78552
"94811","The nose on Josh Jensen's latest vintage is expertly restrained, suggesting honey- and lemon-laced chamomile tea. The flavors are even and nicely arced, with tart lime moving into pear flesh and finishing with butter-scorched lemon and custard.","White","Viognier","US",94811
"70925","A tart, tight and tannic Merlot, that shows simple flavors of young red fruits. It is still quite hard and compact, and seems likely to remain so.","Red","Merlot","US",70925
"52732","Inviting aromas of tobacco, earth, cedar and bacon give weight to racy berry scents. It's stripped and tight as a drum on the palate, with fiery acidity creating tangy raspberry and plum flavors accented by notes of tobacco, wood spice and citrus. This is best enjoyed with food; on its own it's a bit sharp.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",52732
"8309","Like most Colomé Malbecs, this is purple in color, with concentrated aromas of rubber, herbs and jammy blackberry. A thick, almost soupy palate is chewy and cushioned, while saturated black-fruit flavors finish heavy, jammy and on the cusp of overdone.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",8309
"85036","A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",85036
"37815","A full, fruity, slightly hot Chardonnay. The barrel aging—all French, 60% new—brings the expected toastiness. This is a solidly made, fruit-forward style, immediately ready for drinking.","White","Chardonnay","US",37815
"28913","While initially a bit earthy and savory on the nose, this ethereal kabinett abounds in fruity, floral complexities. Cutting and spry, its sweet, tangy citrus and stone-fruit flavors seem to dance nervously on the palate. It's nuanced and minerally, with a deliciously salty finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",28913
"18798","Mineral notes on the nose build in intensity throughout this brisk, invigorating semidry Riesling. Spine-tingling lemon-lime acidity offsets a palate full of luscious yellow peach and honey flavors. Finishes long with a spray of lavender.","White","Riesling","Germany",18798
"35033","This wine is a blend of Grenache, Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris. Salmon colored, it offers light notes of red apple, melon and a hint of strawberry. The flavors are dry and generous, with a broad feel bringing a lot of appeal.","Rosé","Rosé","US",35033
"63783","A bright strawberry-flavored wine, this is fruity and fresh. It has crisp acidity to lift the fruit and a light pepper touch that adds interest and turns it into a fine food-friendly wine. It is ready to drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",63783
"81772","Oak dominates this Zin-based blend, which contains Petite Sirah, Carignane and Mataro (Mourvèdre). The underlying wine is as rich as the very fine 2008, with berry, cherry, currant, leather and spice flavors. But sweet, caramelized oak rules, to the wine's detriment.","Red","Zinfandel","US",81772
"1381","Flamboyantly rich in cherries, raspberries and cranberries that are a bit tart, yet enriched with sweet oak. Firm acidity brings everything to a clean, bright finish. A pretty wine, showing elegance and finesse.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1381
"86291","A blend of 80% Sangiovese with the remaining made up of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit and espresso. The straightforward palate offers black plum and clove alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",86291
"6282","Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.","White","Albariño","Spain",6282
"40061","Smells and tastes over-oaked; a little too acidic and thin in flavor. The oak tannins are strongly astringent.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",40061
"6958","Smoky, dark and rich, this oak-aged Ripasso is packed tight with savory aromas of barbecue smoke, bresaola, licorice and sun-dried fruit. There's a sweet note on the close followed by smooth, soft tannins.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",6958
"24635","The aromas are tight and nervous with notes of wild berry, ginger and licorice. It is firmly astringent, so give it a few more years to help soften the tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",24635
"59443","Fairly heavy and full, with a powerfully spicy and chocolaty nose. Dark-fruit and herb tastes are accented by a strong shot of coffee from the oak. The finish is tannic and drying, with more of that coffee and also some notes of licorice. Perfectly chunky, in the Napa/Oakville style.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",59443
"57735","This wine offers intriguing notes of peach, mango and spice. It's lighter in style with just off-dry fruit flavors that linger.","White","Viognier","US",57735
"73746","There's magic up in Hank Beckmeyer's hills. The Suma Kaw Vineyard in the Sierra Foothills is a prized source for Rhône varieties, where the Mourvèdre typically gets blended in with Syrah, but not here, where it is given room to exude fresh, bright, earthy tones amid an intensity of raspberry, strawberry and just-ripe cherry. A hint of leather surfaces on the finish.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",73746
"49910","The best of this year's crop of Saint Clair Pinots is the Pioneer Block 4, which boasts dark and mysterious aromas of damp earth and ripe plums. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, with hints of mocha emerging on the supple finish. Drink now–2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",49910
"42376","This wine is 82% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, coming from Cold Creek and Four Feathers vineyards. Designed with the specific intent of aging, brooding aromas of blue and red fruit, earth and spice lead to a saturated seamless palate. It drinks beautifully now, but should have a long life in front of it. Best after 2022.","Red","Merlot","US",42376
"28866","A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah from vineyards near Laudun, this is a typical blend that isn't typical in flavor. Crisp, dusty notes of cinnamon, red peppercorn and pomegranate predominate, making this medium-bodied wine interesting, if not incredibly hedonistic.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",28866
"42818","This is a simple, easy- drinking Zinfandel, soft and gentle and slightly sweet. The raspberry, licorice, raisin and cocoa flavors are rich and spicy.","Red","Zinfandel","US",42818
"40521","This organic vineyard in the northern reaches of Tejo regularly produces concentrated wines like this. It's richly endowed with fine tannins and black fruit but also has the sort of structure that will allow it to age well. Drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",40521
"100006","A delightful Riesling, sweetly aromatic, and balanced with some residual sugar. It has well-crafted flavors of pear and vanilla.","White","Riesling","US",100006
"92799","This saw no new wood at all, and comes out of the bottle somewhat reduced, with aromas of rubber and little fruit. Decant and/or aerate it, and the flavors of pomegranate juice and black licorice arise, along with a definite green streak. This should be consumed in the next two or three years.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",92799
"102580","Layered aromas of blackberry, cassis, leather and dried cheese are inviting. In the mouth, this Garnacha from vines more than 100-years-old is jammy and friendly. Candied almost syrupy flavors of blackberry and black cherry finish dense and chocolaty, with modest acidity. Drink through 2017.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",102580
"80378","Vegan friendly and made with organic grapes, this fresh informal rosé has subtle aromas of red berry, wild flower and a whiff of tilled soil. The easygoing palate offers sour cherry and a hint of dried sage.","Rosé","Rosé","Italy",80378
"63186","Peach aromas include a note of stone-fruit pit, while citrus is the other standout scent on an elegant nose. This wine is citrusy in feel, with good body and clarity. Flavors of orange and ripe grapefruit finish in fresh, clean fashion.","White","Albariño","Spain",63186
"66433","Stoan is a bright white blend from northeast Italy that shows balance, freshness and intensity. Long aromas of stone fruit, melon, tangerine skin and white almond set the tone. The wine performs beautifully in the mouth thanks to its soft texture.","White","White Blend","Italy",66433
"39166","Violet blossoms and orange peel aromatics jump out, followed by scents and flavors of lamb tartare and mixed charcuterie. Cofermented with 5% Viognier, it's an elegant and beautifully proportioned wine, offering ripe purple fruits with finishing hints of baking spices and dark chocolate.","Red","Syrah","US",39166
"49032","Compact, almost gritty aromas of tree bark and herbal berry fruits require time to breathe. After necessary airing, this is elegant and fresh on the palate, but full in body. Herbal plum and berry flavors are leathery, spicy and suggest tomato as this transitions to a firm, racy finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",49032
"86409","While forward, plump red-cherry and strawberry notes are buoyant, a deep vein of granite and minerals adds gravitas and complexity to this elegant wine. Fresh cranberry acidity drives a swift finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86409
"50987","Ripe and full of raspberries, this has a structure well cushioned by the ripe texture. The wine is packed with acidity while having a sense of floral, aromatic fruitiness. From four different parcels in premier cru, this seductive wine will also age well. Drink from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",50987
"4703","Plum, sassafras and dark cherry form a contingency of flavor in this brooding, velvety smooth wine with a sizable finish. Cinnamon and clove are peppered throughout this full-bodied, well-made effort from the famous vineyard site.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4703
"41761","Deliciously drinkable, this is one of the best California Grenaches in recent memory. Complexity is not Grenache's strong point, but lusciousness is, when the wine is well made. The cherry pie filling, raspberry tart and cinnamon spice flavors, enriched with smoky sandalwood, are wrapped into pure, fine tannins. Drink now.","Red","Grenache","US",41761
"96465","Green gooseberry, underripe mango and pineapple core notes abound on the nose and continue on into the palate of this easy-drinking white. The mouth is a bit rounder than expected, but brilliant acidity keeps things balanced and lifts the close. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",96465
"14542","Coming from a warm vintage in a hot region, this wine brings light aromas of mineral and red and black fruit along with a barrel-spice top note. The black-cherry flavors are lush, full and palate coating, supported by firm tannins. It's high on the delicious scale.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",14542
"51086","This is a balanced Zinfandel, and it offers elegant acids and burly red and black fruits. It's a structured effort, and it emits a subtle spice character. This will pair well with foods like pizza and pasta.","Red","Zinfandel","US",51086
"52624","Lovely concentration and texture make this a standout and the best wine yet from newcomer Adamant Cellars. Berries and cassis fruit flavors are crisply defined and annotated with smoke and earth; the wine has grip and length.","Red","Red Blend","US",52624
"43620","With its off-dry tango of sweet, tart and mineral components, this is a standout among a large range of Rieslings from Chehalem. Apple and white peach, citrus oil and wet stone are in play, with some grippy tannins adding a taste of orange pekoe tea. The residual sugar, listed at 16 g/L, is off-set with balancing acidity.","White","Riesling","US",43620
"45755","A Cabernet-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend, the Electrum is tannic, dark and earthy. Its cassis fruit is cloaked in rich, dense layers of graphite, espresso and dark chocolate. The density is impressive and suggests that a decade or more in the cellar may prove rewarding.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45755
"43460","Smoky new oak dominates the aromas and flavors of this Pinot Noir, giving a toasty, roasted note. Yet the underlying wine doesn't have the power to support all that wood. Despite the pleasant cherry and raspberry flavors, the oak rules.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",43460
"3891","This wine comes from Alexander Valley-grown Malbec, a variety the producer has been planting in earnest over the last few years. Dark pink-red, it is medium bodied and refreshing, with notes of cherry, blueberry and vanilla.","Red","Malbec","US",3891
"19091","Mainly Grenache (80%, the balance is Syrah) aged entirely in tank, this wine features loads of superripe dark cherries and plums, yet with a savory, olive-and meat-tinged aspect as well. Full-bodied, with a velvety texture and a long finish, it should drink well through at least 2016.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",19091
"48914","This opens with aromas that recall white almond, walnut and graphite. Made with 50% Friulano, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon, the svelte palate offers yellow apple skin, grapefruit, almond and mineral. A hint of lemon drop backs up the finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",48914
"101212","This was aged in equal parts new and used French oak. The new takes the lead with its aromas and flavors of coffee, cocoa and barrel spices out in front of dark fruit. It brings undeniable appeal but the variety seems to get a bit lost.","Red","Malbec","US",101212
"93436","Tantara's 2012 Pinots tend to be cloudy and light like this one, which delivers aromas of cranberry and allspice. It's very soft on the palate, with light chai flavors and the tartness of barely ripe pomegranate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93436
"54917","A tidal wave of toasty char hits like a hammer and dominates the nose. Plump but also jammy and heavy, this tastes oaky, herbal and like candied raspberry, currant and burnt toast. Savory, toasty oak rides high on a finish with residual herbal flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",54917
"22817","Coming from the relatively new but priming Kimsey Vineyard, this shows intoxicatingly rich yet never treacly aromas of ripe cantaloupe, ambrosia melon and peach-apple syrup. Glazed apples, walnut oil and orange bitters decorate the heavily layered and dense palate. Serve it with many varieties of cheese.","White","Roussanne","US",22817
"6756","Yellow freesia and sweet peach abound in this deeply floral, fruity auslese. Feather light in texture, yet deeply concentrated in flavor, it's penetratingly sweet yet finishes with a flurry of crushed minerals and lime-pith astringency.","White","Riesling","Germany",6756
"97697","Herb, red apple, copper penny and dark cherry aromas are followed by sweet, full dark cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, needing some time to soften.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",97697
"99889","Briny cherry and red-currant aromas are light. This feels sharp on the palate, with fresh flavors of red plum, tomato and a salty hint.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",99889
"92431","From western Paso Robles, a dark, full-bodied wine, with ripe, fresh cherries, blackberries, grilled meat and spices. An opulent, fleshy Pinot that finishes a little sweet and jammy, almost like Grenache.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92431
"15797","Inky cool herbal black-fruit aromas set up a choppy tight palate with pounding tannins. Flavors of black coffee and blackberry are heavily toasted. The finish keeps that toasty theme while introducing notes of pepper and horseradish.","Red","Malbec","Uruguay",15797
"54091","Initial scents of cedar, wood-grilled apple, popcorn and orange creamsicle are intensely decadent, promising a lush and textural wine. Those notes carry through to the opulent palate, with supporting accents of orange zest, toasted brioche and hazelnut that unfold on the medium-length finish. Drink now–2016.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",54091
"11847","Cedarville remains an estate producer to follow in the Foothills, melding a well-farmed site with clean, clear winemaking in the cellar. Grown on decomposed granite hillsides, this Syrah has 4% Viognier, just the right touch to bring out the best aromatics, highlighted by sage. Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5–7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet.","Red","Syrah","US",11847
"9153","Medium body and an attractive earthy, oaky flavor profile make this wine a little different from the norm and a great value. It has complexity in the red cherry, rhubarb and sweet-spice flavors, and a supple texture with a touch of tannin.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9153
"61237","There's a pungent or slightly volatile note of fresh cedar or red apple that dominates this wine and leaves little room for the wine's natural complexity to show. This Barolo is also less active in the mouth and tastes older than it really is.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",61237
"64593","This wine is both full of exotic fruits and tightly structured. The combination is fascinating and works, giving a ripe side to the steely core. Its yellow fruit hints that this wine will become rich as it develops. Drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",64593
"38018","For the first time, this release of Buty's Rediviva, from estate vineyards in the Rocks region of Walla Walla, includes a bit of Mourvèdre. The pretty fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, blueberry and black cherry carry both a mineral underpinning and a whiff of the barnyard in the nose. The aging in mostly neutral puncheons and barrels adds just a hint of baking spices.","Red","Red Blend","US",38018
"72628","The nose is broad and welcoming, with apple and pear flesh aromas touched with vanilla and struck match. The palate shows good tension between lemon pith and roasted apple, proving quite focused and grippy with tannins, although a tad hot.","White","Chardonnay","US",72628
"27973","Horsey blackberry and cherry aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is choppy and abrupt. Raw berry flavors finish with a mild sensation of heat.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",27973
"70072","Chipped slate and wet-clay minerality give depth to the baked strawberry, black plum and rose-petal aromas on the nose of this single-vineyard study by Brian Loring. Similar earthiness descends on the palate, with a slow-simmering acidity allowing the juicy black fruit to steadily emerge.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70072
"11388","A special reserve from the producer's vineyard designate of Stagecoach, this wine is layered and full bodied in red licorice and generous oak. Soft, integrated tannins wrap around an herbal underscore that's further cradled in cherry and chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",11388
"57773","A beautifully aged Blanc de Blancs, all toast and almonds in a mineral texture with crisp apple fruit. It is concentrated, deliciously ripe and now soft, ready to drink and likely to continue to age further over several years.","White","Chardonnay","France",57773
"47956","The blue bottle with the banana-colored cork is almost iconic in Oregon. The wine, as always, is far less flashy but perfectly serviceable. It gives fair flavor for your 10 bucks, keeping it simple, sweet and slightly tropical. Don't look for complexity, but if you want a decent, tasting room Riesling, this does the job nicely.","White","Riesling","US",47956
"100463","Peaches and rosewater are the dominant flavors in this tasty, all Grenache rosé. Though it comes across as a bit one dimensional, that dimension has plenty of fruity appeal, supported with lemony acids and a hint of bitter rind.","Red","Grenache","US",100463
"100036","This is a stellar representation of the region, combining ripeness with dark earth and wild herb notes. Aromas of black cherry, crushed slate, turned loam, dried hibiscus and violets make for a lavish nose. The rounded palate weaves black raspberry together with gravel, thyme and sagebrush. Iron fist, silk glove, utterly delicious.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100036
"42590","Winemaker Bruno Corneaux keeps a tight grip on alcohol levels, without sacrificing ripeness, flavor or balance. This aromatically compelling wine jumps up with scents of sea breeze, toasted nuts and buttered popcorn. Flavors follow, with apples, vanilla and toast coming to a full-bodied lingering finish. There's ample length and tension to age gracefully for another decade.","White","Chardonnay","US",42590
"94708","There is a pleasing creaminess to the mouthfeel, yet the wine retains well-defined green apple and citrus fruit flavors. Where many Viogniers are bitter and hot at the finish line, this one is like sucking on a creamsicle.","White","Viognier","US",94708
"54681","From the In The Rocks vineyard, this Rhône white is two thirds Marsanne and one third Viognier, whole cluster fermented in neutral barrels, with no fining or filtering. It's richly textural, aromatic, scented and flavored with lemon verbena, peach, caramel and marzipan. Big and luscious in every way, this is a wine to enjoy while it's in the bloom of youth.","White","White Blend","US",54681
"83176","In cooler vintages like 2007, this white blend from Bodegas Naia excels. It gets going with pear, apple and light, leesy aromas in front of a citrusy palate that is a knock-off for varietal Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and gooseberry should be familiar, and the crisp fresh-lettuce finish is a winner. Good stuff for the money.","White","White Blend","Spain",83176
"60007","While soft on entry with slightly pulpy, sweet plum flavors, this Cab Franc gains intensity on the midpalate as spicy bramble notes and soft tannins accumulate. Approachable in style, it's a pleasant everyday red with just a hint of leafy green on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",60007
"3282","If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.","Red","Syrah","US",3282
"47267","This limited production blend of Arinto and Baga is tight, taut and creamy. Initial intense acidity is balanced by citrus fruits and a lively, bright mousse. The wine has an impressive depth of flavor, richly endowed with fruit, yeastiness and the ability to age further. Drink now, but better from 2018.","Sparkling","Portuguese Sparkling","Portugal",47267
"70120","A slightly powdery, pleasing notion of freshly cut red apple appears first, the palate is of a gossamer lightness, barely there but wonderfully zesty, fresh and clean with some savory overtones. This has the effect of a citrus sorbet and will be balm on a hot day. There's backbone if you care to look for it.","White","Riesling","Austria",70120
"50038","This elegant 50-50 blend of Barbera and Nebbiolo (a popular blending formula for many Langhe red wines) offers the pulpy fruit and acidity of Barbera set against the finesse and menthol-like intensity of Nebbiolo. It's a match made in heaven.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",50038
"13975","This Chardonnay pays homage to the winemaker's wife and business partner, Rae Lee, who unfortunately passed away from breast cancer in 2009. This is an enjoyable showing, displaying lemon and peach tones over a core of creamed corn. Having spent six months in neutral French oak, the palate shows a bit of breadth, balanced by lively acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",13975
"20482","Situated between the two mountain ranges of Saint-Baume and Sainte-Victoire, this estate is dry and relatively cool in the summer. That produces this fresh, lightly pink-colored wine that has a smooth caramel flavor and rich strawberry fruits. The aftertaste is soft and ripe.","Rosé","Rosé","France",20482
"6106","Ripely fruity, with sun-warmed flavors of white peach and nectarine. Acids are fine, and boost the structure. There's also a subtle overlay of oak that adds to the tastes.","White","Chardonnay","US",6106
"16116","While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",16116
"23755","From vines in the eastern section of Saint-Émilion, the Beaumartin family has produced a firmly structured wine that has both fruit and firm tannins. At this stage, the tannins dominate, giving the wine a dry character, but the juicy black-currant fruit is all there. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",23755
"61486","Soft and fruity, this is a ripe style of rosé. It's dry and peppery, with fresh acidity cutting through its rounded texture. It's a rosé for food, with a full aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",61486
"31531","Fantastic modern Chianti! Young but already exuding powerful berry fruit along with loads of cigar box and other attractive spices. The present tense of this wine is all about layered, climbing complexity. Its future is all but ensured, with its tight core, solid wall of tannins and a deep, black cherry finish that lasts a good two minutes.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",31531
"4509","Blended almost equally with Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, and aged in French oak, this white Bordeaux-style wine has plenty to like. It's ripe in Meyer lemons, limes, tropical fruits and peaches, brightened with crisp acidity. Finishes a little lush and ripe.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","US",4509
"51365","For the wine and its fruit, there is too much firm extract here. It brings out very dry tannins and licorice flavors that cover the fruit. It's going to be a difficult wine to soften.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",51365
"95077","Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",95077
"101518","Elegant notes of fresh herb and violet perfume this ripe, richly composed red. While full bodied and densely concentrated with red fruit, it shows restraint and balance, framing luscious fruit against firm, gripping tannins and a brisk, acidic edge.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",101518
"43729","Tough, earthy berry aromas provide a fierce outlook. The palate answers the call, showing syrupy richness amid piercing tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits yield to molasses on the short, stout finish. Tannic and solid, but very sweet. Could it use a bit more balance perhaps?","Red","Red Blend","Spain",43729
"703","Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate.","Red","Syrah","US",703
"52789","A strong hazelnut aroma meets poached pear and cotton candy on the nose of this bottling, giving a rich yet tightly woven impression. The palate is oily in texture, with walnut, dried apricot and browned apple flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",52789

Full and opulent, but elegant and balanced. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",89716
"23531","This is a smooth, light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has red berry fruit tones, with a sweet, lightly tannic character and a juicy, mature aftertaste. It's soft and fruity, with bright acidity at the end.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",23531
"21255","Shooting for wine that will age for at least 15 years, this has too much wood for its own good. Dark and spicy with tough toast, it will likely remain that way. Somebody tried too hard.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",21255
"90064","A beautifully ripe and rounded wood-aged wine. It brings out all the opulence of Meursault while keeping a tight, textured element as counterpoint. The wood flavors are beginning to blend into the lychee and peach flavors, promising an even richer experience in a few months.","White","Chardonnay","France",90064
"38356","From the oldest part of the estate, planted in 1992, this excellent effort seems to have entered the phase where more aromatic complexity appears. It has lovely delineation of both scents and flavors, a matrix of fruit, soil and Pommard clone. Strong streaks of tobacco and chocolate annotate the core of raspberry puree. The concentration and length are impressive.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",38356
"91664","This is a full, ripe wine. It has red fruits, black currants and a rich seam of tannins. There is also a smoky character that adds attraction. With a ripe aftertaste, the wine is developing well and should be ready from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",91664
"32384","Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results. This 2010 is lower in alcohol than the wine has been in a long time, which gives it a delicate mouthfeel. It's dense in cherries, currants, bacon and licorice, but finishes dry. Easy to like for its soft deliciousness.","Red","Tempranillo","US",32384
"104675","Forgoing wood aging, this wine is attractively fruity and crisp. Ripe apple and pear flavors fill out its frame of lemon fruit and bright acidity. Pineapple and white peach notes complete the picture. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",104675

"71734","Rather delicate flavors of green melon, apple and fresh cut grass infuse this elegant Sauvignon Blanc. The precision and balance are impressive; the price and overall lightness make it an excellent, mealtime quaffer.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",71734
"81761","There's a muddled element to the nose here that recalls old wood or spice and in general, this wine lacks sharpness and focus. It tastes very sweet and offers high alcohol that keeps the palate ripping clean.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",81761
"59479","Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon. With barely perceptible residual sugar, the acids keep it lip-smacking and lively. There is just a hint of buttery caramel at the core.","White","Chardonnay","US",59479
"8164","Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025–2050.","White","Pinot Gris","France",8164
"65419","The nose is rich with Red Delicious apple notes. The palate adds lemon freshness and a tangy, slightly bitter but appetizing streak of zestiness. The finish is restrained, just dry and clean.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",65419
"55165","Threads of dark char, nuts and spice meander throughout this rich, deeply concentrated Bordeaux-style blend. Plump black cherry and cassis flavors are luscious on the palate, but invigorated by a bright flash of acidity and spice on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",55165
"17430","A blend of Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this offers aromas recalling red currant, blue flower, espresso and a whiff of baking spice. On the soft, accessible palate, notes of sage and toast accent a core of dried cherry. Drink through 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",17430
"14465","Deep and dark blueberry aromas are laced with blackberry-balsamic reduction, black tobacco, black sage and a brooding spice character on this blend of 71% Syrah, 24% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre. It's thick and chewy on the palate, with ripe purple fruits clinging to a dense backbone of bacon fat and fudge.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",14465
"94836","Earthy, dense, smoky and charred, this Pinot is showing clear signs of coming from a warm year. Tomatoey acidity and a leathery quality drive the palate, while flavors of stewed, briny raspberry and plum are leathery and finish savory and slightly salty.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",94836
"55174","Nicely textured and balanced, this white from a cooler subsection of the larger Napa Valley is more austere than not, a taste of lemon and licorice combining in a medium-bodied package of refreshment. The mouthfeel works consistently from start to finish, the end note smooth and swift.","White","Chardonnay","US",55174

"85891","This bottling from an iconic vineyard is subtle yet steady on the nose, with cinnamon and nutmeg spice giving character to a red-cherry base. The vibrant palate keeps the mouth watering, showing clove and more nutmeg atop sharper cranberry and warmer cherry fruit tones.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85891
"14698","This 100% varietal wine seems to still be in its shell, with light notes of coffee, plum and licorice along with other barrel spices. The fruit flavors are supple with some heft to the tannins and a tart lick of acidity that spruces things up. A lot of good things are going on here but they don't quite all come together.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",14698

"11020","Attractive lemon-flavored citrus character with light acidity. This is a classic, creamy wine with a fresh aftertaste. A drink now wine. Screw cap.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",11020
"29757","Apart from an obvious emphasis on oak-related aromas of vanilla, spice and carpentry shop, this is a satisfying Rosso that would pair with roast chicken, potatoes, garlic and rosemary. The garlic and rosemary would take the edge off those wood tones.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",29757
"75290","With ripe cherry-berry and tobacco-spice flavors, this is a bit hot in alcohol and rustic in astringent tannins. But give it the right greasy food, such as barbecue ribs, and it will rise to the occasion.","Red","Zinfandel","US",75290

"20693","They grow powerful grapes in parts of Amador County and this one stands out for its elevated alcohol. The mix of 70% Zinfandel and smaller helpings of Mourvèdre, Barbera, Syrah and Touriga combine for a spicy cola taste. Leathery notes and big tannins linger long on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",20693
"13819","Aromas of French oak, vanilla, coconut and a funky trace of barnyard dominate the nose. The muddled, rather rustic palate shows overripe black cherry, glazed plum, game, sweet and sour sauce and a note of bitter walnut. Dusty tannins give it a drying, fleeting finish.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",13819
"60367","This cru wine is still young and firm. It has great tannins and a dense character that will give a rich generous wine as it matures. Black-cherry fruit dominates along with the structure. It is a solid wine that will be ready to drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",60367
"59148","This vineyard designate Barbaresco delivers elegant mineral tones and pretty accents of chopped herbs, black fruit, forest floor, bramble and licorice. “Elegance” is the key word here and the wine finishes with soft tannins and impressive staying power.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",59148
"32675","Super-fruity, a real orchard, with pineapples, apples, Meyer lemons and even something tropical, like mango. In fact, a little too sweet, almost cloying on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",32675

Forest floor and a touch of smoke complement juicy dark cherry, caramelized oak and licorice, while bright acidity supports the layers of flavor and strong tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88161
"13021","A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential. Black pepper and crisp orange and pomegranate flavors show through its layered and focused texture—a savory package with a seemingly endless finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",13021
"93844","This Shiraz spends 13 months in French and American oak, and it shows, thanks to decadent notes of chocolate-covered cherry, cocoa powder and tree bark. The palate exhibits a bit more fruitiness, with flavors of red plum and cherry flesh. A hint of white pepper stays through the medium-length close.","Red","Shiraz","Israel",93844
"32878","Tightly wound on the nose, this wine eventually releases blackcurrant and blueberry fruit along with aromas of black rock and turned earth. The palate is dense with black peppercorn, char and asphalt, lifted by hints of violet. Since the structure is dense and tannic, it will be fun to watch this wine emerge over the years.","Red","Syrah","US",32878
"18336","Plenty of dry Malbec tannins here. In fact, this verges on the austere, piling high on to the fruit. There is density, those tannins going right through the wine, finishing with acidity. Tough at this stage: give it 2–3 years.","Red","Malbec","France",18336
"1566","Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",1566
"106043","This is Corley's first Pinot Noir since 1999 and it's delicious. Grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District, it shows Pinot's opulent side, with a silky, velvety texture framing ripe cherry pie, red currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors. Best now through 2010.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",106043

"93519","Fruity and big-boned, this opens well with pleasant plum and cherry flavors. It doesn't quite hold together, turning sour and leaving an off-taste in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93519
"54173","Very soft, not quite dry, this red wine is ripe and full. It has a gentle structure with some stalky black fruits and ripe tannins. It's very ready to drink.","Red","Red Blend","France",54173

"47553","An attractive, rich and creamy Chardonnay, this balances acidity with  tropical fruit and wood flavors. Made using fruit from a parcel in the Haute-Serre Vineyard, this is a wine that has an edge of minerality as well as ripe, textured fruit.","White","Chardonnay","France",47553
"66351","Braide Alte is a beautiful blend of Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Picolit and Moscato Giallo (some of the main white grapes used in northern Italy) that shows sophisticated tones of stone fruit, melon, cinnamon spice and white almond. In the mouth, the wine shows length and luscious persistency.","White","White Blend","Italy",66351
"87336","Spicy and peppery, with lots of body and richness. In a word, it's true Carmenère. The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness. The finish is tight and long, with some espresso flavor. If you're interested in trying a well-made Carmenère, give this a go.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",87336
"46051","Dusty spice notes of ginger and cinnamon accent ripe pear and muskmelon fruit on the nose. This is rich and off-dry in style, with a round, mouthfilling presence on the palate balanced by bright acidity and a lingering note of white pepper.","White","Pinot Gris","New Zealand",46051

"44642","Deep black plum, clove, dried blueberry, dried roses and dried violets show on the very nice nose of this bottling by Bruce McGuire and pioneer Pierre Lafond. It's well structured on the sip, disclosing plums, sweet berries and touches of nutmeg and allspice. It's a strong showing for one of their more affordable bottlings.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",44642
"73083","A lusty young Pinot that shows an immature mouthfeel in the vibrantly hard tannins, juicy coastal acidity and jammy red cherry and currant flavors that have not yet wedded to the oak. It would be a shame to open this wine before the end of 2010, although most people will.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73083
"12486","Shannon Ridge is quietly becoming the king of Lake County, offering wines of both quality and value and this is no exception. This blend is made of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. The kitchen-sink approach doesn't muddle the wine in any way; it remains a smooth, fruity, ripe quaff, with a kick of vanilla on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",12486
"18503","Smooth and creamy, this is a rounded wine that's soft in texture. A good bite of lemon juice acidity adds balance and attractive fruitiness. Finishes very clean and fragrant. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",18503
"20681","Marked by bright acidity and jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, this Pinot is nicely silky, but a bit one-dimensional. It has a long, spicy finish. Drink over the next 2–3 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20681

"71229","These grapes are sourced from the relatively cooler region of Orange, and it shows in the wine's pear and citrus flavors. Hints of nuts (cashews, perhaps?) add complexity and style not often found in this price range. Crisp and clean on the finish, with refreshing citrus notes.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",71229
"86638","This shows both the fruit of the vintage and a more structured tannic side. Black currant flavors are up front, offering a generous feeling. They are balanced by the backdrop of tannins and tight acidity. Together they make a wine that is concentrated and likely to be ready to drink soon.

"78339","Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer.","White","Chardonnay","US",78339
"14135","A little extra bottle age has helped this wine soften up, but it still seems to stop a bit short. The entry is firm and shows some Oregon herbal character, along with tart, wild berry and light baking spices. There is a vague hint of barnyard as well. The tannins are beginning to smooth out, and this can probably benefit from a few more years in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14135
"78686","Soft and smooth, this barrel-fermented wine remains fruit-driven. The barrel time seems to have rounded it off, rather than adding any noticeable toast. Pleasant flavors of apple sauce carry a hint of spice.","White","Chardonnay","US",78686
"7842","This mouthwatering blend starts with a nose of fresh mint, pineapple and mango, followed by flavors of orange peel, peach and lemon. Fresh and fruity with a mineral backbone, the wine finishes on an earthy spin. Pair with grilled sardines or poultry dishes.","White","White Blend","",7842
"8949","This wine gets neutral French oak and it shows in its zesty profile of orange and tangerine over apple and pear. The fruit is hearty and juicy, the texture light and refreshing.","White","Chardonnay","US",8949
"22212","Yellow in color and heavy on the nose, this smells mostly of match stick and sulfur. On the palate, this is scattered, with no point of reference. Heavy, chunky flavors of nectarine, citrus pith and almond skin finish oily and bitter.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",22212
"33217","While full bodied and plush, this vineyard-designate, named for original owner Judy Jordan's daughter, brightens the palate with cranberry and rhubarb. It shows high acidity and a leanness of texture that makes the wine seem lighter than it is, a nice mix of power and grace with a lingering hit of spice on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33217
"93441","Made in small quantities, this Pinot is light in color and gorgeously rendered in earthy, forested notes of Bing cherry and strawberry. Lean and buoyant in acidity, it was given 30% new oak, providing subtle depth and complexity without masking the wine's balance of fruit and earth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93441

"34618","An aroma like fresh-baked bread and flavors like tart apple and nutmeg mean this medium-bodied wine is subtle in a good way, and has a bright mouth-feel. The Jack on the label is golfer Nicklaus, for whom this wine was bottled.","White","Chardonnay","US",34618
"3414","Produced from a field blend of Douro varieties, and foot trodden in open granite fermenters, this is a wine that has an excellent future. It also has such delicious juicy black fruits that it could be drunk soon. Ideally, though, keep this ripe sweet wine until 2026.","Port","Port","Portugal",3414

"90186","This is firm, dusty and seemingly built for the cellar. Toasty, cedary and chocolaty oak frames dark fruit, yet it remains fresh in character, not dried or overripe. The finish is long, tannic and reminiscent of fine Bordeaux. Try after 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",90186
"32223","The nose of this bottling is both floral and savory, blending roasted beef with lilacs and a creamy boysenberry mousse. The palate is cohesive and pleasant, with dark berries, a touch of roasted game and more purple-flower petals, carried by a persistent acidity.","Red","Syrah","US",32223
"37178","Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah take the lead on this blend. Aromas of wood spice, café au lait, cherry and spice box are followed by tobacco and cherry flavors. There are good things going on but the wood gets a bit out front.","Red","Red Blend","US",37178
"83651","Acidic, chalky and sharp upon entry, this wine's light berry flavors quickly give way to those tart acids. Though the fruit shows some concentration, it's a one-dimensional effort that has not completely knit together.","Red","Grenache","US",83651
"20318","This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",20318
"62220","This wine is nearly dry—increasingly rare for NZ Pinot Gris—with aromas of slightly stewed fruit: white grapes and pears with sprinklings of clove and cinnamon. It's only medium weight, with a finish reminiscent of canned pears and a hint of tangerine. Drink now.","White","Pinot Gris","New Zealand",62220
"2453","Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.","White","Chardonnay","US",2453

"18215","Aromas of espresso, black pepper, oak, chocolate and blackberry jam waft out of the glass. The dense, concentrated palate delivers brandied black cherry, licorice, raisin and coffee alongside firm, gripping tannins that leave the palate dry on the finish. Give the tannins another two or three years to unwind and then enjoy.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",18215
"9991","Mourvèdre (39%) takes the lead, followed by Grenache (36%), Syrah and Cinsault.

It's fruit forward and flavorful with a fine sense of balance and an undeniable, warm vintage appeal.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",9991
"62787","This is fragrant and varietally-correct on the nose. Quince, lemon-lime and lychee flavors show their best right away before turning decidedly sweet on the finish.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",62787
"5313","Big and fruity, this is very lively, balancing butteriness with green-fruit acidity. The wine is maturing quickly, its tension is fading into rich, wood-flavored fruitiness.","White","Chardonnay","France",5313
"35737","Produced by the owners of Châteauneuf-du-Pape estate Château Mont-Redon, this is a full and fruity wine. It has a good balance between acidity and red berry fruits that give a rich character. Packed with flavor, it's ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",35737
"28634","Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",28634
"59701","A light, refreshing and yet complex combination of fresh-cut grapefruit and watermelon, a suggestion of apricot and cranberry in the wings, this wine is stellar in every way. Fermented in both stainless steel and neutral oak it provides a textured acidity that gives it balance and just enough weight, finishing with a taste of wet stone.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59701
"97126","Well made and balanced, this wine is full of red-currant and berry fruits plus layers of tannins. Structured and with a smoky character, it is fresh, fruity and will develop quickly. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",97126
"105854","Smoky wood makes its presence known. This wine has a soft, rounded texture and a warm, rich feel. There's attractive citrus and apricot fruit to go with the wood spice.","White","Chardonnay","France",105854
"74910","This winery's Walla Walla Valley debut displays aromas of ash, green olive, grilled asparagus, dried flowers, smoked meat and blue fruit. The smoke and savory flavors are soft and reserved in style, showing a pleasing persistence on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",74910
"48197","This delicious, refreshing wine is textured, tight and mineral, with fruity acidity. Tangy and crisp, it has a tight structure, touches of toast along with apple and citrus flavors. The wine is still young and very tight, so should not be drunk before 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",48197
"34689","This is so smooth, rich and mellow, you hardly notice how intense the tannins are. But they are hard, and lock down the flavors of black currant and black licorice, plus the complex notes of minerals, roasted game and dark spices. Drink this Malbec-based blend now after decanting and over the next six years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",34689
"79548","Wood aromas and spice show strongly in this wine. On the palate, there is a toasty character that gives a bitter edge to the ripe red fruits. That needs to go, so wait to drink this wine from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",79548
"19891","A dark, deep-colored Syrah that's dusty and austere but delicious, a good representation of the variety's ability to be both ripe and complex in California.","Red","Syrah","US",19891
"27621","One of the labels from the Bonnet vineyard of André Lurton, this red follows the approachable, fruity style of these wines. Red berry fruits and soft tannins make it already drinkable.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",27621
"69279","This is a mouthfilling wine that doesn't go over the top in terms of ripeness or tannins, so it's smooth to drink and offers mild plum and cherry flavors.","Red","Red Blend","US",69279
"97573","With its tannins, this is initially a firm wine, but then ripe berry fruits emerge, followed by great acidity and freshness.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",97573
"95040","Elegantly layered on the nose, this region-showcasing project presents baked plums, pure black-cherry extract and mulberry alongside nutmeg and clove spice. The palate offers a steady evolution of savory flavors, from black cherry and exotically spiced berries to espresso bean, garam masala, plum rinds, peppercorn and allspice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95040
"62079","Familiar Cab Franc aromas of dry spice, green herbs, fennel and pepperoni feed into a narrow palate that's high in acidity and drawing. Spiky tomato, plum, herb and pepper flavors finish dry and pulling, with a saucy aftertaste.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Argentina",62079
"47791","Sanguis combines its signature of exceptional power with finesse, producing a wine that is so dramatic as to defy belief. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon provide the blackberry jam and chocolate richness, while Viognier brings a bright floral note, and even Roussanne has something to say by way of orange tartness. New oak is evident, but perfectly in balance with the wine's volume. Stunning and dramatic, but not an ager, so drink up.","Red","Red Blend","US",47791
"97942","While this Tempranillo is straightforward in style, it does have some good cherry, herb tea and cola flavors. It's rich and soft, but has a pleasant burst of acidity.","Red","Tempranillo","US",97942
"75763","Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",75763
"98617","Tight, grippy tannin complements sharp acidity in this youthful wine from a rich vintage and mountainous appellation. Rich, red fruit yields to more savory currant aspects, dusted in clove spice and rooted in full-bodied weightiness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",98617
"29178","Aromas of dark berry, menthol, crushed violet, mint and pipe tobacco open this elegant expression of Nebbiolo. The palate offers black cherry, ripe raspberry, orange peel, cinnamon, mineral and herb alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It closes on a mint note. Drink 2015–2021.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",29178
"56801","Very rich and ripe, marked by pure, intense flavors of cherries, blueberries and spicy cloves. It displays the balanced elegance and thoughtful winemaking of this winery. Young and juicy now, it should develop in the bottle for a year or two, but some sharpness in the finish will ultimately limit ageability.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56801
"31220","This wine comes from three-year-old vines at this esteemed vineyard. Lighter in color, it has aromas that pop and are very primary, with notes of boysenberry, raspberry and herb. Lighter in style, the flavors are pure and direct, showing no new oak influence (neutral barrels for four months) and an appealing feel. The purity is dazzling. It impresses on its own but is meant to be shown at the dinner table.","Red","Syrah","US",31220
"65347","The winery's Édition Limitée is a block selection, ripe, rich and beautifully rounded out. It's totally full bodied without becoming jammy, a lush compote of berries, cherries, citrus oil and refined acids that conjure up ripe pineapple juice. A long, lightly smoky finish seems to go on for endless minutes. Drink now through 2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",65347
"52172","Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",52172
"19061","From an estate-farmed vineyard, this medium-bodied wine is earthy and aromatic in baked bread, with soft, moderate acidity. With length and breadth, it shows a tartness of black tea and stems, finishing in oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19061
"61314","Delicious is the first word that pops into your head when you taste this wine. It's got the sort of sweet fruit that you find in Russian River Pinots, yet retains the definition and refinement, along with a slight herbal nuance, that speaks of the Willamette Valley. Long in the mouth and tangy with a mix of spice and fruit sweetness in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",61314
"103317","A tiny percentage of Barbera grapes accounts for why this famous wine is not labeled as a Barolo. The Nebbiolo is sourced from the Cerequio Cru and offers long aromas of dried fruit, licorice, tar, tobacco, bitter chocolate and cola. The finish is extremely fine and polished. Drink after 2025.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",103317
"66542","Lime pith, green plum and white clover aromas lead the nose of this Sauv Blanc, and the mouth offers similarly tart and tight flavors. The short finish favors white grapefruit accented by green grass.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Israel",66542
"6012","Sweet and simple, with jellied blackberry and cherry flavors, harsh tannins and a sugary finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",6012
"35498","Smoothly textured with a hint of viscosity, this shows typical apple and hay flavors. Consistent from nose to close, there's nothing wrong here, but it lacks the liveliness a vibrant young Verdejo can show. Drink now. —M.M.","White","Verdejo","Spain",35498
"63435","Tart, citrusy acidity backs up cranberry, pomegranate and spice flavors in this dry, silky young Pinot Noir. It's somewhat brusque right out of the bottle, so give it a brief decant before pouring.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63435
"58919","The nose is subdued, with aromas of crisp red plum, herb and bramble; but the palate is lush, with loads of ripe strawberry, peach and cherry flavors. This is dry in style but soft and juicy on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58919
"49684","This proffers a very clean-cut nose with a hauntingly precise notion of Williams pear. The lovely, slender palate features some midpalate texture and delicate lemon and pear notes finishing with a warm aftertaste of alcoholic power.","White","Pinot Blanc","Austria",49684
"43238","Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",43238
"26513","Made from Pinot Noir vinified like a white wine, this fruity, fresh wine is a shade off dry. On the palate, hints of cherry and blossom, accent zesty grapefruit and lemon flavors. The finish is refreshingly dry. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",26513
"7724","Powerful in pungent gooseberry flavors, this wine will appeal to aficionados of New Zealand Sauvignons, but will leave those craving riper, lusher fruit flavors out in the cold. The acidity is very high, almost making the wine what the French call pétillant, or fizzy.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",7724
"21588","A note of waxy honeycomb glazes the nose and palate of this lusciously ripe dry Riesling. Its rich almost oily mouthfeel is deeply satisfying, but balanced keenly with spurts of bright white grapefruit and lemon zest. Its finish is long and penetrating, marked by complexities of saffron and pollen.","White","Riesling","Germany",21588
"79765","Fragrant, with a floral lift in the nose, this is loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and citrus. A whiff of toast and just-sawn wood leads into a lengthy, beautifully balanced, tongue-coating finish.","White","Chardonnay","Canada",79765
"106260","This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",106260
"103502","Red fruits are what drive this easy, fragrant wine. The tannins play a supporting role, which gives the berry flavors structure. A blend from two Douro estates, this attractive selection will be ready to drink in a year.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",103502
"88595","The chalky soil yields a crisp, textured wine with yellow fruits to round it out. There is a steely edge and just a touch of wood, while the aftertaste is packed with acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",88595
"98400","Young and tight, this requires aggressive aeration before it begins to show much flavor. It's worth the effort, as it evolves into a dense, delicious wine that marries its juicy stone fruits to a rich mix of vanilla, coconut and caramel components from the barrel aging. Drink 2018 to 2030.","White","Chardonnay","US",98400
"1297","A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1297
"57357","The aromas are watery and very faint, suggestive of kiwi, lime and vanilla. Flavors are similarly very light. What the palate gives is alcohol, acidity and sugar, with just the barest trace of citrus.","White","Chenin Blanc","US",57357
"58752","This pure, supple, fruit-laden Syrah is loaded with wild blackberry fruit, and detailed veins of licorice, coffee, and iron filings. The wine's excellent length and polished tannins showcase exceptional handling of superb fruit.","Red","Syrah","US",58752
"80845","Chuck Reininger sources the fruit for this wine from what is arguably the best site in the Walla Walla Valley. The wine does not shy away from the herbal aspect for which Carmenère is known, but the stemminess is mitigated thanks to the influence of new French oak. A cherry candy note consolidates the flavors on the medium-long finish.","Red","Carmenère","US",80845
"86097","Sharp acidity underscores light, quite tart cranberry fruit. This has herbal notes in abundance, and an earthy note to the tannins. But it all comes together with a clean, polished finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86097
"39725","A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",39725
"25638","Dark colored wine, which translates into richness and flavors of full-bodied damsons and plum fruits, with finely judged tannins and wood. Natural power, with concentration and final acidity to give just the right lift.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",25638
"21630","This Garnacha's leathery, slightly underripe aromas are more savory than bold and fruity. On the palate, it's dry, with tomato-like acidity, fresh and zesty roasted plum flavors and a medicinal note that lingers on the finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",21630
"81649","Grassy, minty aromas, a juicy texture and tart cherry flavors add up to a medium-bodied, uncomplicated wine with good balance.","Red","Red Blend","US",81649
"43389","A beautifully exuberant mountain Zin. There's nothing shy or reserved about its power blast of wild briary berries, currants, chocolate and peppery spice flavors. Deliciously complex and distinctly Zinny.","Red","Zinfandel","US",43389
"49816","This is a fairly dense and rich wine given the price. The nose deals raisin, plum and cherry aromas in front of a loaded, chewy palate with earthy, slightly flat berry and rubbery flavors that are accompanied by low-level acidity. Don't wait long to drink this generous value wine.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",49816
"75788","Just what many people like, an oaky, ripe, sweet Chardonnay, but purists will find it simple and pandering to public taste.","White","Chardonnay","US",75788
"68522","As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.","White","Chardonnay","US",68522
"90347","This is Pinot Noir at its lightest, reminiscent of a German Blauburgunder. Delicate, just-ripe flavors suggest rhubarb and wild raspberry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90347
"95084","This opens with a whiff of green and clam shell but quickly transitions to black plum and berry scents. Tannic and rugged on the palate, it has a mix of blackberry, chocolate and herbal flavors. The finish is firm, with length and more than enough power.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",95084
"25405","Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.","White","Albariño","Spain",25405
"29205","This blend of 35% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Petite Sirah is actually a party of three, but the results are solid. Chocolate, black cherries, scarlet rose buds and toasted oak pop on the nose. The smooth and dense palate shows boysenberry, black pepper and a chalky tannic structure.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",29205
"69381","The opening of tobacco, lemon peel, floral notes and mixed black fruits is alluring, while the palate is crisp and acidic but still fresh and good. Herbal berry fruit flavors with citric hints work the flavor profile, and the finish smacks down with firm tannins and bite. Nice aromas and flavors but the mouthfeel needs some work. 55% Carmenère with 30% Syrah and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",69381
"12461","There's a lot to love on this juicy, delicious wine, starting with aromas of ripe, dark-skinned berry, baking spice, leather, sun baked soil and menthol. The elegant, structured palate delivers ripe black cherry, cinnamon, anise and tobacco while firm, polished tannins provide support and finesse. A blast of orange zest signals the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",12461
"97367","Gritty plum and currant aromas are basic but fresh. Ditto the palate, which shows acidic scratch but not too much. Prickly lightly oaked cherry and plum flavors end with scratchy freshness, lean tannins and lasting berry notes.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",97367
"20541","RPF is regularly one of Uruguay's better Tannats, although this vintage smells a lot like tar. A highly tannic palate is rugged and drying, while gritty roasted berry flavors finish rough and rugged, with spicy afternotes.","Red","Tannat","Uruguay",20541
"78288","Seductive perfume suggest fronds of jasmine, ivy, mandarin and perhaps an edge of pink grapefruit. The playfulness of this citrus feast fizzes away and excites both nose and palate. It has all the effortlessness that comes with years of practice.","White","Riesling","Austria",78288
"42556","This wine might knock your socks off with massively rich, ripe flavors of cherry pie, blueberry jam, mocha and toasty oak, wrapped into ultra-smooth tannins. For all the richness, it's brightened with just enough acidity for balance and finishes dry. There's no reason not to drink it now. Production was only 96 cases, but it's worth a search.","Red","Merlot","US",42556
"48143","This fresh-smelling wine blends aromas of caramel apple and light grapefruit juice. The palate is racy in acidity, like a glass of fresh orange juice splashed with squeezes of lemon and grapefruit, and a vanilla warmth toward the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",48143
"99510","A little dark and heavy for a rosé, with jammy flavors of raspberries, vanilla and brown sugar. It sure is tasty, however, especially with prosciutto, melons and figs.","Red","Sangiovese","US",99510
"105455","From one of the major estates in Pessac-Léognan, this is a fine, stylish and tightly structured wine. It has spice and intense acidity to balance the dark tannins and black-currant fruit. It is going to need several years to really mature. The estate is owned by André Lurton who was influential in creating the Pessac-Léognan appellation. Drink from 2024.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",105455
"10222","This wine has a nose of black fruits, mocha and toffee, and on the palate, warming spices, tart cherry and a touch of sweetness. The flavors aren't overly complex, but the wine is appealing, and the finish lingering.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",10222
"78477","The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",78477
"47281","This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",47281
"103003","Mainly Chardonnay, with the rest Pinot Noir, this brut is forward in oranges, vanilla and yeast, with hints of raspberries. The finish clearly shows the sugary dosage. Seems like it wants time in the bottle to let all the parts knit, so give it until 2018 to see what it's doing.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",103003
"30426","Aromas of plum and wood spice lead to plentiful blue-fruit flavors that show a fine sense of purity. The tannins provide a dry, lightly astringent squeeze.","Red","Malbec","US",30426
"90326","Made exclusively from Sangiovese, Cipresso is a lively, brilliant red with pretty fruit intensity and a solid, bright finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",90326
"66148","This is ripe, round and lush. Cherry-scented goodness leads the way, accented by hints of cracked pepper, cinnamon and allspice that linger elegantly on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",66148
"86068","Intense floral scents of freshly cut roses and wild violets jump out of the glass. On the palate, dark cherry and crushed cherry twine with allspice, cinnamon, clove, leather and alpine herbs. All are partnered by assertive but supple tannins and fresh acidity. Best 2015–2030.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",86068
"73532","The first of the vintage to be tasted from the region, this bottling is a promising sign. Fresh-cut green apples, Anjou pear skins, honeydew, bubblegum, wet stone and whiffs of cut grass show on the nose. There's lots of verve to the palate, with white pepper, apple skin and slight jalapeño flavors. It's perfect for shellfish and salads.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",73532
"103166","A blend relying on 70% Cabernet Franc with the remainder an equal split of Malbec and Merlot, this offers a lot of raspberry tart and caramel, along with a tropical element of coconut. Softened tannins and mellow oak combine to good effect, before an abbreviated finish of vanilla.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",103166
"89751","A zesty nose promises refreshment and poise. The palate not only keeps this promise but tops it. Orange, mandarin and lemon frame riper peach and Mirabelle plum explode like a firework of fruit on the palate. This is fruit-framed, citrus-focused joy, combining immense concentration with immense elegance. There is a long and exciting life ahead of this.","White","Riesling","Austria",89751
"77698","Complex and tantalizing aromas of mint and cinnamon carry over to the palate, where bright plum, red cherry and floral tones linger through the finish. The texture is very smooth since the tannins and acidity are mild and well integrated.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",77698
"91743","Basically a dessert wine because it jumps beyond the off-dry line into overtly sweet. Shows pastry-filling flavors of apricots and pineapples, with rich vanilla and smoky honey overtones.","White","Riesling","US",91743
"27848","This opens hot and heavy, with pounding berry aromas and a touch of animal fur. The palate is full and compact, with jammy, syrupy berry and woodspice flavors. A long finish tastes of licorice and oak.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",27848
"10004","Harsh and dry in tannins and acids, with weedy flavors of cherries, herbs and mint. Has a nice, silky texture, but not going anywhere.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",10004
"22272","Hints of cut grass and passion fruit on the nose are followed by attractive tropical fruit and fresh herbs on the palate. This medium-bodied wine boasts a soft, rounded feel that turns slightly chalky on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",22272
"76303","Named after César the sculptor and not Caesar the Roman emperor, the wine has a strongly herbal character that seems to come from the superripe fruit as well as the landscape around Monte Sainte-Victoire. It is certainly rich, although the acidity balances out the spice and pepper character. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",76303
"70645","This grassy North Coast offering has plenty of lime, kiwi and jalapeño flavors that are able to stand up to spicy appetizers with its crisp, long finish. Proceeds are donated to the restoration of watersheds for steelhead trout and coho salmon.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",70645
"43934","This is a fine Chardonnay that's brisk with acidity and dry, yet rich with flavors of tropical fruits, green apples, hazelnuts and toasty oak. There's also a minerality that extends the finish beautifully. You might want to give it a year or two in the cellar. The grapes are from Marimar Torres's esteemed Don Miguel Vineyard.","White","Chardonnay","US",43934
"78909","This is the most expensive of Coelho's three Pinot Gris offerings and also the least ripe. Bone-dry, sour and thin, it seems to improve when paired with fresh oysters.","White","Pinot Gris","US",78909
"94060","Owned by the Francisco family since 1870, this wine is juicy and just lightly stalky, with fine crisp acidity. Needing to develop and soften its firm texture, it will be ready to drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",94060
"87412","Aromas include black berries, coffee, espresso and grilled Mediterranean herbs. The one-dimensional palate lacks the essential fruit richness needed to support the bracing, astringent tannins that give a drying, bitter character. It also displays evident alcohol sensations despite the modest alcohol.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",87412
"27253","This intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdelho is surprisingly effective. It benefits from the ripe, perfumed character of the Verdelho which dominates the palate. There is background freshness given by the Sauvignon. It's a ripe, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",27253
"59026","Honeyed ripe pear fruit fills the nose. The palate amplifies this rich notion even more with a generous touch of residual sweetness that bathes the pear fruit in caramel richness. There is a glint of pleasant phenolic bitterness here and there but the pear fruit conquers all. This is rich but fresh with a medium-sweet finish ideal for blue cheese.","White","Pinot Gris","France",59026
"91423","The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend of this structured wine gives strong tannins and tight black currant fruit at this young stage. It has good potential, however, a solid and powerful wine that needs several years. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",91423
"2691","This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry.","Red","Merlot","US",2691
"17579","Roasted berry and spent coffee aromas blend with leathery notes that suggest animal. This wine feels solid but rough and grabby. Savory plum and berry flavors finish with a note of baking spices.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",17579
"4068","Hot and scoury in high alcohol, and that burn is accented by Zin's powerhouse tingly spices. The flavors are extracted and sweet in raspberries, cherries and milk chocolate. Enjoy this rugged Zin with barbecue and roasts.","Red","Zinfandel","US",4068
"49530","Gritty, tarry aromas of black olive and raspberry lead to a hard palate with choppy acidity. Sizzling plum and currant flavors come with a burnt note, while a long finish is bolstered by preserving acidity. This is a patented Chilean Cab: expect a heavy herbal character centered around olive and eucalyptus.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",49530
"24578","Fresh and fruity with creamy green and white fruits, this is a soft, ready to drink Chardonnay. Attractively fruity, the acidity finely cuts through the wine.","White","Chardonnay","France",24578
"5644","Opening aromas blend earthy red fruits with a whiff of leather. It's a nicely sculpted wine, tight and stiff, with pleasant berry and cherry flavors that stop abruptly as the finish turns a bit sour.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5644
"90349","This bottling is classic in its ample, smoky marshmallow, campfire and jam sandwich flavors. The palate is laced with notes of red licorice and vanilla.","Red","Zinfandel","US",90349
"1042","Soft and sweet, this Pinot has simple but appealing raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. It would score higher if the texture was more potent.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1042
"23341","Smells like tobacco and pepper, and then turns tannic and dry in the mouth, with blackberry flavors emerging after it warms up. A decent everyday Zin.","Red","Zinfandel","US",23341
"99669","Hints of smoke and white peach mark the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's a touch less expressive on the palate, but pleasantly plump, with great focus and length on the finish. Drink now–2016.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",99669
"84367","Fresh pear and lively yeast, peppery watercress and fresh citrus create a lively, appetizing nose. The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core. This is still very young but so ready and utterly irresistible, yet with the mileage to age. Don't drink too quickly—you'll miss the chance of savoring the peppery aftertaste.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",84367
"19706","A blend of fruit from up-and-coming Red Heaven and Scooteney Flats vineyards, this wine brings aromas of game, medicine cabinet and cherry. The fruit flavors are soft in feel, seeming somewhat dried out.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",19706
"71315","Rooty, earthy berry aromas include a hint of clove. This feels full and chewy, with broad shoulders and firm tannins. Herbal blackberry flavors come with tea and spice notes. It is stocky and woody on a finish that tastes like campfire smoke.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",71315
"64184","Classic aromas of baked cherry and clove spice meet with the slightest tangy touch of dried orange on the nose of this appellation blend. The baking-spice character consumes the palate, where rich black cherry and tart ripe cranberry decorate the meaty mouthfeel, all framed by boisterous mouthwatering acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64184
"27779","Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",27779
"88507","With a taste of fresh blueberry cobbler and pie crust, this well-made wine is from the producer's mountainous estate. Powerful yet soft, it offers further concentrated flavors of cinnamon, clove and smoke, with just a touch of violet on the nose.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",88507
"48211","Barrel-fermented, this Sauvignon Blanc has a rich, creamy mouthfeel. Smoky notes of vanilla and sweet oak frame flavors of lemons and limes, figs, pineapples and cinnamon sugar.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",48211
"44928","First you feel the velvety softness of this Cab. Then the flavors arrive, explosive in blackberries, cherries and currants, green olives, sage, cocoa and oak. Immediately the tannins close in, astringent, dry, hard. The bottom line is an extraordinary wine but one that's not drinkable now. Hold until 2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44928
"66742","This plump, medium-bodied rosé features aromas of nectarine and citrus, followed up by flavors of stone fruit, perhaps a hint of cherry and a bit of white chocolate. Then it tightens up again on the finish, turning more citrusy again.","Rosé","Rosé","France",66742
"41531","Rather austere whiffs of lemon, lime and pine on the nose of this medium-sweet Spätlese belie the fruity mélange of grapefruit and guava that awaits on the palate. It's dainty in mouthfeel, yet buoyant and penetrating in sweet citrus, honey and melon flavors. The finish draws out dramatically, meandering on a murmur of tea tannins.","White","Riesling","Germany",41531
"12391","If you had the resources to analyze what makes a picture postcard-perfect Russian River Pinot Noir, and then to actually produce it in case quantities, this is what you'd come up with. The wine is dry and silky and crisply acidic, with pleasant cherry, root beer and spice flavors. It's as friendly as can be and fully ready now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12391
"59601","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with aromas of cherry liqueur and cassis, followed by accents of leather and toasted nut. The palate is tight and fresh, and it offers touches of citrus and forest fruit.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",59601
"36026","A big wine bursting with the wildest of brambly berry flavors, and a peppery, herbal hint of earth and wood. The tannins are smooth and dusty. It's a nice bit of winemaking, but a little too big and uncontrolled for its britches. —S.H.","Red","Zinfandel","US",36026
"98936","Balsamic notes of menthol and crushed mint mingle with dark culinary spice, coffee bean and stewed fruit aromas in this wine. The forward palate shows sweet and sour notes of mature, fleshy black cherry, prune, licorice and clove alongside seasoned tannins. A toasted hazelnut note closes the finish Drink soon to catch the remaining fruit and freshness.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98936
"23263","This opens with aromas of blue iris, plum and menthol. On the palate, subtle notes of sage, toast and coffee accent a core of fleshy black cherry. It still has tightly wound, drying tannins that need to unwind but it's rather shy on fresh acidity so best to enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",23263
"94505","If you are a fan of Pinot Bianco, a white wine with a smooth and rich mouthfeel, Eichhorn makes a great choice from Italy. The variety offers mild aromas of peach and melon, but the natural richness of the wine's texture makes it perfect for sophisticated creamy fish dishes like baccalà.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",94505
"60185","Just a touch of dried pear and chamomile tisane appear on the shy nose which needs air to open. The palate already has that balm-like concentration of mature Riesling which is joined by a vein of wonderful lemon-zest freshness. Despite the absolute dryness of the palate there is ample, generous and deep-seated fruit: pear, apple and gorgeous tangerine. The finish is clean-cut and resonant. Drink now–2030.","White","Riesling","France",60185
"69156","By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",69156
"234","This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015–2024.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",234
"24294","Gritty aromas of asphalt, herbs, tomato and plum make for a tough opening. This is syrupy and grabby on the palate, with creamy berry and cooked brown-sugar flavors. A sinewy finish tastes medicinal and a touch weedy.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",24294
"45871","This is a big, rich style of Pinot, with toast, vanilla and bacon marking the nose. While the palate delivers more black cherry fruit, it still remains savory overall. It's slightly chewy on the finish, so drink 2017–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",45871
"90334","The lightness of texture and crisp acidity make this Pinot Noir easy to drink now. The raspberry and cola flavors finish clean and dry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90334
"76064","A wine that suffers somewhat from an abundance of ripe, jammy flavors, this is round and rowdy, completely rich and full, with highlights of coconut, leather and black pepper that persists with power.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",76064
"92110","Pear compote, salty lemon and limestone define the flavor profile of this medium-bodied white that lives up to its reserve-tier billing. Integrated oak meets lifted acidity, providing a refreshing, food-friendly experience.","White","Chardonnay","US",92110
"12546","Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, violet and a whiff of baking spice. On the bright silky palate, notes of pipe tobacco, chopped herb and a hint of game add depth to the red-berry core.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",12546
"93127","Reduced, jammy berry aromas open this loud Malbec that ambles across the palate with no sense of restraint. All about gritty, screaming red-fruit flavors and baked notes, it lacks elegance.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",93127
"13056","There is the slightest hint of ripe pineapple about this fruit-driven white. The palate offers up more texture than fruit with wonderful frank freshness and pleasant nudges of yeast. Drink soon.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",13056
"78409","Rich and layered, this impressive wine is memorable in its full grasp of cherry grenadine and cola, the succulent flavors spiked in spicy clove. On the lengthy finish, it takes on a blueberry note that's welcome in its balance of sweet and sour.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78409

"28165","Light tawny in color, this palate-pleasing effort boasts stone fruit, orange blossom and fresh herb flavors. It's elegant and food-friendly in style, with the sort of detail that usually comes with a higher price tag.","White","Pinot Gris","US",28165
"95427","There's more than a whiff of eucalyptus, olive and herb aromas on the nose, but there's also a dry berry hint underneath. It hits with hard acids and tannins but settles, while cherry and plum flavors come across herbal and dry. A sinewy blend of 50% Syrah, 30% Carignan and 20% Malbec.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",95427
"15210","Smooth, soft wine, very accessible and up-front. The stewed fruit flavors and fresh acidity give an attractive lift to this open wine.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",15210
"858","This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.","Red","Merlot","US",858
"88390","This oaky wine opens with a huge pop of toasty, burnt aromas. It's resiny feeling, with a creamy palate. Hard time spent in Hungarian barrels has resulted in flavors of toasty apple, cinnamon and peppery spices. This lacks harmony.","White","Chardonnay","Mexico",88390
"42638","Aromas of celery, arugula, snap pea, dusty apple and citrus announce a clean palate with scouring acidity. Lemon-lime and grapefruit flavors are typical of Casablanca SB, while a fresh, citrusy finish brings a green-herb element into play.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",42638
"40747","Barbaresco Ad Altiora is characterized by plumpness and ripeness of fruit. That rich, natural succulence is backed by firm tannins and drying sensations of exotic spice, licorice and tobacco leaf. The balance between those two extremes is what sets this bold red wine apart.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",40747
"96330","Belcier is on the slope that continues east from Saint-Émilion. With this provenance, this single vineyard wine offers rich Merlot to go with the more structured Cabernet fruit.

"83450","After an early aromatic blast of sulfuric matchstick, this turns for the better while providing scents of citrus, fresh-cut grass and minerals. The palate is zesty, with briny flavors of nectarine and orange. A minerally, slightly salty finish keeps this on course.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",83450
"93442","Initially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.","Red","Mencía","Spain",93442

"11830","An easygoing blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this bright red offers aromas and flavors of black cherry, red currant, coffee and vanilla. It's simple but well made, with supple tannins and zesty acidity.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",11830
"22295","This Pinot's parts haven't found each other yet. There's big, ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet, toasty oak, brisk acids and firm tannins, yet they form an unruly confederation. Stash this in the cellar until at least 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",22295
"53941","Savory but also stewy on the nose, this Malbec offers muddled berry and spiced cherry aromas. In the mouth, this is flush and jammy but not all that exact. Spicy, herbal, peppery plum and black-currant flavors finish with heat and roasted notes.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",53941

"100284","Aromas of wild berry, violet, rose and Mediterranean herb lead the nose of this easy drinking, polished red. The juicy palate doles out blackberry, black cherry, white pepper and star anise while bright acidity and supple tannins offer support. Drink through 2017.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",100284
"2607","Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",2607
"29329","With a little Petite Sirah and Carignane blended in for depth and complexity, this is a nice Zinfandel for everyday drinking.

"70277","Impressively dry, medium bodied, very firmly tannic and showing complex fruit flavors, this Zinfandel-based wine needs time to mellow. It smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries, and tastes concentrated and mouthcoating, while the astringent tannins hold everything back just a bit. It contains 34% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah, and will be best after 2018.","Red","Red Blend","US",70277
"31890","Menthol, eucalyptus, violet, berry, clove and sage aromas all meld together on this savory wine. The bright, succulent palate delivers dense black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with mocha, cinnamon and vanilla alongside a backbone of brisk acidity and fine tannins. It's tempting now but will be even better after 2018.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",31890
"63051","This wine will suit those who are drawn to Riesling's food-pairing genius but don't want the explosion of fruit this variety normally provides. The nose is mineral-driven with aromas of beeswax while the palate is quite austere and finishes with a dry, acidic kick.","White","Riesling","France",63051
"67453","This is raisiny and soupy on the nose. A jammy, soft palate follows suit, while the flavors are pure prune and raisin. Stewy on the finish, this is overripe but still good. Drink soon.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",67453
"6158","Sharp and rustic, with medicinal, LifeSaver candy cherry flavors that finish with a scour of acidity.","Red","Grenache","US",6158
"105673","Fresh, fruity and acidic, this young Pinot Noir wants some time in the cellar. It's brilliantly structured, with a core of black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, mushrooms and spices, with rich notes of smoke, cocoa and cedar. Silky and complex, and should age through 2013.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105673

"95197","It's hard to find a favorite within Dr. Loosen's excellent line up of 2015 auslese, but this bottling stands out for its kaleidoscope of fruit, floral and earthen complexities. Sumptuous and ripe, fleshy white peach and grapefruit flavors undulate on the palate. It's finely framed, edged by sharp lines of slate, spine-tingling acidity and swathes of fennel and earth. The finish feels fragile, laced in sweetness and lingering.","White","Riesling","Germany",95197
"102100","Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins. Yet it should age effortlessly through 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",102100
"85383","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Carménère, Malbec and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of purple fruit, green herb, clove, barrel spice and spice box.

Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",85383
"32690","Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.","White","Chardonnay","US",32690
"49057","A big wine, round and ripe with luscious flavors of peach, pineapple and citrus fruits, layered into plenty of toasty oak. It's smooth and seductive, and the finish, which tastes like a dessert of toasty hazelnuts and cream, is especially enticing. Just a bit of heat runs through it.","White","Chardonnay","US",49057
"8466","Not very Oakville-like, this Cabernet is bone dry and strong in tannins, giving it an astringent mouthfeel. It's light in body for a Cabernet, with lots of acidity. However, it does have pretty flavors of blackberry and sour cherry candy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8466
"57178","A light and fruity wine, this is attractively crisp and with a caramel edge. The wine is bright with touches of orange and lively final acidity. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",57178

"100392","Bright acidity gives mouthwatering liveliness to the tropical fruit, Meyer lemon, pear, vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotchy oak flavors. It's made to order for the popular style.","White","Chardonnay","US",100392
"98502","A showcase of Lodi's ability to grow an array of grapes, particularly red varieties, Incognito is an amalgam of Syrah, Carignane, Mourvèdre, Souzão, Tannat, Cinsault, Petite Sirah and Merlot, with flavors ranging from cranberry to chocolate. It's smooth, with medium body and tannic structure.","Red","Red Blend","US",98502

There's a sweet tone of cherry and vanilla in the mouth and the wine's texture is thick and chewy.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",103589
"1225","Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.","White","Pinot Grigio","Argentina",1225
"4137","Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now, but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4137
"3134","Gentle aromas of apple and fresh citrus give way to some autolytic yeastiness. Altogether, this is a very restrained but elegant sparkler, with soft mousse and a refreshing streak of acidity.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Austria",3134
"55889","Named for the producer's farmhouse and its surrounding vineyard, this offers rich cherry cordial and weedy sage notes—a seamless mix of fruit and earth. Sage, cardamom and spicy white pepper flavors give it intrigue and complexity, wrapped in a thick, velvety texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55889
"43149","Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate.","Red","Merlot","US",43149

"26180","Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice.

"104293","Scratchy, slightly grassy red-fruit aromas feed into a lean palate with raw acidity. Flavors of herbs, mint and tangy berry fruits lean toward green, while the finish is fresh yet abrasive.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",104293
"84379","A barely-there glimpse of lemon bids you to step closer and take a sip. The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to. Drink 2018–2030.","White","Riesling","Austria",84379
"56071","This great buy shows a sophisticated blend of spice and fruit aromas. Medium-bodied and classically dry, it has good balance, moderate fruit flavors and light toast and ginger notes that add complexity.","White","Chardonnay","US",56071

"70452","Dry, brisk in acidity and ripe, this has stimulating minerality that undergirds the fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, lime and guava. But what dominates is the hugeness of size and the richness that goes on and on.","White","Chardonnay","US",70452
"75020","This vineyard sits quite near the cool Cambria coastline, yet the grape-growing challenges faced with each vintage are not present on this wine, which combines raspberry, cedar and pan-seared peppercorns on the excellent nose. The palate is powered by gingerbread cake topped with a clove-berry sauce.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75020
"5270","This light- to medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc appears to aim at a minerally style, marrying hints of green (veggies?) with otherwise pleasant citrusy aromas and flavors. Grapefruit and anise make an appearance on the finish. Drink up.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",5270
"77328","Vibrant aromas of pear and apple lead to a creamy, full-feeling palate. It's a strong example of the variety and style.","White","Chardonnay","US",77328
"72247","Tropical guava and mango surround a restrained cradling of French oak, only 15% of it new, in this easy-to-like, approachable wine. Wrappings of vanilla and honeysuckle complete the picture, with a straightforward, relatively lengthy finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",72247
"31427","The song of the frogs, aka the croak, is an odd name for this wine made from organically grown grapes. The wine itself is soft, easy and light, with red berry fruits and some perfumed acidity. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",31427
"26483","This wine from Caves de Rauzan is ripe, with a strongly floral and aromatic character. It also has good acidity and richness. It is on the cusp of being delicious, so wait until late summer 2017.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",26483
"11758","This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a best barrels selection. It's the densest, most tannic of David Arthur's current releases, a massive wine stuffed with black currants, blackberries, anise, tobacco and smoky new oak. Best of all, it's dry, dry, dry. Fine now, if you're into young wines, but should age well in a good cellar for many years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",11758
"68686","This wondrously vibrant and energetic wine shows fresh-pressed raspberries and strawberries on the zesty nose alongside fennel bulb and sandalwood. The just-ripe raspberry and cherry-tomato flavors on the palate make for an intriguingly light elegance, but it's sewn together with a defined structure. Thyme and oregano herbs complete the experience.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68686
"26724","This Sangiovese wants decanting for a few hours to let it breathe and open up. Right out of the bottle, it's acidic and tannic, with lots of astringency covering the cherry, red currant and tobacco flavors. Drink now, with rich, oily fare.","Red","Sangiovese","US",26724
"57509","Aged in stainless steel and small barrels of French oak, this wine remains smooth and silky with interweaved acidity, a classic, fresh expression of the variety with very subtle oak. Vanilla and pear find their way onto the finish, providing additional layers of flavor and finesse.","White","Chardonnay","US",57509
"34869","With grapes from 40-year-old vines, this is a dense and concentrated wine. Yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus flavors give a balance between richness and freshness. It has high alcohol that shows in the light pepper edge although this doesn't detract from the fruitiness of the aftertaste. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",34869
"101752","Tannins mask the light fruitiness in this blend of 45% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. It seems extracted, with the producer attempting to get too much out of the fruit in a lean year.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",101752
"37848","Despite the rich, buttery, toasty oak notes, this wine stands up to the barrel influence with its strong tropical fruit and pear flavors, as well as its brisk acidity and stony minerality. It's ready to drink now with rich fare like lobsters or scallops.","White","Chardonnay","US",37848
"88985","The reserve Chardonnay from Eola Hills gets an extra year in bottle, and it has a more elegant, vertical structure, with the fruit framed in toasty oak flavors and some tarragon spice. It's persistent as well; the flavors seem to gather strength in the midpalate and continue through a strong and moderately complex finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",88985
"68851","Fresh and linear, this offers spring wild flower and white stone fruit aromas while the luminous palate offers Bosc pear, citrus and a hint of white almond. It has a bright, slightly tangy finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",68851
"62708","Though not at all unsung (in fact, mailing list is closed), Abeja wines offer exceptional quality for the price across the entire lineup. Case in point: this super-long, ultradelicious Chardonnay, a generous wine with green apple, lime and white peach; add in notes of butter, brioche and baking spices. The length and balance, along with the pure pleasure, far exceed the price.","White","Chardonnay","US",62708
"13722","Honey, honeysuckle and peach on the nose create a most inviting aroma. These flavors are even more clearly apparent on the medium-dry palate where they are brightened and intensified by lemon freshness. This is intense and fluid, rounded and soft, and yet it manages to remain fresh and appetizing. Drink soon.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",13722
"43376","A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",43376
"100358","Fresh green plum, peach and honeydew flavors taste crisp and sweet in this refreshing semi-sweet spätlese. It's concentrated with fruit yet deft and dancing on the palate, accented by hints of dusty pollen and fennel. High-toned acidity leads a long, squeaky-clean finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",100358
"67918","This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit. Textured in soft undertones of silk, it also offers plenty of fresh herb, a component to take advantage of in pairing.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67918
"35711","Complex, classy winemaking is evident from the first sniff to the final sip. Savory notes of green tea and clean earth complement a terroir-driven wine. The notes and nuances pile on—flowers and fruits, cherry and cassis, with a whiff of barnyard and undergrowth. The lingering, expressive finish is already boggling, and seems sure to continue to evolve gracefully through 2025–2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35711
"37233","Grassy strawberry and raspberry aromas smell false as well as floral. A blocky palate with jammy stickiness and rubbery tannins carries medicinal, resiny, candied berry flavors, with green overtones. This feels raw on the finish while tasting green and jammy.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",37233
"27116","Brisk acidity is the best thing about this sweet Sauvignon Blanc. It has jammy flavors of pineapples and oranges. Bring on the sausages and ham.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",27116
"43249","This is an elaborately constructed wine, rich in fruit and tannins, and far better than the rather ordinary 2006. But it's nowhere near ready to drink now. Erupts with ripe, juicy blackberries, black cherries, minerals and sweet cassis. The grapes are from the Pope Valley region. Very big, bold and dramatic, but immature. Hold for a good six years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43249
"18214","It's too bad that this blend of 75% Zinfandel, 12% Cabernet Franc and 13% Syrah is only found in Bermuda. Elderberry, tobacco and blueberry-stuffed chocolate power the dense nose, yet the palate shows a fresh lightness, with mint and menthol lifting the cherry juice and tannic grip that structures the sip.","Red","Red Blend","US",18214
"96886","Despite a good track record producing California Pinot Noir, Tangley Oaks' foray north into the Willamette Valley does not impress. It tastes and smells of mushroom compost, with no hint of any definitive fruit, no suggestion of varietal character. Two bottles tasted, same results.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96886
"74314","For a big, simple style of Pinot Noir, this gets the job done. It's dark and mulled on the nose, with boistrous plum and cherry flavors that darken up and turn peppery on the finish. This emphasizes freshness and size more than finesse.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",74314
"70642","A touch foxy and reduced on the nose, with jumpy berry aromas, this feels edgy and shows a grating tannic bite. The wine's plum, herb and candied berry flavors are solid, finishing with a dose of blueberry.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",70642
"41978","Here's a classically crafted Barolo with Nebbiolo's quintessential fragrance of rose, cherry and balsamic herbs. The palate is still tightly wound but shows wild cherry and spice, with firm but fine tannins. Needs time to develop complexity. Best after 2015.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",41978
"26570","There is a heavy wood presence in this wine. For now, it dominates with burnt toast and dark chocolate flavors. Happily, the fruit is also developing well, bringing its fresh black-currant flavors into the balance. Drink this still-young wine from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26570
"40909","Crisp and penetrating, with great fruit purity, the wine's core bears cassis and black cherry flavors. The tannins are supple, even silky, and the finish is smooth, with dark accents.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",40909
"42280","Restrained and dusty in leathery tannin, this wine opens in the glass to unravel bold black-fruit and licorice power, offering stark succulence and moderate acidity on the palate.","Red","Zinfandel","US",42280
"67415","From a unique vineyard site high above the Santa Maria Valley comes this bottling by the Fess Parker family that shows white pepper, tart elderberry, a touch of tar and dried herbs on the somewhat restrained nose. There is decent herbal lift to the black cassis and blackberry fruit, with hints of lavender and dried tarragon.","Red","Syrah","US",67415
"71253","Featuring tobacco, cassis and lesser quantities of mint and cocoa, d'Arenberg's The High Trellis Cabernet is a full-bodied wine that offers plenty of flavor interest and depth at a reasonable price. It does show some slightly chewy, dusty tannins on the finish, but the fruit ultimately wins through, suggesting it will be at its best from 2010–2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",71253
"47218","Green and invigorating peppery tones accent this lemony Sauvignon Blanc. It's not a deeply complex penetrating wine but is vivaciously fresh through the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",47218
"99254","Soft notes of honeysuckle hover over the waxy scent of fresh honeycomb. Meadow flowers gild those flavors with honest freshness. The palate holds a gentle softness, letting the honeyed, developed notes of this restrained Gewurztraminer convey both fir-honey bitterness and blossom-sweet ease. This shows supreme balance and seems young and fresh for an eight-year-old wine. It comes from a supreme, balanced and cool year that shows its mettle with age.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",99254
"70254","Smooth and rich, its tannins are buried in the ripe, sumptuous fruit. It's packed with red-berry, wild-strawberry and raspberry flavors, along with intense and juicy acidity. The structure does have a dry edge that promises aging, although the wine is very ready to drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",70254
"84103","Benjamin Silver offers a very traditional tar and roses nose on this solid wine, with extra aromas of leather, iron, pipe smoke, iodine and beef jerky. The palate shows white pepper, roasted fennel and tight pomegranate fruit, with some gaminess and tobacco leaf, as well as grippy tannins that will continue to soften with time.","Red","Nebbiolo","US",84103
"25018","A year's barrel aging has given this firm and very rich wine a spicy character. That marries with the licorice and bitter chocolate to give a ripe, extracted and dense wine. It needs a few years to bring out more of the juicy plum fruitiness. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",25018
"66931","This Casablanca SB opens with crisp, dry, capped aromas of ocean foam, citrus and green herbs. It's true to form in the mouth, with nice acidity and citrusy zest. Flavors of citrus and green herbs are focused but pithy, while the finish is fresh, crisp and tastes of lime and thyme.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",66931
"59624","A haze of summer flowers hovers across a fizzy feast of crunchy, green apple. Autolytic notes of bread stay clearly in the background while this easy, joyful wine majors on primary, crisp apple fruit and a whistle-clean finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","England",59624
"56561","A very good white wine, perfectly dry, with streamlined flavors of grapefruit, fig and lime, and creamy, vanilla complexities from barrel fermentation. Appealing in the mouth, and near as good as California Sauvignon Blanc gets.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",56561
"30078","Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",30078
"82153","Meaning “The Thief,” Il Ladro blends 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. A silky smooth blockbuster of a wine, it dances in acidity with bright cherry, clove and spice throughout. The tannins are well-behaved and in the background, the finish exceptionally long.","Red","Red Blend","US",82153
"33416","Dusty mineral and smoke tones add complexity to fresh lemon and lime aromas on this concentrated, powerful off-dry Riesling. It's lush and silky on the palate, with ripe pineapple and yellow peach flavors. Lime juice acidity jolts the finish.","White","Riesling","US",33416
"44832","If you cellar only a few Napa Cabernets a year, this is one you should seek out. It's so tannic, so shut down, yet so explosive in blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and sweet oak, that it will easily negotiate the next decade. If you really have to open it before 2015, at least give it a decent decant.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44832
"59149","Light, airy and leesy on the nose, this is more complex than most everyday Albariños. Additional aromas of vanilla wafer, acacia, honeydew and minerals lead to a clean-flowing palate. Minerally peach and nectarine flavors show a touch of almond-skin bitterness on the finish.","White","Albariño","Spain",59149
"102638","A little light in body and flavor, but easy to drink, with complex raspberry, cherry, blueberry, mocha, tobacco, vanilla, smoke and peppery spice flavors. At its best now. Try with sliced flank steak, stuffed into pita bread with cole slaw.","Red","Zinfandel","US",102638
"69160","Sharp in acidity and bone dry, this is a good, everyday Pinot Noir. It shows a properly silky texture, and flavors of cola, cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69160
"91732","Fine and fresh, this has clean fruit, a touch of caramel along with crisp white peach and creamy apple. The wine is light, soft, accessible now.","White","Chardonnay","France",91732
"48050","This wine is smoky yet fresh and juicy. It has a light touch of red-currant fruits, a crisp texture and bright acidity. The tannins are gentle, leaving pride of place to the natural fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48050
"36797","Soft, gentle fruit of stewed apple shimmers on the nose but on the palate is contained by immense, lemony zestiness. There is real muscle and elegance. The body is dry, slender but concentrated and beautifully clean with inflections of stone. This is a beacon of clarity and clean fruit, shining with a pristine, citrus-kissed purity. Drink 2018–2030.","White","Riesling","France",36797
"89532","A big-boned wine with a juicy midpalate, this round, plush expression of the variety offers welcome layers of dark cherry, raspberry and plum nicely accentuated with clove and sage.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89532
"46478","A hint of lime and green pear peel, a touch of pepper and passion fruit: this subtle and light white does not give too much away. However its acidity and texture make it a versatile and satisfying food partner.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",46478
"35790","A compact opening with reduced aromas of raisin and cassis sets up a plump, chunky palate with round, easygoing flavors of raisin, cassis and berry syrup. This is full, flashy and dark, but not particularly complex. Drink through 2015.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",35790
"28994","This is a luscious wine with a smooth and hearty mouthfeel, ample ripe fruit reminiscent of pears and white peaches, and vanilla and honey accents on both the nose and palate. Fermented in neutral barrels, it doesn't have oaky flavors but feels soft in acidity and seems to melt in the mouth.","White","Viognier","US",28994
"50045","Dark fruit aromas lead a rustic, earthy, smoky bouquet towards a crisp, healthy palate with ample oak that creates a buttery taste to accent dry berry flavors, a light herbal character and pepper. Fresh, solid and well oaked.","Red","Merlot","Chile",50045
"67667","Candied pineapple, spun sugar, ripe key lime peels and lemongrass show on the nose of this stainless steel-aged wine. The expected crispness shows on the sip as does an energetic and lively acidity, though the honeysuckle and lemon syrup flavors trend toward sweetness.","White","Chardonnay","US",67667
"62217","Comfortable enough, with common aromas of black fruit, spice, earth and leather. Given that production on this wine is now a whopping million cases, anything palatable should be considered a success. Casillero has reasonably good plum, cassis and brambly flavors, with a hint of oak in support. The mouthfeel is narrow, but overall the wine tastes real.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",62217
"43922","All Elephant Mountain Vineyard fruit, this wine provides aromas of coffee, red plum and spice. It's soft and velvety in feel with café au lait flavors that linger.","Red","Merlot","US",43922
"62486","From a biodynamic vineyard in the heart of Sancerre, this wine is tight, mineral-driven and very young, well balanced between herbal and citrus flavors. These are lifted and filled out with the ripe Rocha pear flavors that give an extra juicy element. The wine will age well and will be better after 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",62486
"64520","This well-balanced, medium-bodied wine blends ripe strawberry aromas and blackberry flavors with a lively texture that's bolstered by good acidity and firm tannins. It's easy to enjoy the fresh fruitiness.","Red","Merlot","US",64520
"73535","Aromas of menthol, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit come together on this accessible, full-bodied red. The ripe, chewy palate offers cherries marinated in spirits, blackberry jam, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",73535
"84513","Wiry red-berry aromas are lean and stalky smelling. This feels tight with little excess weight or body. Flavors of peppery red fruits come with a broadside shot of oak in front of a short finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",84513
"84574","This 100% Sauvignon Blanc is made in a ripe style, with refreshing acidity. The complex flavors range from tart gooseberries, limes and kumquats to golden mangoes, with lots of vanilla and sweet toast notes from the new oak.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",84574
"65919","This powerful and ripe wine is a blend of juicy Merlot, perfumed Cabernet Franc and fruity Petit Verdot. It has weight, richness, layers of spice and peppered black plums. There are some tannins, but the wine is really ready to drink now until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",65919
"72119","This attractive, herbal wine has intense fruitiness but misses any sense of place. It has appealing white currant and grapefruit flavors and a tight finish of acidity. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",72119
"39038","Subdued aromas suggest woodland berry and underbrush. The palate is more expressive, offering red cherry, strawberry and licorice alongside supple tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",39038
"45888","Oaky, lean red-fruit aromas precede a scratchy, thin, resiny feeling palate. This tastes of oak on top of underdeveloped, stunted red berries, while the finish is herbal, woody tasting and heavily spiced.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",45888
"102686","The lime, mineral and flower aromas are inviting. On the palate, light, powdery flavors of lime, kiwi and green melon take over. It tastes a little green on the finish, like tarragon, but overall it's fresh, dry and easy to drink. This is a blend of 40% Macabeo and 40% Parellada and 20% Sauvignon Blanc.","White","White Blend","Spain",102686
"101034","A tight, freshly acid wine, with stalkiness but also good juicy fruit. There is a green pepper element, leaving a wine that is light, simple.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",101034
"104106","Cristia's style typically features dynamic cherry fruit; the 2006's aromas include an almost floral element as well, plus hints of almond paste. It's a very lush and red-fruited wine, somewhere between creamy and velvety in texture, with just a touch of astringency on the finish. Drink now–2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",104106
"104214","Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, chopped sage, mint and roasted coffee bean alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",104214
"966","Aromas of blackberry and briar patch expand to include violet notes. In the mouth, there's pulpy weight to the fruit and rubbery tannins for framing. Rugged but generic black-fruit flavors finish with toasty darkness and some burn.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",966
"77221","Marked by sugary orange, apricot, lemon and vanilla flavors, this Viognier is a bit simple on its own. Balanced with crisp acidity, it will pair well with slghtly sweet Asian fare.","White","Viognier","US",77221
"36379","Barrel aromas are up front, with notes of vanilla, dill and wood spice in front of dark fruit. The fruit flavors are plump and plush, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. There are lots of good things going on here but the wood gets in the way—a shame as the fruit is impressive.","Red","Syrah","US",36379
"29123","Juicy, with a firmness of acidity and a tenacious crispness, this wine evolves in the glass, shedding some of its wet stone and green apple for more voluptuous tenets of Asian pear and nutmeg. Lovely for the table, this is a well-balanced white that'll do well on its own or with food.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",29123
"61789","A solid everyday Merlot that offers plenty of ripe berry, cherry and smoky oak flavors now. Dry and tannic, it has enough stuffing and class to pair with a nice steak.","Red","Merlot","US",61789
"46186","A bit burnt in grilled cherry fruit and tart in acidity, but otherwise it's a nice, silky Pinot Noir, with pleasant spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46186
"70802","A whiff of crumbled clay lends an earthen tone to this vibrant lime-edged spätlese. Crisp green plum and grapefruit flavors are juicy and fresh, sweetened by a kiss of honey. It's gossamer light in texture yet lingers with a lacy haze of sweet citrus.","White","Riesling","Germany",70802
"96816","The tannins are so fierce on this baby Cabernet that they effectively lock it down and make it tough to drink now. Yet there's a fabulous core of blackberries that are rich, ripe and intense. Everything about it suggests ageability. Give it at least eight years in a proper cellar, and it could age even longer.","Red","Merlot","US",96816
"20720","This superb Carmenère is lusty but intricate on the bouquet, with aromas of baked plum, blackberry, balsam wood, leather and horse hide. The palate shows a complex blend of high-voltage power and density; flavors of roasted blackberry, chocolate, pepper and root beer finish deep and oaky. Drink through 2020.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",20720
"85788","Only 30 cases of this gorgeous wine are imported, so snag what you can when you find it. It's a deep and complex Syrah, exuding attractive aromas and flavors of juicy red cherry and fresh raspberry spiced up with accents of vanilla crème, sweet wood, soft Earl Gray tea and whole baking spice on the close. Creamy and lush with a silky texture; drink now–2014.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",85788
"5967","Notes of peach and ripe, yellow plum join a mix of citrus flavors that range from spiky lime to fruity clementine, making for a friendly, refreshing and dry Riesling. Its freshness brightens the palate and shows highlights of pineapple","White","Riesling","France",5967
"16198","This wine is a mix of fruit from Anna Marie and McClellan Estate vineyards. The aromas offer notes of dark roasted coffee, vanilla, herbs, spice and cherry, with the barrel notes initially at the fore. The palate is textured and supple, with the feel and flavors keeping the attention high.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",16198
"422","Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.","Red","Syrah","Chile",422
"101617","While herbaceous, this wine also has ripe tropical fruits that bring out a richer, early drinking side. It's bone-dry and crisp, the apricot fruits balanced by intense citrus. Concentrated and very fruity, it can be drunk now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",101617
"71191","Bold aromas of bread dough and strong flavors of herbs and stewed fruit flavors compete for attention. This wine is medium bodied, smooth in texture and rustic in flavor.","Red","Red Blend","US",71191
"66414","Heavy wood aromas are mitigated on the palate by the ripe fruit, making for a rich wine with black plum flavors as well as a core of tannins. It's going to develop well and quickly, so drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",66414
"84478","Plummy and ripe, with a sheen of glossy, cedary oak, this is as plush as it gets in the northern Rhône. It's full-bodied, supple and open, with a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2030.","Red","Syrah","France",84478
"63948","This New Mexico Cab offers exotic spice and tobacco on the nose and cigarbox, smoked meat and red berry on the palate. Robust and masculine, it will pair well with grilled steaks, barbecue chicken and spicy cuisine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63948
"85534","For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",85534
"59221","From the northern end of the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation, this wine is ripe, floral and supple in texture. It has crisp red fruit and vibrant acidity, underpinned by ripe tannins. Developing quickly, it will be ready to drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",59221
"36304","sweet-tart candy, vanilla, and pineapple scent this Traminer and Chardonnay blend. It's zesty in the mouth, tasting of grapefruit and lemon zest.","White","White Blend","Moldova",36304
"86563","Tortoise Creek makes bargain wines from the Languedoc region of France as well as from Lodi. “The Chelonian” is a new label a portion of the proceeds of which will go to the Chelonian Research Foundation to help benefit the conservation of turtles and tortoises. The wine itself is a decent representation of Lodi's bigger, more raisiny style.","Red","Zinfandel","US",86563
"35422","The 2011 vintage was a cold one in Chile and this Cab reflects that. It's pumping out loads of olive, green herbs and oak on the nose, and that's followed by a tannic palate with minty, green flavors of olive, thyme, pepper and generic berry fruits. Not surprisngly, the finish is fairly green.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",35422
"83858","The small 2015 vintage didn't give John Benedetti much to work with, but he sources 60% from Bald Mountain Vineyard in Bonny Doon and 40% from Split Rail in Corralitos to deliver this stunner. Aromas of Marcona almond, buttered croissant and lemon preserves lead into a palate full of acidic energy. Salty, savory flavors of roasted nuts meet with warm buttercream and fresh lemon spray on the palate. It provides a full experience.","White","Chardonnay","US",83858
"15550","It's not easy assessing this blend of Monastrell and Petit Verdot from a warm vintage. It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors. It's not missing any potency or ripeness, but the longer you work with it the larger and more medicinal it gets. Think big Zinfandel from California when you take this on.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",15550
"25207","This little brother to vino Nobile embodies the essence of ripe, lip-smacking country wine. But it's no piece of candy; quite the contrary, it's full, rustic and fruit-forward. If elegance isn't the game here, then the big plum flavor and meaty, berry-loaded finish is.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",25207
"71394","There's no hiding the 24 months in French oak this Zin spent after growing up in an organic and dry-farmed vineyard. Medium to heavyweight it's all about ripe strawberry and blackberry, sweet to the point of being in a pie, rounded out by graham cracker and a fine fruit liqueur.","Red","Zinfandel","US",71394
"66208","This herbal wine is full of crisp green fruit. It has lively grapefruit and lime flavors as well as tangy acidity. Spicy on the finish, it's ready to drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",66208
"74597","The Freestone Hill bottling is one of Dutton Goldfield's biggest and most powerful Pinot Noirs, and the '06 is nearly as stunning as the magnificent '05. It just explodes in the mouth with succulent cherry and raspberry pie, mocha and spicy anise and pepper flavors, with fabulous complexities from smoky oak. Terrific now, but the tannins will hold it for a decade.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",74597
"89475","This brut offers notes of citrus, stone fruit and Mediterranean herbs. It's fresh and linear, with an elegant perlage. The quenching finish closes on a note of bitter walnut.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",89475
"28215","This is a big, full-bodied and nicely balanced wine, with hefty blackberry and cherry flavors matched to a firm texture of rich acidity and fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",28215
"60634","Tilled soil, lead pencil, thyme, iris and wild berry aromas take center stage on this fragrant red. It's vibrant and young, with crushed strawberry, red raspberry cinnamon and white pepper flavors framed in lively acidity and taut youthfully austere tannins. A licorice note closes the finish. Drink 2023–2033.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",60634
"24403","This straight Barolo shows delicate floral and cherry aromas and a hint of underbrush. The linear palate shows restrained red fruit and hints of spice, but it lacks the richness to balance the aggressive and rather drying tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",24403
"942","Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",942
"44863","Young and very much still developing, Sentinel Oak is Terre Rouge's single-vineyard Syrah, a spicy, smoky concoction of great depth, intensity and beauty, concentrated and eager to mature. This wine has a pronounced meaty quality to it, and will pair accordingly, particularly with smoked meat, which will accentuate its own smoky allure.","Red","Syrah","US",44863
"72765","Although this is a little rustic, it offers a good value for the money for a Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast. It shares in common with far more expensive wines a light, silky texture and crisp coastal acidity that balance the cherry, sassafras and smoky oak flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72765
"80924","Smoky, roasted and full on the bouquet, with rich berry and plum aromas. The palate is fleshy, with a chunky middle but just enough tannin and acid to provide structure. Tastes of baked black fruits, fig and herbs. Dry and snappy on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",80924
"87690","This late-release has benefited from its time in bottle. Juicy and beguiling in red raspberry and black cherry fruit, it has a back layering of spicy cardamom and a sphere of acidity. Buoyant and memorable, it finishes with more spice and savory leather.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87690
"18992","Barrel fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine brings aromas of toasty barrel spices, peach and lemon curd. It's full bodied and creamy in feel, with the alcohol poking through and providing some distraction.","White","Chardonnay","US",18992
"100712","This medium-dry wine offers a drier core of spice and pepper. Around this, yellow fruits and creamed pears come to the fore. The wine is ready to drink now, although it will be worth waiting until 2016.","White","Pinot Gris","France",100712
"72806","Rooty aromas of licorice, leather and blackberry improve with airing. This shows hard tannins and a grabby palate along with rooty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum that finish with blackened spice notes, licorice root flavors and lively acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",72806
"97536","Oily citrus, apple and mealy grapefruit are not particularly pleasant aromas. This is heavy and sticky, with overweight citrus and mango flavors. A melony, sulfuric finish brings the close.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",97536
"85086","A 100% varietal wine, this is a tense study in black cherry, blueberry, and dry chalky tannins, which need further time to resolve. Still puckering on the finish, it offers streaks of cedar, pencil lead and coconut that are still integrating. Drink now through 2023.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85086
"60679","This offers aromas of feral berry, black olive and bell pepper followed by a black fruit flavor that's touched by a herbal note. It starts out better than it finishes.","Red","Malbec","Chile",60679
"11486","This opens with aromas recalling stewed plum, nutmeg, vanilla and a suggestion of blue flower. The ripe palate has a firm structure that supports dried black cherry, clove and aromatic herb while astringent tannins generate an abrupt, somewhat raspy finish. Give the tannins a few more years to mellow then drink.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",11486
"91831","Aromas of steeped cherries, ripe plums, scorched earth and a medley of cooking spices lead the nose on this round, rich wine. The lush palate doles out ripe black cherries, raspberry jam, licorice and a dash of black pepper while velvety tannins lend finesse.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",91831
"1437","One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",1437
"7552","This blend of 43% Syrah, 31% Mourvèdre, 23%  Grenache and 3% Alicante Bouschet opens with an elegant and nuanced nose, featuring scents of blackberry crumble, lilac and other purple flowers. The tart, earthy flavors combine black raspberry and vanilla with beet root, black earth and sagebrush. A deep, heady blend.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",7552
"48585","Honig's basic Napa Cab is a pleasant wine to drink now. It shows an elegance of tannins and acids, with well-ripened blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors that finish with refinement.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",48585
"63015","This is the second vintage release for the estate vineyard, which occupies the highest planted portion of Red Mountain. Precise, sharp-edged, high-acid red-fruit flavors of berry and cherry seem stacked vertically, with a strong mineral underpinning. The alcohol is a bit high, but overall the structure holds together and would support further aging; drink now–2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63015
"93708","The aromas are bright, with notes of guava, pineapple and citrus. The palate is lightly spritzy with plenty of grapefruit flavors that keep the interest high.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",93708
"99480","This Bordeaux-style blend has pretty aromas of cassis, fig, molasses and strawberry jam. The palate picks up some dried fruit and more molasses. This is an easy drinker, with a soft tannic structure and mild weight.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",99480
"59390","This is light, bright and easy, with clean notes of Granny Smith apple, pear, and a hint of fresh grass. The tart palate is sharp but refreshing, with a medium-length, mouthwatering finish.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",59390
"49156","This rich and voluptuous wine wins one over with its baked pear and vanilla sumptuousness, etched with an apple blossom aroma. Robust and velvety on the palate, it's balanced by fresh citrus and wet stone nuances. The lifted acidity provokes both succulence and complexity.","White","Chardonnay","US",49156
"8653","Lots of leesy, vanilla richness in this New World-style Chardonnay. It brims with mango, orange and cinnamon spice flavors. Will satisfy fans of this sweet, creamy approach.","White","Chardonnay","US",8653
"11193","This wine from the sought-after site opens with spice, salty brine and a light imprint of acidity. It shows prominent preserved lemon and crisp green apple notes, as well as more developed layers of peach. The oak is well integrated and helpful to the whole, adding texture and weight.","White","Chardonnay","US",11193
"99825","Aratás puts more bottle age on their Petite Sirah than most, and the extra maturity shows. Wonderful oak spices fill the aroma and extend into the fully ripe and richly fruity flavors of this big but beautifully sculpted wine. It has a lot of new oak influence and that is perfect to match the big body and monumental tannins that give the wine such impact.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",99825
"9225","This ripe wine is full of citrus fruit, gooseberry flavors and fully integrated acidity. The crisp background is beginning to fill out and soften. Attractive freshness contrasts with the rich fruits and spice aftertaste.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",9225
"38435","Slightly dusty oak tones of dill, vanilla and sweet spice accentuate the maturity of this barrel-aged Chardonnay. It's a full bodied, densely textured wine with lingering flavors of dried apple and pear. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",38435
"103349","Dijon clones notwithstanding, this wine is buttery and oaky, emphasizing the flavors of barrel fermentation (in 40% new French oak). Apart from that, it shows moderate acids and a little heat in the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",103349
"93959","Intense aromas suggest white rose petals, stone fruit and honey. The rich palate offers ripe yellow peach, apricot, candied ginger and clove with just enough freshness to keep it well balanced.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",93959
"78266","Four qualities distinguish this Barbera. It's bone dry, high in acidity, rigidly tannic and rich in cherries. By itself, it's rustic and old-fashioned. But it's the kind of wine the oldtimers drank with the cheese, meat, bread and sauce, and so should you. Like any respectable Barbera, it will age for decades, softening and sweetening without necessarily gaining complexity.","Red","Barbera","US",78266
"19035","This shows petrol, honey and brie cheese rind notes on the nose, and is quite creamy once sipped, yet the edges are punctuated with orange peel bitterness. The tartness ensures cellaring potential, so drink 2018–2025.","White","Riesling","US",19035
"62029","Here's an average-quality Merlot. It's properly dry and firmed up with rich tannins. Yet it's a bit soft, with herbs and oak framing modest cherry and currant flavors.","Red","Merlot","US",62029
"70709","Here's a clean, dry, light-bodied white wine with green-apple and celery aromas and flavors that are very mild. The first sip is crisp and refreshing, and it turns softer and leaner on the finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",70709
"45631","After the sulfur smell blows off, this wine remains tough in acids and tannins.","Red","Dolcetto","US",45631
"105581","This light-bodied wine has a pale pink Provençal color but quite a bit of fruit flavor. It feels soft on the palate and tastes lightly sweet.","Rosé","Rosé","US",105581
"50226","Cream and spice aromas lead to a palate accented by peach and lees flavors that stretch out the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",50226
"71027","This is a creamy and lush expression, with soft sweetness in the form of peach nectar and almond. The effervescence is soft and foamy.","White","Glera","Italy",71027
"28216","This nicely balanced, medium-bodied wine has fresh, bright flavors, a firm mouthfeel and enough complexity to demand attention. Unlike so many heavy, slightly sweet red blends this one is moderate and appetizingly dry.","Red","Red Blend","US",28216
"66374","This has aromas of medicinal herb, red berry and a whiff of adhesive bandage that carry over to the palate along with mature apple and a hint of orange zest. Bitter almond closes the finish.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",66374
"18062","Appealing aromas of cocoa, herb, cherry and barrel spice lead to full fruit flavors. Burly slightly drying tannins give it a firm squeeze.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",18062
"68357","A pure expression of Merlot, this round, delicious wine opens with aromas of blueberry, blackberry, leather, licorice and tobacco. The juicy, smooth palate doles out fleshy black cherry, plum, mint, menthol and anise. Soft, velvety tannins give it a creamy texture. Drink through 2019.","Red","Merlot","Italy",68357
"45143","Delicate aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit and citrus present themselves to the nose while the fun, simple palate shows green pear and a hint of lime. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy close.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",45143
"90134","A blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah, Damis is a plump, jammy wine with bold aromas of strawberry and blackberry preserves, spice and toasted nut. It's an easy-drinking wine with a fresh, almost sour note on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",90134
"89437","Claret is the old-fashioned word for Bordeaux, but it has no legal meaning in the U.S. This Cabernet-based wine contains some Syrah, which gives a smoked meat or bacon note to the blackberries and black currants. It's delicious, if a little sweet.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",89437
"26417","Intense aromas of dried rose, leather, truffle and crushed berry lead the nose. The ripe, forward palate offers crushed black cherry, wild raspberry, cinnamon white pepper and sage alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2015–2022.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",26417
"93032","This domaine—situated at a higher altitude than most Corsican vineyards—produces wines with an extra zest of freshness. This bottling is crisp and tight yet has great swathes of red fruit and balanced acidity. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",93032
"89425","A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Merlot, this is a landmark bottling because many years ago it demonstrated that great international-style wines could be made elsewhere in Italy—not only in Tuscany. A celebrated star of the Veneto, this oak-aged red offers enormous density and intensity, with soft, velvety layers and bright aromas of red fruit, spice and dried sage. The finish is characterized by savory, herbal notes that are fresh and tantalizing.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",89425
"71833","The aromas bring notes of cream, padded butter and summer squash. The palate is rich and creamy, made in a full-bodied style that brings plenty of appeal.","White","Chardonnay","US",71833
"63474","The AVA brings a nice mix of fruit and soil into the wine. Fruit flavors run to plum and wild cherry, with (presumably) barrel aging adding gentle suggestions of milk chocolate, drifting into lightly herbal tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63474
"99481","High toned cranberry and red cherry aromas mix with hot chili peppers on the nose. High acidity keeps the cranberry, pomegranate and cherry flavors bright on the palate, with spicy notes and taut tannins giving nuance. Black cherry, licorice and clove lead the spicy finish, which leans a bit hot.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",99481
"65754","Gently herbaceous with a character that also allows room for a creamy texture, this is a refreshing wine with a crisp edge, always in moderation. Drink this fresh wine now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",65754
"8820","This winery was originally developed as a Cabernet specialist, and the regular 2012 bottling is another fine success. Briery, herbal shadings frame blackberry fruit, while the finish features a mouthwatering combination of mocha, dark fruit and lingering tannins. Drink this medium-bodied Cabernet now through 2025.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",8820
"95894","Brick red in color, this is a clear, clean expression of tar and ripe red cherry and raspberry fruit that's medium bodied and layered, popping at the finish with a spectacularly intense imprint of oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95894
"3054","Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3054
"50989","An intriguing, eye-opening blend of Grenache and Pinot Noir, this shows stewed strawberry, black cardamon, clove and wet slate on the nose. Flavors of deeply ripe strawberries mesh with black pepper, soy, potpourri and dried purple flowers on the juicy but tight palate.","Red","Red Blend","US",50989
"10217","Soft, warm and lightly tannic, this has an herbaceous character. Its fresh acidity balances its black currant flavor. It is fragrant, fruity and mature; ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",10217
"2288","Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough. Flavors of bell pepper, pizza sauce and oregano finish without the ripeness that should be present in a high-end 2011 RDD.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",2288
"91756","A blend of Carricante and Catarratto from vineyards plated 600 meters above sea level on the slopes of Mount Etna, Quota 600 is among Sicily's best white wines. Compact, tonic and streamlined, it does a beautiful job of presenting delicate floral and peach fruit aromas against an austere backdrop of crushed stone and talcum powder.","White","White Blend","Italy",91756
"33668","From the marquee vineyard just down the road, known better for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this ZInfandel has 5% Petite Sirah blended in. Combined, they offer earthy and floral elements on the nose before a juicy palate of red fruit enters. A touch of olive plays off the bittersweet finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",33668
"50300","An imperfect combination of 35% Negroamaro, 33% Primitivo and 33% Sangiovese, it's structured and slightly spicy but otherwise simple without much in the way of fruit.","Red","Red Blend","US",50300
"40177","This bright rosé from central Italy opens with aromas of cranberry and raspberry, followed by white almond and pressed flower. There's enough power and determination here to pair with roast chicken or vegetarian pasta.","Rosé","Rosé","Italy",40177
"26949","This savory Zin screams its varietal identity with a blast of pepper, nutmeg and clove that accompanies ripe blackberries, wild cherries, mulberries and smoky oak. The wine feels very soft and lightly elegant in the mouth, but fully dry. Perfect for restaurant wine lists.","Red","Zinfandel","US",26949
"82257","Production of the winery's most affordable red wine has zoomed up, with six different grapes—principally Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah—comprising the blend. It's a kitchen sink wine, pleasant but wholly generic in flavor, with a saline edge to the brambly red fruits.","Red","Red Blend","US",82257
"93046","This is still a young wine, with its ripe red fruits and black cherry flavors. The taste of licorice mingles with the fruit and balances with the smoky toast flavors. It's a rich wine that needs time, so drink from 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",93046
"74699","Here's a bright and sharp rendition of Cabernet Sauvignon (and 10% Merlot) with background notes of wild berries, forest floor and vanilla bean. The wine is tonic and lean with a determined blast of freshness on the close.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",74699
"15458","This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",15458
"99620","Elusive on the nose, this wine opens in the glass to show an intensity of chocolate amidst soft layers of black fruit, leather and pepper. The full-bodied texture is soft and generously ripe.","Red","Zinfandel","US",99620
"101907","A wine of intense acidity, this Verdejo, usually native to Spain, is sourced from relatively cool Clarksburg and has a salty, herbal quality to it, more fennel and cedar than tropical fruit, and a light, woody finish.","White","Verdejo","US",101907
"34966","Riding the delicate balance between ripeness and freshness, Adam Comartin's bottling shows warm white peach and toasted cashew on the nose alongside sea salt, tangerine pith, white jasmine, light honey and apple crème brûlée aromas. Ripe stonefruit flavors are deftly cut by sizzling acidity on the palate.","White","Chardonnay","US",34966
"44346","A generously ripe touch of apricot hovers before blending in with ripe Amalfi lemon and Granny Smith notes. Brightness and light seem to be at the core of this wine. The mousse is exuberant and flavors are brisk and urgent. Subtle autolysis provides a calm backdrop to all the lively, fruity action in the foreground. The balance is harmonious and flavors are brisk, fruity and pure The long-lasting finish conveys seriousness. Lovely now, the wine will evolve with bottle age. Drink 2017–2022.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","England",44346
"54018","This vineyard selection brings a bit more concentration and complexity than the other Coelho Pinots. The mixed fruits offer flavors of red candy and Orange Crush, with a touch of the region's earthy tannins. Just 20% went into new oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54018
"9943","This Rhône-style blend is rich and forward, with blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam flavors. A sweet, spicy flavor is pretty much all you get.","Red","G-S-M","US",9943
"19685","This marches in a completely opposite direction from the oaky, fruity, buttery style of modern Chardonnay. It's bone dry and minerally, with mouthwatering acidity and traces of oranges and limes. The minerality is like a lick of cold steel. What a great food wine at a great price, although production was a paltry 230 cases.","White","Chardonnay","US",19685
"96847","Ripe and richly fruity, this fragrant Doublet family wine offers spice, floral aromas and a crisp texture. It is well balanced, lively and ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",96847
"105892","Already six years old, this is in full bloom, offering aromas of jammy red and black fruit sprinkled with cocoa and iron. Flavors show purity and richness, with barrel influences dialed back.","Red","Syrah","US",105892
"102443","At first, the bouquet seems dense and tinged with a mild lactic note, but that moves on rather quickly. The flavor profile of banana, pear and apple is perfectly fine, while the finish is a bit lean.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",102443
"79368","A bouquet of golden apple and honeydew melon sets the scene for flavors of melon, lilac, and barely ripe golden apple. It is smooth on the palate, with fruit and floral notes playing off each other. The lengthy, sophisticated finish wraps up on a nice bright note.","White","Chardonnay","Israel",79368
"74359","This is an impressive blend of 45% Merlot with 25% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah from Stagecoach Vineyard and 10% Biale Zinfandel. It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many.","Red","Red Blend","US",74359
"65094","From a small property next to Jean-Luc Baldès's Clos Triguedina, Labrande produces a firm while accessible Malbec. It has richness, solid tannins, dark coffee and blueberry flavors. The end shows density and medium-term aging potential.","Red","Malbec","France",65094
"60773","This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot smells 100% Chilean, meaning there's green tobacco, olive, eucalyptus and earthy berry aromas draped all over the bouquet. A linear, zesty palate ranks as fresh, while lightly oaked red currant and plum flavors finish with spice and vanilla notes along with tomatoey acidity.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",60773
"104754","Pristine is the word that comes to mind. Also pure, transparent, lucid. It's bone dry and crisp and elusively complex in citrus, pear, mineral and floral aromas and flavors, subtlely enhanced with oak. Only 45 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.","White","Viognier","US",104754
"75591","Made of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Malvasia Bianca, this opens with red-skinned fruit and an earthy underbrush aromas. The fresh, straightforward palate evokes red cherry and chopped herb, framed by smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",75591
"42152","This wine is marked by dry tannins and is smoky and toasty, with little sign of fruit. While it will soften, it will stay somewhat tough.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",42152
"26366","Lightly tannic, this wine is about red cherry and blueberry fruits, along with hints of banana. Fresh and fruity, it offers a balance of acidity and tannins at the end. Drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",26366
"73575","An earthy touch of freshly turned soil clings to the pure apple note on the nose. On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow. This is a real experience and a celebration of site and variety. Hoard this if you can. Gorgeous and fresh now, but far too young. Drink 2022–2040.","White","Riesling","France",73575
"56563","This huge, ripe wine is packed with sweet fruit and a sense of structure. It is concentrated and intense and has good aging potential for the next four or five years.","White","White Blend","Italy",56563
"76315","Though labeled Willamette Valley, this is single vineyard Chehalem Mountains AVA fruit. Smooth, ripe and buttery, from sniff to swallow, it's loaded with Satsuma orange, Meyer lemon and pink-grapefruit flavors. The acids snap and the finish lingers, with a streak of vanilla and a slight sensation of heat.","White","Chardonnay","US",76315
"68119","Spiced plum, truffle, new leather, coconut and oak aromas lead the nose. Taut and tightly wound, the palate offers dried cherry, tart cranberry, espresso, anise and sage notes. Give the tannins another few years to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",68119
"105439","Rubbery aromas and a pasty note are on equal footing with plum and cherry scents. This is choppy and mildly astringent in feel, with narrow plum and raspberry flavors that finish quick and with pinching tannins.","Red","Merlot","Spain",105439
"75767","Earthy aromas include new leather, scorched soil, wild berry and a touch of funky game. On the robust palate, grilled sage, tobacco and licorice add depth to a core of fleshy wild cherry along a backbone of raspy tannins and searing alcohol. Drink after 2018.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",75767
"57110","Fresh, honest fruitiness that's tasty but not sweet, a tangy texture and medium body add up to very refreshing, mouth-cleansing sort of wine. The flavors resemble canteloupe and honeydew melons, but there's a good crisp feeling like Granny Smith apples, too.","White","Verdejo","US",57110
"95127","This crisp, clean wine has both fruit and acidity in just the right proportions. With lively acidity and hint of herbal and citrus flavors, it is a fine apéritif style. The aftertaste continues this bright and lively character.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",95127
"77233","Herbal aromas of olive and sweaty leather require patience. In the mouth, this is firm and acidic, with a spiky feel and peppery flavors of mint and spice that outmuscle the wine's fruit component. A dry, acid-driven finish is the close.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",77233
"25151","Aromas of crushed violet, iris, baking spice, leather and vineyard dust take center stage. The vibrant palate offers layers of crunchy red cherry, juicy raspberry, licorice and thyme alongside a firm backbone of noble tannins and fresh acidity. Hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2025.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",25151
"77212","This is the second vintage of this wine from the winery's young estate property. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, it's locked up at present with aromas of coffee, graphite, cherry, barrel spices and licorice. The dark chocolate and cherry flavors are tightly coiled and the lightly grippy tannins are wound up. There's lot of promise there but it needs time to be realized. It will be best after 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",77212
"79807","Fresh fruits, flavors of bright red berries, with juicy plums and a wild acidity. This is a wine for drinking now, approachable with a sweet, soft aftertaste.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",79807
"96447","Concentrated but one-dimensional, this features aromas of stewed fruit, fig, almond, nail polish and coconut, all of which follow through to the warm, monolithic palate. It's already extremely evolved, and lacks vibrancy and complexity.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",96447
"103982","Full bodied and plush, with supple, velvety tannins that frame cassis fruit. At 60% Shiraz, it's mostly about the fruit, but the 30% Cabernet and 10% Merlot add herbal, tomato-like elements. Drink now–2018.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",103982
"39961","Waxy, dusty apple and oak aromas reflect the 30% Sémillon, but this is mostly Chardonnay in quantity, style, feel and flavors. Salty melon, tropical notes and nicely laid-out oak flavors turn a touch bitter on a weighty but healthy finish. Drink this classy white blend through 2018.","White","White Blend","Argentina",39961
"80431","A rich style of rosé that has some wood aging and a full-bodied texture. Strawberry fruit flavors dominate. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",80431
"90163","This wine is supremely pretty, inviting in rose petals and violets. Sourced from Oakville Ranch Vineyard and Vineyard Georges III in Rutherford, it deserves its own bottling. Generously soft and complex, it offers a deftness of black cherry, clove and cedar married expertly together.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90163
"70225","Fragrant blue flower, spiced plum, new leather and Mediterranean herb aromas meld together. The elegant almost ethereal palate offers succulent red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and a hint of nutmeg framed in supple polished tannins. Drink through 2022.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",70225
"65368","This is a light and informal Ripasso with plenty of sweet spice followed by bright blueberry and raspberry. There's a touch of sweetness in the mouth and vanilla bean flavors appear on the close.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",65368
"83788","Pressed plum and dried berry meet with leather on the nose, becoming a bit musty over time. The dusty flavors carry to the sip, where underripe bramble provides tang but little else.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",83788
"57572","Elegant and fragrant, this opens with inviting scents of wisteria, jasmine and white peach. The foaming palate doles out green apple, yellow pear and citrus zest alongside tiny, persistent bubbles that give it a bright, creamy texture.","White","Glera","Italy",57572
"89167","A rich, ripe, warm wine, smoothed with soft tannins. The open, generous fruit character is given an extra edge with textured wood and acidity. A black, tarry aftertaste adds further complexity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",89167
"23281","This opens with pretty floral aromas that recall violet and iris together with a whiff of dark berry. The bright palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed cranberry, clove and dried anise. Smooth tannins and zesty acidity give it an easy-drinking quality so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",23281
"77729","Produced entirely with organically farmed Sangiovese, this earthy, structured red opens with classic aromas of ripe berry, fragrant blue flowers, leather and a whiff of forest floor. The savory palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside big, velvety tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",77729
"7805","Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs.","Red","Syrah","US",7805
"90415","Marked by excessive oak, with toasty-sweet caramel flavors dominating the ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors. Nice tannins, though. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90415
"12451","Produced from vines planted in 1900 (MCM in Roman numerals), this is a serious, major wine. It is so concentrated with its dark tannins yet never loses its elegant balance between fruit and structure. Dense dusty dry tannins are layered with black plum and damson flavors giving a surprising freshness to a wine that is still young. Drink from 2022.","Red","Tannat","France",12451
"99640","From 100% Azal grapes, this is a rich style of Vinho Verde, ripe and citric, touched by minerality. Yeasty aromas go through the palate but don't detract from the ripe final fruit.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",99640
"46450","Ripe both with the generous tannins and the juicy fruit, this is a wine with good potential. There is plenty of acidity to bring out the crisp character of this attractive wine. It will be ready from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",46450
"99728","This is the inaugural release from this winery. It opens with aromas of raspberries, herbs and cherries, showing just a touch of volatility. The fruit and barrel flavors are ripe and generous, lingering on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",99728
"24455","Aromas of resin, dark spice and black-skinned berry lead the nose. The lively straightforward palate shows espresso and dried black cherry alongside vigorous acidity.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",24455
"90080","Here's a simple, straightforward Cabernet Sauvignon from northern Italy with an attractively low price tag and lively aromas of cherry, chocolate and spice. It shows rich, dense texture as well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",90080
"44280","Thin aromas of cherries and oregano show on the nose of this simple but quaffable bottling. The palate combines fruit punch and candied cherries with a hint of more herbs.","Red","Merlot","US",44280
"27889","California winemaker Nick Goldschmidt reaches back to his New Zealand roots for this bottling. It's a finely balanced mélange of grapefruit, cut grass and fig notes carried by medium body and a soft, appealing finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",27889
"59869","Very pure notes of conference pear charm on the nose and palate, which is taut and slender. A citric verve makes for liveliness. With some air, subtler notes of pepper appear alongside gossamer-like phenolics. Typical for the 2014 vintage this is light but also clean with subtle, earthy spice. No fewer than 17 co-planted varieties from an old vineyard go into this. Savor that pepper.","White","White Blend","Austria",59869
"48615","Give this Syrah a good decant to take the edge off the fresh tannins and acids. It's a gritty, resilient wine notable for its wealth of blackberry, black cherry, currant, beef jerky, anise and pepper flavors, accented with sweet, smoky, caramelized oak.","Red","Syrah","US",48615
"103358","This is a supple, forward and pleasantly drinkable wine. If it is to be criticized it's that it lacks precision and focus. The fruit flavors are a diffuse mélange of cherry, berry and plum, leading to a chalky finish that tastes of tartaric acid with a splash of chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103358
"37052","While this wine has generous swathes of ripe fruit, it also has plenty of the dark tannins that are found in the northern part of the appellation. It is dense in character, packed equally with concentrated tannins and with red-berry fruits. The wine will age well; drink from 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",37052
"2747","Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now.","White","Riesling","US",2747
"88472","Rich and concentrated, this wine is produced from vines on hills above the Pinhão valley. It offers firm tannins and ripe black-plum fruits. Full bodied and ripe, it is also young with new wood flavors and a dark structure. This wine will repay aging. Drink from 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",88472
"67477","This is an easy expression of Nero d'Avola, and it would pair with roasted ham or cheese ravioli in meat sauce. Bright cherry and blueberry notes come with a touch of bitter almond.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",67477
"83962","Stony fresh aromas of lime and grapefruit are light and clean. This blend of Garnacha Blanca, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc is steady on the palate. Flavors of dry lime and wet stones are slightly pithy, while this finishes firm and dry.","White","White Blend","Spain",83962
"22160","Grassy aromas of red currant suggest cowhide. This has a grabby narrow palate with green-leaning raspberry flavors. Overall, this is fresh and wiry in style, with a choppy, mildly tannic finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",22160
"14723","Winemaker Blair Fox loves this single-clone bottling, and for good reason. It's intensely dark in color but not overextracted, with soil, eucalyptus, black plum and baking spice aromas. Rounded strawberry and raspberry fruit shows on the medium-bodied palate, with star anise and white pepper accents.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14723
"4078","A solid Zin for everyday drinking. A little rough and thin, but dry and spicy, with berry, currant and teriaki flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",4078
"71171","Despite overriding aromas of spunky, candied berry fruits and wet dog fur, this rubbery, acidic blend is pretty good. Saucy, fresh berry, cherry and tomato flavors finish briny and savory, with moderate heat and burn.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",71171
"71989","Sangiovese (with 10% Merlot) forms a solid base for bright aromas of red cherry, cola, leather, tobacco and rum cake in this blend. These two varieties work well together to produce a soft, velvety feel with a touch of ripe fruit on the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",71989
"73537","The aromas of earth, char and dark berries are alluring. The flavors are rich but never lose their deftness.","Red","Syrah","US",73537
"36513","Among top-flight Northern Rhône, this has to be considered a solid value. Hints of melon and gingery spice mark the nose, while the palate is filled out by pear and melon notes. It's full bodied and silky in texture, finishing with echoes of melon and marshmallow. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",36513
"66125","Whiffs of herbs and green florals persist from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with ripe white-peach flavor, but blossomy and bright with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long with a delicately lacy sweetness.","White","Riesling","US",66125
"62664","This blend of Syrah, Malbec, Grenache and Merlot seems intended for contemplative consumption, with its baked-plum flavor accented in tar and cigar. Quite ripe and full bodied, it packs a punch, with swathes of toasty oak on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",62664
"35125","Generic, mealy, bland and flat banana aromas and flavors. Not so bad that you can't drink it but impossible to get excited about.","White","Viognier","Argentina",35125
"94887","Full-bodied and earthy, this opens with funky aromas of game, new leather and a hint of barnyard. The hearty palate deliver crushed black cherry, baking spices and sweet vanilla. Ripe and round, this is already evolved so enjoy soon.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",94887
"26749","Pie cherry and raspberry fruit flavors open, with gentle barrel notes of toast and caramel. Balanced and light, this has a pleasing elegance, though a quick finish suggests a lack of depth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26749
"53585","A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.","White","White Blend","Spain",53585
"64009","Compact berry and plum aromas set up a solid, nice palate with nectarine and raspberry flavors. This is very drinkable and easygoing; the finish is mellow but propped up by core acidity.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",64009
"49942","Warmth and mocha greet you, but dig as you might it's hard to settle on any particular fruit aromas or flavors. There is, however, plenty of cola, rooty flavors and baked characteristics. Finishes almost hot, with sticky tannins and a sprig of green. Drink now through 2009.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",49942
"49075","Sourced from the Hightower vineyard on Red Mountain, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is firm, full, tannic and dense. It compares favorably with wines from the iconic Klipsun vineyard just down the road. A thick mix of smoke, coffee, cassis, herb and dark chocolate swirls up from the glass and on through the palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",49075
"49518","A faint whiff of herbs linger from nose to palate, adding earthy complexity to tart sour-cherry and cranberry flavors. It's crisp and invigorating, but a little restrained in character. Finishes on a pleasantly tannic, brambly note.","Red","Merlot","US",49518
"58151","Opaque to the eye, this is rich, heady and full of inky blackberry aromas and notes of graphite, balsam wood, tobacco and coconut. A lush, mile-deep palate offers chocolaty flavors of blackberry, roasted meat and salt. Ripe black-fruit flavors dominate a lush finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",58151
"47312","From the first whiff—laden with tangy notes of herb, leaf and spicy cranberry fruit—this announces itself as classic Oregon Pinot Noir. At 14+% it's ripe enough to build a core of sweet cherry fruit; but it is not shy about expressing the herbal side of the grape, and does so to good effect. It's a vivacious, expressive wine that offers a rich range of flavors, well beyond the basic fruit and barrel approach of too many wineries.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47312
"65413","This pale, clean wine shimmers like a diamond in the glass. The nose is a shape-shifter, jumping from tropical elements of honeydew, bubble gum and guava to sharper-cut grass tones. It's dynamic on the palate too, proving both ripe with stone-fruit flesh and sour with chopped herbs, green pepper and grass. A touch of crushed rocks rounds it out nicely.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",65413
"74559","A disappointing blend of wine sourced from Mornington and Yarra, this is a bit pale in color, with a Sherried edge to the fruit and some astrigency on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",74559
"47866","Dried red-cherry aromas meet with turned earth, concentrated rose and intriguing carnation notes on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard on the northern tip of the appellation. The well-woven flavors included tart cherry and baking spices of vanilla and nutmeg, all presented on a relatively lightweight body.","Red","Grenache","US",47866
"88894","Deep black plum aromas are enhanced by soy and crushed graphite on the nose of this bottling. It lands on the palate softly, with tangy plum and turned loam flavors, its tannins sticky and persistent.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88894
"53452","This estate-grown wine has a really fresh character. With red-currant and red-cherry flavors, it has a juicy fruity style that is ready to drink. Light and perfumed, it is delicious now.","Red","Gamay","France",53452
"62165","A wisp of smoke lends a sultry tone to fresh pear in this dry, supple wine. It's ripe and rich on the palate, but maintains the lean, steely acidity ubiquitous to this vintage. Finishes long with rolling mineral notes.","White","Riesling","Germany",62165
"31982","Thick and rich in black sugarplum, this memorable Pritchard Hill-grown red is lovely and bold, velvety in texture with a softness to the firm, integrated tannin. Dried herb and spice provide memorable seasonings amidst a larger theater of dark chocolate, leather, clove and pepper.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",31982
"20437","There's a tropical element to this Cab, which otherwise traffics in bright red cassis and cranberry. The tannins are still resolving but tend to the softer side, woven tightly through to the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",20437
"15098","Full-bodied and lushly textured, this delicious Gigondas is a blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. It's fragrant with hints of wildflowers and black cherries, but adds enough savory hints of black olive and coffee to avoid being a simple fruit bomb. A bit warm, but impressive; for early drinking.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",15098
"35273","This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35273
"11634","Drink this while it is still showing its youthful fruit. Black and purple berries abound, with excellent depth, some herbal grace notes and a spicy, lengthy finish.","Red","Syrah","US",11634
"25179","This straightforward Dolcetto has red berry and spice aromas and raspberry jam, clove and orange zest flavors. With its flexible tannins, it's ready to be enjoyed soon.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",25179
"52970","The Yiddish word zaftig describes this Merlot perfectly. It's fleshy, with a soft, fat mouthfeel framing ultraripe cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, anise and sandalwood flavors that finish jammy-sweet and spicy.","Red","Merlot","US",52970
"51574","Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors. Finishes firm, tight and a bit clipped and choppy. A reflection of 2008's tough conditions.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",51574
"75622","This is still closed and extremely tannic but opens with aromas of underbrush, mature berry, tilled soil and game. The palate offers dried cherry, grilled sage and a leathery note alongside dry, raspy tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",75622
"42112","Dark in color, this delivers black fruit aromas along with a toasty note. While it's slightly hollow in the middle, it's wide around the edges, tasting of mossy blackberry and herb. The finish is toasty, big and grabby.","Red","Merlot","Chile",42112
"47531","This is 100% varietal and aged in 60% new French oak, offering primary aromas of blackberry, black cherry, and savory herbs accented by woodspice. The fruit flavors are ripe and focused with firm tannins and a pleasing lick of cranberry-like acidity. Best after 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47531
"20962","A miracle for Grateful Dead fans who have matured into wine, there's lots to like in this red blend that's got bright, friendly cherry fruit, a lick of spice and surprising sophistication. It's medium in weight, with a shock of silky berry fruit on the finish. The blend is 60% Zinfandel, 23% Petite Sirah, 11% Barbera and 6% Sangiovese. Pair it with mushroom pizza or burgers. Jerry would approve.","Red","Red Blend","US",20962
"12651","This is a beautifully aromatic wine with toast and yellow fruits mingling easily together. It is ripe while also light to taste, a crisp burst of acidity giving the wine a fine lift. Yellow fruits, citrus and toast play together in this attractive wine that is ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",12651
"96830","One in a series of field-blend wines from the producer, this comes from a 100-year old parcel within the Gaivosa estate. Packed with both tannins and rich, jammy fruit, it's a serious wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",96830
"73412","Light in color and lilting floral aromas of rose, this is an inviting cool-climate Pinot Noir swirling in equal parts strawberry and spice, subtle and sophisticated.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73412
"100423","Nobody ever said Argentina was Pinot Grigio country. This wine is yellow in color, with aromas of haystack and wheat. There's acidity to keep it upright, but flavors of briny citrus do little to bring it around.","White","Pinot Grigio","Argentina",100423
"105188","This is an innocuous, flowery and lemony white wine priced to sell that offers a creamy texture amid a light body and soul. For picnics and larger gatherings, it'll represent well.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",105188
"36071","This weighty Malbec is more rough than refined, but what's here is decent. The nose is round and full of plum and berry aromas, while there's a full blast of berry fruit along with detectable oak on the palate. The finish is basic and clean, with some buttery oak on the very back.","Red","Malbec","Chile",36071
"79453","Integrating the buttered toast and caramel notes of new oak with the underlying wine, this is is a Chardonnay of classy California dimensions. Despite a cool vintage, the grapes achieved remarkable ripeness, with flavors suggesting oranges and spicy, creamy papayas, while bright acidity gives it all a wakeup call of zest.","White","Chardonnay","US",79453
"30302","The Buzet co-op's top brand, this is big, powerful and rich. It is dominated by blackberry jelly and sweet plums, as well as firm tannins. The palate is weighty, solid, maybe missing freshness but certainly giving good intensity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",30302
"70447","A small percentage of Teroldego is added to this classic Valpolicella bend to give it a slightly darker color and smoother mouthfeel. On the nose, it offers bright cherry and blackberry aromas.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",70447
"101361","Sweet and simple, this soft wine has sugary berry and cola flavors.","Red","Red Blend","US",101361
"71759","Longoria brings a deft touch to this Pinot Grigio. The grapes were briefly fermented in tank, then bottled when the wine was only about four months old. The result is exceptionally fresh and lively, with tangy acidity brightening citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and white pepper flavors.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",71759
"45257","Plums, purple flowers and graphite characterize the nose on this wine from the producer that's now owned by the Foley family of wines. Spicy cherries and blackberries show on the palate long with pencil lead and hints of dried oregano.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45257
"42380","Savory aromas of black pepper, leather and sandalwood provide depth to the core mulberry fruit on this clonal selection. Rounded flavors of black plums and dark berries are lifted by sagebrush, dried ginger and Christmas spice on the palate that offers layers and layers of depth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",42380
"41525","Mature berry, new leather, spice and balsamic aromas lead the nose. The bold palate doles out baked cherry, black raspberry, white pepper, clove and grilled herb balanced by firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity. A tobacco note closes the finish. It's already almost accessible but will drink well for years. Drink 2017–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",41525
"45396","Earthy, field-like aromas include plum and currant. This Malbec shows tough, edgy tannins and toasty black-plum flavors. A bit of heat and burn is detectable on a bold, rugged finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",45396
"1110","An attractively fragrant rosé, this is very crisp and clean. It has lively raspberry and red currant flavors that are lightly touched by a herb note. A bright finish completes this refreshing wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",1110
"32476","This top-tier vineyard delivers gorgeous flavors. Big, juicy, rich and round, it piles on the fruit flavors—apples, pears, white peaches and lemons. All are balanced against each other and the supporting, natural acidity, finished with a frame of new-oak toast. Drink 2016 to 2028.","White","Chardonnay","US",32476
"11978","Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas that recall red berry, mint, tilled soil and a hint of game. The structured, elegant palate offers juicy wild cherry, clove, tobacco and a licorice note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. This will benefit from a little more aging. Drink 2016–2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",11978
"86756","Aromas of blackberry, strawberry and chocolate open for flavors of blackberry, Red Delicious apple peel, aniseed and vanilla. This wine is harmonious on the palate with understated tannins and breakthrough notes of summer peach on the finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","",86756
"28148","An impressively full wine, its ripe apricot flavors melding seamlessly into rich wood and concentrated flavors. The lemon acidity enlivens the ripe yellow fruits, leaving a rich final impression.","White","Chardonnay","France",28148
"51883","Even Brancott's entry-level Sauvignon Blanc is a solid effort, adding a hint of fumé character to its otherwise straightforward blend of stone and passion fruit. There might be a touch of residual sugar to give the impression of weight, but it's balanced by the tangy acids on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",51883
"72","Barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of Creamsicle and baking spice. The palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. It provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times.","White","Viognier","US",72
"15904","Easy-drinking and intensely structured, this is marked by streaks of red raspberry fruit that also reveal cedar and herb. Slightly floral on the nose, the wine has a softness despite its size.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15904
"61657","A small-production Grenache from 100-plus-year-old vines, this wine is dusty and fragrant with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors. Light in weight and easy to drink, the undercurrent whispers licorice.","Red","Grenache","US",61657
"92804","Aromas of black-skinned berry, tilled soil and cooking spice lead the nose. The savory juicy palate offers ripe black cherry, leather and black pepper alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",92804
"86962","This is a robust wine. It has big, thick tannins, and the dryness accentuates a slightly rustic character. The flavors are well developed and complex, with blackberries veering into currants and a touch of raisin.","Red","Zinfandel","US",86962
"35821","You'll love the fresh cherry, almond and cola notes this cheerful Sangiovese-Mammolo blend exhibits. There is a linear, genuine quality to its essence that makes it approachable, yet elegant. The mouthfeel is lean, smooth and imparts lingering toasted notes on the finish. Closed with a cool glass cork.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",35821
"71310","This single-vineyard wine has benefited from the warmth of 2015. It is rich, full bodied and veering towards tropical fruits. There is a contrast with the steely texture that keeps crispness in the wine. It is now balanced and ready to drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",71310
"67303","A seductive blend of Petite Sirah, Carignane, Zinfandel, Syrah, Barbera, Alicante Bouschet and Mourvèdre, this wine sourced from old-vine grapes conveys an old-world sensibility. Juicy berry pie and black pepper surround a soft, structured core, finishing with a sprinkling of cinnamon.","Red","Red Blend","US",67303
"76822","Clumsy and a bit chemical smelling, with a sticky, thick, candied palate housing bug juice berry flavors in front of a medicinal finish. Bulky, sweet and grabby red wine.","Red","Tannat","Uruguay",76822
"31522","White flowers, eucalyptus and a slight whiff of petrol greet the nose. In the mouth, it is all about green olive, white peach and green apple. The finish is soft and elegant.","White","Riesling","Serbia",31522
"73772","Pepper Bridge and Stoney Vine vineyards contribute equally to this 100% varietal wine. It's the barrel influence that shows through first, with woodspice followed by green herbs, coffee and dark plum. The palate is rich with focused coffee and dark fruit flavors that have a touch of astringency.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",73772
"40228","A heavy note of baking spices is found throughout those of fleshy red plum, brown sugar and sweet red licorice, finishing with mild dried herbs. The bracing acidity makes this a natural for the cheese course. Try with blue cheese.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",40228
"32713","There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach.","Red","Zinfandel","US",32713
"58","This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",58
"63786","Forceful oak creates aromas of creosote, shoe polish, raw wood grain and leathery berry. This is high in acid, and hence rather sharp. Tart, snappy plum and pie cherry flavors finish fresh and tangy, but angular.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",63786
"53406","This is a lush, heady wine that's full bodied and dry, with massive black cherry, red currant, bacon and cedar flavors. The tannins are thick but smooth, making the wine drinkable now, although it will certainly develop through 2020. There's a pleasant tartness throughout that makes it especially friendly with well-marbled beef.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",53406
"11163","Fresh-crushed red currant aromas mix with dried purple flowers and mocha on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are very evenly presented, ripe and round with black plum fruit and a touch of fig-laced balsamic vinegar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",11163
"31346","This pretty riserva from the up-and-coming Montecucco area of coastal Tuscany, which is located roughly between Bolgheri and Montalcino, shows deep nuances of cherry, blackberry and cassis, followed by notes of leather and tobacco. The palate is velvety and fresh.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",31346
"76695","The winemaker calls this a “more masculine wine: richer, bigger,” which almost understates the case. It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango. It's all liberally enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. Almost too much of a good thing, but saved by brisk acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76695
"33325","Woodsy and warm on the bouquet, this has cedary, toasty aromas augmenting notes of milk chocolate and berry fruit. It feels heavy, with berry, leather and herb influences. This is big and oaky on the finish.","Red","Syrah","Argentina",33325
"37590","This bottling from the San Francisco-based producer is about as Burgundian as California gets. Aromas of honeydew rinds, Meyer lemon pith and honeysuckle meet with briny chalk, chiseled marble and a touch of almond warmth on the nose. The extremely fresh, clean and chalky palate shows stunning texture as well as rounded lemon blossom, sea salt and the faintest butter flavor.","White","Chardonnay","US",37590
"14349","Rollat's Sophie occupies the entry-level rung on the ladder, behind the elegant and polished Rollat and the dense, compact and highly cellar-worthy Edouard. But Sophie is charming and accessible, a blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc that is elegant and bright. The fruit focus is on cranberry and raspberry, tart and well-defined, and the wine is immaculately clean. It's light and charming, but a perfect choice for autumnal foods.","Red","Red Blend","US",14349
"63126","This Mulderbosch red starts with upfront red currant, smoke and cherry aromas. On the palate, it's a layered treat of elegant, bright plum and cherry fruit flavors, buoyed by minerals and a mocha coffee spin. The finish is long and fruity. Smooth, ageable and ultimately appealing.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","South Africa",63126
"27766","Fresh lime and lemon aromas light up this crisp and tangy wine. The flavors are bright, the texture tight at first but it smooths out on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",27766
"55495","Done in a clean, quaffable style, this brings a mix of beet root, sassafras, amaro and brown sugar flavors into play, with a round, pleasantly fruity midpalate. It's a country wine, great for glugging.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55495
"30179","This is a fruity wine with contrasting wood-aging spice and high toastiness. It is still young with the acidity still prominent, so the two elements should blend well over the next few years to give a ripe, fruity wine. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",30179
"19321","The flavors of ripe yellow pear combine with a yeasty edge of herbal spice: there is a pleasantly bitter undertone and lots of freshness on a slender, yet expressive body.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",19321
"99351","This drily austere Zinfandel tastes like it hardly got ripe. It's tough in acids and green tannins, with mint and sour cherry candy flavors. Oak helps to provide richness, but the cold vintage has taken its toll.","Red","Zinfandel","US",99351
"76818","Maderized and stalky smelling, with a scratchy palate and grassy, pickled flavors that lean toward strawberry and raspberry.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",76818
"100452","Fresh, soft and fruity, this is brightened by a jammy red-fruit flavor and light acidity. It has a juicy character, with underlying attractive, gentle tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",100452
"33103","Made from fruit that was sourced entirely from the 1.5-acre estate vineyard, this limited-production, Dijon-clone-based Chardonnay captures the essence of the Abeja style. Complex, stylish and buttery, it's a striking, fruit-laden wine. The long, clean finish mixes a flavor of citrus rind with a streak of butterscotch.","White","Chardonnay","US",33103
"11941","Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",11941
"19497","This opens with aromas of underbrush, toasted nut and grilled herb. The extremely simple, abrupt palate offers suggestions of sour cherry and orange zest alongside brisk acidity.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",19497
"89256","Ruddy prune and balsamic vinegar notes on the nose contrast crisp, punchy black cherry and berry flavors in this Finger Lakes Zweigelt. It's velvety smooth on the palate, marked by persistent fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink now.","Red","Zweigelt","US",89256

"16144","This wine is fruity and soft, with hints of citrus and herbal flavors. Its acidity is bright and attractive. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",16144
"50649","Pear, vanilla and butter aromas are at the fore. The Sémillon blended in (11%) gives the palate added richness and heft.","White","Chardonnay","US",50649
"35299","Reyna is a top-notch Barbaresco and this vintage delivers extra soft and supple smoothness followed by dark concentration and excellent intensity. There are so many aromatic descriptors here: espresso, black fruit, licorice, root beer, tar, tobacco and more. Drink from 2015–2020.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",35299
"101228","This classically crafted, 100% Sangiovese offers varietal aromas of forest floor, freshly turned soil, dark berry and a whiff of violet. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper and aniseed alongside assertive tannins. It's still rather closed and needs a couple more years to open up. Drink 2017–2022.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",101228
"69325","Ripe boysenberry, root beer and mocha latte aromas make for a dynamic, delicious nose on this bottling from Foxen's seven-acre estate vineyard. The flavors range from black pepper and roasted meats to dried thyme, sagebrush and black licorice, all set against emerging tannins and a long, lingering finish.","Red","Syrah","US",69325
"72720","Made from 100% Pinot Noir grapes left for more than two years en tirage, this is a dark reddish-pink wine with an intensity of strawberry and raspberry that falls a tad flat midway through and into the finish. With a tiny amount of sugar, it veers slightly sweet.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72720
"79012","Sourced from a half dozen vineyards, it includes small amounts of Merlot and Cab Franc. Balanced and complete, it conveys blackberry, coffee and a smooth, vivid streak of caramel, with silky, delicious tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",79012
"16480","A vein of burnt sugar threads curiously from nose to finish in this dry full-bodied Pinot Gris. Sunny tangerine, pineapple and apricot flavors flood the midpalate, brightened by streak of lime acidity. A graceful balance of brawn and restraint, it should drink well through 2021.","White","Pinot Gris","US",16480
"17420","The wine has plenty of fruit, the right layers of tannin. And yet it seems one-dimensional—something that can happen with Touriga Nacional. The depth and complexity found in previous vintages of this wine are missing. So you get bold black fruits and a stylish structure in a wine that is almost ready to drink.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",17420
"66001","This wine is bold and brawny, defined by big, oaky tannin and concentrated weight. Fresh black cherry develops a candied quality in the glass, while an earthy undercurrent of minty forest adds complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66001
"65853","A big, ripe, voluptuous Zinfandel, packed with flavor. The deliciousness factor of blackberries, cherries, anise and dark chocolate comes at the cost of high alcohol, which limits the wine's elegance but makes it super-drinkable with the richest barbecue imaginable.","Red","Zinfandel","US",65853
"72841","Biondi-Santi performs exceptionally well in elegant vintages like 2006. This wine is balanced and fresh, with lingering notes of wild berry, white cherry, cola, spice and dark chocolate. Age this wine 10 years or more.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",72841
"54075","Layers of plush yellow peach and apricot flavors highlight this easy, crowd-pleasing kabinett. Sunny lemon acidity lends refreshment to the midpalate, cutting through all the ripeness and leading to a brisk finish. Drink now through 2019.","White","Riesling","Germany",54075
"103596","This multi-vineyard blend opens with light floral notes, hits the palate with spice, clove and pepper, then brings in cranberry and pie cherry fruit. Complex and racy, it will be best with additional cellaring.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103596
"28642","Balancing sweet wood and mineral-driven citrus character, this is elegant and stylish, showing peach and grapefruit flavors. The wood, so fine, acts as balance and support. Age for 5–6 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",28642

"7233","Aromas of mature black fruit, spearmint and espresso come with the barest whiff of earthy farmyard. The palate offers up black cherry, raspberry and black pepper accented with toast and espresso, all alongside assertive but drying tannins. It's forward and evolved with ideal drinking time 2015–2019.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",7233
"97720","Soapy, floral aromas are wan, with no distinct fruit notes. This feels heavy as it stumbles around aimlessly. Plum and peach flavors are adequate, while the finish is mildly bitter, with sugary cherry notes.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",97720
"93287","This elegant Cabernet Franc is drinking beautifully, just beginning to round out the hardness of youth. The wine has a firm and confident backbone, which seems to wrap the acids and tannins tightly together. The framework supports the crisp, clean, immaculately ripe fruit, with flavors of plum, cherry and red licorice. Just 25% new oak was used, adding a light toasty touch to the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",93287
"1224","Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",1224
"12095","Ripe, powerful red-cherry flavors are balanced with crisp acidity and a backbone of granite in this medium-bodied Pinot Noir. It's a fresh, forward wine, with firm, upright tannins and lingering nuances of licorice and dark toast.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",12095

"88344","Concentrated strawberry, black cherry, cinnamon-laced latte, licorice and mocha converge in an intriguing and beautiful nose from this legendary Zin winery. The structure is immediately apparent on the palate, framing smoked strawberry, oregano and dill flavors. It's full of plush, ripe fruit, but seemingly bone dry.","Red","Zinfandel","US",88344
"92692","Big, tight and tannic, this is a full-fledged dinner wine that needs to pair with a nice caloric veal shank or lasagna. It's made with 80% Syrah, so the color is almost black, the aromas are spicy and smoky and the flavors feature black cherry, espresso and dark chocolate. The texture is both mouth filling and a bit astringent due to hefty tannins.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",92692
"48051","A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",48051
"11049","White fruits and delicious soft acidity make this wine immediately attractive. It is rich and fresh at the same time, with just a touch of apple skin structure. The name of the wine refers to the Solutré rock which towers over the vineyards.","White","Chardonnay","France",11049
"21486","Sweet vanilla oak gives this full-bodied, tropical wine its signature, a luscious taste of fruit-forward approachability that risks becoming overdone. From Vine Hill Ridge Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, it exhibits the power and warmth of the vintage.","White","Chardonnay","US",21486
"7611","Star anise, forest floor, mature dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of menthol perfume this structured red. The taut, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and pipe tobacco flavors, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2027.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",7611
"27150","The Merlot certainly does its job here of smoothing out the Baga tannins. Together, they yield a soft, red fruit-flavored wine with minimal tannins and juicy acidity, adding a burst of flavor on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",27150
"84073","Lip-smacking is an inelegant yet apt word to describe the unctuousness of this nectar of honey, saffron and marmalade. It's delightfully rich and creamy, yet gorgeously balanced, seared by a razor's edge of lemon-lime acidity. It's an exceptional wine now, penetrating and persistent, but will surely delight for decades to come.","White","Riesling","Germany",84073
"79467","A blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this savory wine offers aromas of blue flower, spiced plum, nutmeg and a whiff of game. The fresh, easy palate delivers juicy blackberry, crushed raspberry and cranberry alongside ground pepper and a licorice note. Velvety tannins give it a smooth texture.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",79467
"34634","The blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 15% Malbec has well-balanced tannins and scents of black raspberry, vanilla and caramel. Sweet vanilla, cherry pie and blueberries are the predominant tastes.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Moldova",34634
"92947","An easy, fruity wine, this is full of blackberry and red currant flavors. Its fruitiness is tempered with a firm tannic core that gives a light structure.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",92947
"16551","A pitch-black color is a good indication of the power and concentration this old-vine Malbec has in store. Aromas of blackberry, fir forest and ink set up an over-the-top-rich palate, with heavy extraction and giant flavors of minty blackberry and chocolate. Pull out the knife and fork to cut through the deep, chocolaty finish. Drink now through 2017.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",16551
"6492","The wine tastes full of ripe fruits as well as acidity. A touch of bitter almond gives a hard edge to the otherwise fruity, apple and pear flavored wine. Drink from 2015 to give the wine some bottle age.","Sparkling","Portuguese Sparkling","Portugal",6492
"8297","This rich cream-textured blend of Chardonnay and Viognier evokes warming pastry notes of vanilla, caramel and crème brûlée. It's a dry full-bodied wine with soft acidity and accents of toast, smoke and orange peel.","White","White Blend","US",8297
"10990","A healthy 8% Petit Verdot gives added strength and color to this wine, while the 5% Merlot adds smooth, layered, velvety-rich texture. Bittersweet chocolate and wild mushroom play off each other's sweet-savory tension, balancing at the end.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",10990
"27585","This bright Barolo with fruit sourced from two of the most important crus in the Langhe area of Piedmont opens with ripe red fruit aromas with toasted almond, cola and exotic spice. The long finish shows elegant accents of mesquite and cedar wood.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",27585
"59850","A light mix of apple, jicama and pear fruit, bolstered with plenty of acidity, carries this medium-weight, unoaked Chardonnay. It's perfectly pleasant, but teeters on the edge of generic flavor neutrality.","White","Chardonnay","US",59850
"49986","Basic cherry and red plum aromas are simple and fresh. Feels tight and crisp on the tongue, with an average body and edgy flavors of strawberry and red plum. Lightly oaked and hollow on the finish, with juicy acidity.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",49986
"88951","Despite the huge weight of fruit and accompanying structure, this is a stylish wine. It's impressively dense, concentrated and solid. At the same time, the juicy black fruits give a generous, full-in-the-mouth character. Drink this very fine wine from 2022.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",88951
"89743","Flat on the nose, then almost identical on the palate, this blend of Malbec, Syrah and Bonarda tastes grassy, lightly green and weedy. Cherry and berry flavors are weak. Tasted twice with similar results.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",89743
"58107","Smoke, candlewax and lemon zest lend savory tones to fresh lemon and apple flavors in this brisk off-dry wine. It's piercingly tart with a hit of lime acidity on the midpalate, but a waxy richness adds body and mouthfeel. The moderately long finish carries a hint of honeysuckle perfume.","White","Riesling","US",58107
"7452","Cool mint, blueberry and raisin aromas are lush and smooth, but charred oak is roaring loud on the nose of this dry-farmed Syrah. Punchy, short acidity makes the mouthfeel abrupt. Dark chocolate and ripe berry flavors end with hard-spiced blackberry and an everlasting burnt-oak character.","Red","Syrah","Chile",7452
"91630","A smooth and ripe wine that is rich in fruit as well as tannins. It has red berry flavors, a direct line in acidity and a texture that brings out both minerality from the limestone soil and dark fruit tannins. Drink from 2014.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",91630
"60040","Jon Martinez, who arrived in Washington barely six years ago, is knocking the ball out of the park. Improving with each new release, he has locked in a stellar collection of vineyards, and made Rhône-style wines his focus. This is a revelation. Pure berries, cassis, rock, earth, licorice, and a hint of baking spices. Gorgeous.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",60040
"6431","Nice black cherry fruit powers the nose, with just the barest hints of stem and root. Firm fruit is buttressed by tart acids, and the middle opens up sweetly, adding flavors of cocoa and coffee. —P.G.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",6431
"86672","Like all the Duval wines, this is amply structured. Cedar and vanilla notes frame dark fruit flavors in this blend of 51% Shiraz, 30% Grenache and 19% Mourvèdre. Its full bodied, with a long, dusty finish. Drink now–2022.","Red","G-S-M","Australia",86672
"36546","Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36546
"84132","A finely structured wine, this has a rich, juicy black-currant flavor and a solid, tannic core. It has weight and a dark, firm presence, and a smooth herbal character that highlights the wood aging. This should age for five years or more.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",84132
"27309","Despite its youth this is quickly peaking in flavor. It's light but interesting, with rosewater, red apple and strawberry flavors. Tannins are soft and there's a suggestion of saddle leather. It offers plenty of enjoyment for a Pinot at this price.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27309
"78252","A whole new generation of Italian rosé is finally gaining the attention it deserves. This is an exceptionally fresh and clean wine that would pair with smoked salmon, fish carpaccio or insalata di mare.","Rosé","Rosé","Italy",78252
"5845","From the Canadian Okanagan, this stylish, well-balanced wine offers a focused mix of flavors—cola, cherry, tobacco and wet stone in particular. It's a fresh and lively palate, with the sort of crisp elegance found in some European Pinots.","Red","Pinot Noir","Canada",5845
"99993","A vital, focused Cabernet, this shows the sheer classiness of Oakville in its concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit. It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second. It suggests it wants some time in the cellar, so drink now–2021.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99993
"25989","This Nero d'Avola opens with mature black-skinned berry, violet and leather aromas. The firm, juicy palate doles out ripe blackberry, dried cherry and mocha flavors while assertive tannins give it a firm, astringent finish. Drink 2018–2023.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",25989
"93682","There's a prickly, acidic bite to this dry Cab Franc that gives it a sour finish, despite some solid cherry and oak flavors. Drink up.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",93682
"49437","With superripe flavors of prunes and chocolate-covered raisins, this Cab Franc lacks the cherried gracefulness you want in the variety. It turns porty in the finish, with high alcohol and caramelized brown sugar.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",49437
"66000","Mellow, smooth and lightly spicy, this wine is well balanced and polished. It shows lots of berry flavors plus a bit of cedar and cinnamon while cleansing the palate with good fruit acidity and light tannins.","Red","Barbera","US",66000
"49793","Lots of ripe blackberry and cherry fruit in this Cabernet, accented with notes of licorice and oak. It's a good wine, full-bodied, tannic and dry. Very good now, especially after a brief decant, but too dependent on fruit for a higher score, and doesn't seem like an ager.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",49793
"3321","Sinewy texture and bright acidity meet a funk of blue cheese and forest in this interestingly complex and affordable wine. The earthiness continues in streaks of tart cranberry that ride along the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3321
"28686","A fifty-fifty blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this densely concentrated wine has aromas that suggest underbrush, wet leaves, black berries and prune. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry, raisin, black pepper, espresso, bitter dark chocolate and a sugary vanilla note alongside solid tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",28686
"84782","Sugary, with a chemical aroma and a sharp, volatile finish.","White","Viognier","US",84782
"42562","The first Feral made by new winemaker, Peter Devison, continues a tradition of excellence. Natural yeasts and fermentation in neutral oak, combined with a superb vintage and world class vineyard, equal a gorgeous bottle of wine. Creamy, leesy, textural and deeply imbued with mineral-soaked citrus fruit, flesh and rind, this ultrarefreshing wine is a joy. Notes of cucumber and melon contribute further complexity through the long finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",42562
"93050","A detailed wine, with notes of wet slate, apricot and pear alongside high toned spices. It drinks off dry, with ripe stone-fruit flavors balanced by crisp acidity, leading to a lingering finish.","White","Riesling","Canada",93050
"23205","A warm, generous wine, full of ripe fruits. There is weight, richness and generosity here, although not a great depth of flavor.","White","Chardonnay","France",23205
"56359","Leafy underbrush, sunbaked earth and a toasted note lead the way. The lean one-dimensional palate is a bit shy on freshness, offering dried sour cherry, raisin and a hint of dark spice alongside dusty, not very persistent tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",56359
"14604","Somewhat closed, the nose of this offering shows some red berry, currants and anise. An evenly textures palate, more of the fruits evidenced on the nose with slight pepperiness mark a classic Zinfandel profile. The finish is moderately tannic, and the wine has the potential to evolve for a year or two.","Red","Zinfandel","US",14604
"89130","Crunchy, tart but ripe apples abound on the nose and even more on the palate. This is reminiscent of a red-cheeked Cox's Orange Pippin apple and offers the same thrill and contrast between ripe fruit and crispness. This is dangerously animating and racy. It will make conversation sparkle. Finishes with a lasting apple tang.","White","Riesling","Austria",89130
"35491","An intriguing oak spiciness on both the nose and the palate makes this medium-bodied wine interesting without overpowering the focused and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors. The wine's texture is lean, braced by fine-grained tannins that give support and balance. Best after 2018.","Red","Red Blend","US",35491
"93542","A rich, 100% varietal in which warm sunshine coaxed out ripe  notes of figs and white peach, while the region's cool temperatures capture Sauvignon's minty, anise-infused side. The resulting wine is complex and dynamic. High acidity gives this very dry wine a nice bite of tartness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",93542
"29246","A great value wine, this fruity Syrah opens with bright blueberry, cherry and plum woven between subtle nuances of leather, spice and smoked bacon.","Red","Syrah","Italy",29246
"36596","Quite dry and reserved in flavor, this wine is intriguing: subtle rose petal and mineral notes, medium body and a bite of grapefruit zest on the finish that begs for another sip. One of the earliest producers of Gewürztraminer wines in Anderson Valley, it's still one of the best.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",36596
"12768","Creamy, rounded freshness with an immensely savory core of sage, arugula and white pepper make for an understated but seriously delicious white. There is weight and importance here, but it is lightly worn. The spicy, almost salty flavors keep you wanting more.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",12768
"69979","An elegantly crafted Chardonnay that marries vanillin oak with crisp, citrusy flavors. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy texture akin to lemon custard yet stays refreshing through the finish. Drink now through 2010.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",69979
"8835","A wonderful, rich wine, fermented in open stone lagars, giving a concentrated, beautifully soft wine. The texture is dense and velvety; ripe black fruits are given further complexity by wood aging. A superb wine, powerful and elegant.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",8835
"63955","This is tough in tannins and somewhat rustic now, in the way of young Monte Bellos. There's not much to recommend opening it anytime soon, especially if you're a fan of the modern style of accessible lusciousness. But it is rich and minerally, with a fine core of black fruit. Monte Bello Estate (not to be confused with Ridge's similarly-named Estate Monte Bello, which costs far less) is a wine that historically ages very well, and 2009 was a pretty good vintage, so you're safe cellaring it for at least 10 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63955
"65126","Dark and charred, with aromas of shoe polish, asphalt, coconut and blackberry. It's masculine in style, with firm tannins that bite down in support of concentrated black fruit, chocolate and spice flavors. Coffee, bitterness and heat work the finish on this tannic, full-bodied Cabernet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",65126
"7284","This is Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens own micro-project with husband Luc, and she doesn't miss the chance to craft a classic, gorgeous wine. Blending 85% Cabernet Sauvignon from Hendry Ranch and 15% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, this wine offers luxurious aromatics and a juicy core of blackberry, black cherry and soft, integrated tannin, a beautiful marriage of sites and vintner.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",7284
"73754","This textbook example of classic Rioja is light yet strong, with tobacco, earth and spice aromas accenting dry raspberry and plum scents. It feels juicy and agile, with popping acidity and crisp flavors of red plum and cherry. Like its gran reserva cousin from 2005, this finishes dry and can stand up to additional aging. Drink 2014–2025.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",73754
"76731","No two ways about it, this hot-vintage Gran Reserva is a plush wine. It starts with baked cooked stewed aromas that render the nose asleep. A soupy stewy palate tastes of baked berry fruits, prune and chocolate. Consistent with the rest of the wine, this finishes soft. Drink now.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",76731
"95591","Made from Cabernet Franc, this opens with scents of purple flowers, toasted oak, exotic spice and red currants. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberries, black cherries, ground black pepper, clove, vanilla and mocha alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",95591
"4957","Really nicely balanced, this is a big, sleek cruiser with lemon, earth and green-apple aromas and flavors. Full, yet trim and clean, it shows the tautness of youth but has fine essential fruit and a lengthy, crisp finish. Possesses excellent, if somewhat unopened elements, and may well rate higher if cellared for a few years","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",4957
"34826","An alluring nose of plum, leather and spice leads on this red, and on the palate, structured, big fruit flavors follow. It's jammy but has grip, and though slightly one dimensional, the wine has character. A good showing.","Red","Tempranillo","US",34826
"1571","There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.","White","Riesling","US",1571
"3820","This enticing and alluring wine opens with lovely crushed mint, new leather, iris and culinary spice aromas. The savory palate shows juicy Marasca cherry, ripe raspberry, cinnamon and pink peppercorn flavors while firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and structure. A licorice note accents the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",3820
"3349","With the majority of the fruit from the producer's Calistoga and Oakville estate vineyards, as well as its Healdsburg property, this is a dry, citrus-laden wine, zesty and refreshing in lime and grapefruit. The acidity is dialed high, yet remains balanced by the density of fruit and body, the overall effect just right in terms of ripeness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",3349
"1894","Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity. You'll get aromas of bright cherry and some spice but what makes the wine stand apart is the clarity and purity of its aromas.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",1894
"49660","This oak-heavy blend of Chardonnay and indigenous Sicilian grapes opens with luscious tones of toasted almond, apricot and candied lemon. There's a spicy vanilla note on the close, and the wine will appeal to those who appreciate an oaky Italian white.","White","White Blend","Italy",49660
"54978","The wine is a beauty. Dry, silky and pure in red cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, it was aged 16 months in 100% new French oak barrels, which give an appropriate measure of smoky caramel. With a sturdy acid-tannin structure, this supple Pinot classically exhibits the best of Anderson Valley terroir. Drink this in its flashy youth, over the next five years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54978
"63079","The wine is crisp, tangy and with plenty of grapefruit and lemon fruitiness. Its crispness and nervy texture are bright and refreshing. With fine acidity at the end, this is ready now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",63079
"66049","Fresh apple, pear and tangerine flavors revitalize the palate in this crisp, approachable Sauvignon Blanc. It's uncomplicated yet elegant, finishing on a penetrating streak of lemon-lime acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",66049
"63940","Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness. The palate is also sweet, but it has enough acidity and tannin to create a serious, almost scratchy mouthfeel. And if you hadn't had enough sweetness up to this point, the finish is loaded with brown sugar, cola and cough medicine.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",63940
"79801","Seemingly more candied and sweet than prior years, but still a reasonably good generic-style Cabernet if you don't mind a little sucking candy and gumball along the route. Flavors of strawberry and cassis are sticky but ripe, while the finish is chewy and sweet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",79801
"14188","This savory, easy-drinking red opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, forest floor, menthol, leather and raspberry. The medium-bodied palate doles out succulent wild cherry, baking spice and chopped mint framed in silky tannins and bright acidity. While it has structure, it's made for sheer drinking pleasure. Enjoy through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",14188
"73748","The Ogier firm, which controls this property, has made great strides recently. This is full bodied and silky in texture without being overly soft, and it boasts complex, well-integrated, interleaving notes of dark fruit, mocha, spice and earth. Drink 2015–2025.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",73748
"82392","It's all about sweet, delicious flavor in this 100% Cabernet. Dazzles the mouth with the essence of blackberries, cassis, cherry tart with the smoky crust, chocolate and exotic sandalwood, wrapped into the richest, finest tannins you can imagine. Compulsively drinkable, if a little too forward with its charms. Now–2013.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",82392
"58501","Another fine vintage for this value-priced, Bordeaux-style blend. It's loaded with raspberry and black cherry flavors, then brings in lighter notes of dried herb, ground coffee and dark chocolate. For its price, it delivers rather complex and well-integrated flavors.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",58501
"40850","This easy-to-drink, medium-bodied red blends 31% Merlot, 28% Shiraz, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc, then adds lashings of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. The result is a supple wine redolent of plums, vanilla and baking spices that finishes soft and creamy-smooth. Ready to drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",40850
"29514","An attractively crisp wine that is already well developed. There is lemon drop sweetness in the dosage and ripe grapefruit flavors. The wine is balanced and fruity.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",29514
"104254","Despite its age (the wine is from the 2005 vintage) this Barbera d'Alba is impressively vinous and fresh with bright berry notes backed by some prune and plum nuances. It's tart and chewy in the mouth.","Red","Barbera","Italy",104254
"62689","There's great minerality to this wine, as aromas of chalky soil mix with notes of brisk red apple skin, hard pear and a drizzle of honey. Fresh apple slices and orange citrus flavors liven up the mouth, ending with a lively and mouthwatering finish.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",62689
"32404","This is a good Syrah for drinking now, with rich berry, cherry, mocha, brown sugar and roasted meat flavors. The tannins are brisk, and there's a nice cut of acidity. This is far from the winery's best Darien Syrah, but it's delicious.","Red","Syrah","US",32404
"69413","Big in flavor and unabashedly tannic in texture, this dry and full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend has ripe flavors, dense concentration and firm, fine-grained tannins. Vanilla and milk chocolate aromas lead to red cherry and cranberry flavors on the palate.","Red","Red Blend","US",69413
"19928","Situated in the southern Médoc village of Macau, on the edge of the deep Margaux gravels, this estate has produced an impressive and structured wine. It is concentrated with its black currants and dark tannins. It is likely to develop slowly over several years. Drink from 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",19928
"61055","Smoke and tobacco aromas are immediately attractive, and with the delicious, but dry structure, here is a wine that shows both great potential and great elegance. There is power, as witnessed by the alcohol, but it is relatively muted, the berry fruits showing through the tannins, and then the acidity and velvet wood flavors finishing.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",61055
"13706","Adènzia is a Chardonnay-based wine with 13% Grillo grown in white, chalky Sicilian soils that offers a drying mineral note behind fresh aromas of spring flowers and exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and pristine but also has the natural heft to pair with delicious fish dishes.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",13706
"42503","Named after the lords of Hattstatt—a word that evolved to Hatschbourg—this wine comes from selected grapes. It's a medium sweet, rich wine with a smooth structure and opulent texture. Lychees and yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity to balance ripeness and freshness. It's a wine to age, drink from 2018.","White","Pinot Gris","France",42503
"28076","This is quite light, with a leafy character and barely ripe fruit flavors that hint at tomato paste. Some pineapple and vanilla flavors come in, making this a rather odd, though still interesting, budget bottle.","Red","Syrah","US",28076
"66273","This oak-aged Touriga Nacional is rich and opulent. It offers fine tannins, flavors of dark chocolate and spice as well as black plum and berry fruit. It's dark and firm at this stage with tannins and dense fruit. Drink from 2020.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",66273
"72017","Full in the mouth, this is a ripe, rich wine. With acidity, spice and warm yellow fruits, it is generous and has a spicy undertone. Acidity and peaches blend together well at the end.","White","Chardonnay","France",72017
"49121","There is something of the essential crispness and green fruit character of a Vinho Verde. But the wine also has some richness, weight, and a creamy texture. Very aromatic, this is a wine to drink and also age a few months.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",49121
"9799","Ripe and juicy, this wine has good acidity that accompanies the attractive, seemingly sweet tannins. Concentrated, it needs several years to broaden out.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",9799
"98890","This Priorat-like blend of 50% Grenache, 28% Syrah, and 22% Mourvèdre is pungent and spicy, with a bit of menthol in the nose. Supple and luxurious fruit, a mix of raspberry and black fruits, baking spices, sweet barrel flavors. Powerful and rich, this is a big wine with tobacco and clove highlights and a little heat in the finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",98890
"3794","In the past, Allegrini adopted a vocal stand against Ripasso (a middle ground wine between Amarone and Valpolicella) and for this reason Corte Giara Ripasso comes as a big surprise. Despite the controversy, this historic producer presents a very acceptable wine with pretty tones of sweet spice and bright berry.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",3794
"104834","This is a perfect example of why Moscato is so popular. What's not to like, with the crisp, clean mouthfeel and seemingly sweet flavors of honey, orange and vanilla? So zesty, it's impossible not to drink a few glasses, and the alcohol is refreshingly low.","White","Moscato","US",104834
"103614","Made from 96% Grenache Noir and 4% Syrah, this is a fresh, pretty and easy to like rosé, with attractive notes of peony, strawberry top, orange blossom and thyme. The mouthfeel is light, but flavorful, with a pleasant citrus-pith and watermelon-rind bitterness that lingers on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",103614
"61182","A Chardonnay at a decent price for what you get. It's sweet and creamy, with buttered toast, pineapple and peach fruit flavors that are accented with brisk acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",61182
"80327","A very nice approximation of Raymond's more expensive Napa Cabernets, this one shows blackberry and currant flavors, with a rich layer of smoky oak and a dry, smooth finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80327
"9654","This Cabernet gets the job done with its blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's nice and dry, and it will wash down a hamburger.","Red","Red Blend","US",9654
"60446","A pure expression of California, this Petite Sirah is soft as velvet, and explosively seductive in very ripe blackberry and cherry jam, violet, anise, cocoa and smoky vanilla flavors. It's a simple wine, but a very delicious one.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",60446
"46078","Herbal plum and berry aromas are gamy almost to an extreme. This multigrape blend has a lot of Syrah and Carmenère in it, and that shows. The palate is muscular in feel, and quite meaty and rustic in flavors, with tastes of olive and beef jerky. A blackened finish is more dark and oaky than fruity.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",46078
"10809","This is a woody blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan, which is not a common mixing in Chile. Oak, graphite, cocoa and berry aromas set up a narrow, astringent palate with citrusy acidity and sharp flavors of plum, raspberry and spice. Fresh acidity and herbal flavors dominate the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",10809
"66118","A complex and layered wine, this is always one of South Africa's top Chenin Blancs. The bouquet opens with notes of chalk, lanolin, toasted apple skin, blanched almond and clove-studded orange peel. The palate is toasty, but well integrated; the apple, apricot and melon fruit core marry harmoniously with the wood and sweet spice characteristics. Round and smooth in texture, but with ample acidity to keep the mouthfeel fresh and the finish bright. Drink now–2017.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",66118
"4208","This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4208
"100454","Deep and dense, this smells horsey and leathery, with aromas of earthy berries. The palate feels racy with acidity, and the flavors of berry, cassis, cola and vanilla lead to a sweet, jammy finish, with touches of vanilla and caramel.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",100454
"85364","This full-bodied wine is saturated with ripe and concentrated blackberry and black-grape flavors. A layered and nicely viscous texture clings to the sides of the mouth and holds all that gorgeous fruit through the finish. It's almost all fruit, dark chocolate and a touch of clove, with little obvious oak, for a pure and memorable character.","Red","Malbec","US",85364
"95252","The northern Rhône is inspiration for this Syrah. It's a dark, tannic wine, richly acidic, with complex, fascinating flavors of blackberries, smoked meat, cassis, cedar wood and black pepper. You get plenty of bang for your buck with this dry, elegant wine.","Red","Syrah","US",95252
"36624","This is a new wine from the Lurton brothers, and it's got good weight, color and integrity. It also shows a lot of hickory and pickle from the oak and some wayward vanilla on the juicy, jumpy palate. Not a refined wine but pretty good for size and zip.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",36624
"68587","Sweet berry and cherry aromas are fruity and a little heavy, while the palate is solid in feel and features flavors of sweet plum and berry fruit. Chewy on the finish, with good mouthfeel. Exactly what you'd want from a wine in this price range.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",68587
"66381","This firmly structured wine has a good, gripping texture and lots of black cherry and black-plum flavors. Backed by bracing acidity and a modest layer of tannin, it's a versatile wine for lunch or dinner.","Red","Merlot","US",66381
"40231","A good buy in a dry, full-bodied red wine. Clean and balanced, with jammy flavors of plums, earth and blackberry, it has well-etched and accessible tannins, a rich mouthfeel, and a spicy finish. Value.","Red","Merlot","US",40231
"5179","For the price, this blend of five varieties is a pretty good value. It's oaky and full-bodied in blackberries and cherries, although a streak of green unripeness runs right down the middle.","Red","Red Blend","US",5179
"47826","This ubiquitous brand does a fine job with Willamette Valley Pinot. This is a spicy, peppery wine that smoothes out into a broadly flavorful middle with streaks of light cherry and caramel apple.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47826
"13041","Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this salmon-colored sparkler opens with aromas of toasted nut, McIntosh apple and red berry. The creamy palate delivers ripe red cherry, raspberry, toasted hazelnut and a hint of cake spice alongside a soft mousse.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",13041
"100416","Aromas of jammy, candied berry fruits and wet dog fur amount to a murky whole. This is high in acidity, with a mishmash of berry and creamy, plastic-like flavors. A smear of oak dominates the finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",100416
"102130","Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust. Flavors of lemon and green apple are narrow, and the mouthfeel is limited and indicates that the lifespan of the wine may be short. Citric on the finish, and overall there's just not a lot going on here.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",102130
"32291","Ultrarich and spicy, with exotic flavors of bacon, cherry pie, cola and sandalwood. Notable for its structure, so dry and sturdy in tannins, yet so silky. A big, full-bodied wine, it should develop bottle complexity over the next four years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32291
"77023","A beautiful white blend, one of the best values on the market. Made from Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewurztraminer and Sémillon, it shows a near-perfect balance of crisp acidity, clean minerality, dryness and complex citrus fruit, peach, lychee, mineral and honeysuckle flavors. A compelling restaurant by-the-glass wine.","White","White Blend","US",77023
"105086","Very deeply flavored, with fine, ripe blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, anchored with an earthy minerality. The finish is thoroughly dry. Yet it's also a very tannic wine, with a bracing, but fierce, mouthfeel that suggests time in the cellar. Better after 2013.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",105086
"33305","This is a light, fruity wine with fresh red berry flavors and soft tannins. It has a cool feel from the nearby Atlantic Ocean, giving a bright, character and a wine that's ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",33305
"44081","The volatiles are quite amped while the cranberry flavors are backed by a firm grip tannins. There's good intensity and flavor but it doesn't all come together.","Red","Tannat","US",44081
"5939","Maculan is celebrated for its excellent expressions of international grapes grown in the Veneto. This easy blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers a cheerful bouquet of cherry fruit and mild exotic spice.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",5939
"83764","Aromas of gingerbread cookies with a black-cherry glaze meet black gravel and a touch of asphalt on the nose of this complex and flavorful bottling. The palate blends the brightness of red cherry and strawberry fruit with a rocky minerality, spiced up by black pepper and settling into a plum-skin groove toward the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",83764
"59900","Dark and smoky, earthy and compact, this textbook Cabernet Sauvignon shows muscle and steel at its core. Though tannic and still encased in a bit of a hard shell, it already displays beautifully defined varietal character, and it doesn't shy away from the herbal side of the grape.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",59900
"100709","Pine needle, orange peel and vanilla aromas are scattershot but pure. The palate is lean, tight and juicy due to pronounced citric acidity, while flavors of orange, tangerine and mango finish fresh but with a smear of resiny oak.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",100709
"66874","Ripe on the nose, with aromas of fruit cocktail and sweet tea, this is a straightforward Riesling bound to please most. The round and peach-driven palate is enlivened by a citrus backdrop, providing just enough lift to carry the short finish.","White","Riesling","US",66874
"92122","Gorgeously pure apple, both fresh and baked, immediately appears on the nose. Evolution is in progress here, slowly transforming fresh fruit notes into richer flavors. There is an edge of dried pear and dried lemon and orange zest. The body is slender and wonderfully dry and transparent. Savor this slowly.","White","Riesling","France",92122
"52350","Perfumed with violets and smoky wood, this rich wine moves away from structured Touriga Nacional to a more opulent interpretation. It is hugely rich, with a major spice and herbal character. Without apparent acidity, it is not for aging.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",52350
"77564","Simple and slightly sweet, this has flavors of raspberry, sour cherry candy and mint.","Red","Zinfandel","US",77564
"2223","Fresh and clean, with light, lemony aromas in addition to tropical fruit. The palate is textured and full, with fairly pure apple and pineapple flavors and some nuttiness. Everything works here, including the smooth, lengthy finish.  Best Buy.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",2223
"29090","Though not indicated as such on its label, this is a sweet wine. It has spiced, ripe fruit flavors, notably pear, which are deliciously laced with honey and cinnamon notes. There is also a fine streak of lively acidity that keeps this very fresh.","White","Pinot Gris","France",29090
"48057","A little sharp and ringing on the nose, with pine and citrus keeping it ultra fresh. The palate is mildly aggressive and zesty, with herbal raspberry and cherry flavors. With light oak and acidity kicking all the way to the end, this shows the crisp side of Pinot Noir.","Red","Pinot Noir","Argentina",48057
"39698","This simple Chardonnay is lush and ripe like a pineapple, mango and peach juice drink. Unabashedly fruity with sweetness on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",39698
"36193","Aromas of scorched earth, coffee, plum and clove lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The round, soft palate doles out blackberry, black raspberry, licorice and a bitter note of walnut skin alongside velvety tannins. Drink soon to capture the fruit richness.","Red","Barbera","Italy",36193
"83002","The main estate wine from Chocapalha, this is firm, with a beautiful balance between tannins and fruit. Blackberry and wood-derived spice notes are cut with acidity. It's elegant and ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",83002
"12426","This medium-weight selection offers concentrated aromas and flavors of black currant and blackberry laced with accents of pepper and earthy spice. There's a bit of bite to the moderate tannins, while hints of tobacco leaf and cocoa nib spice up the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Israel",12426
"19961","This wine is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Malbec. It shows the big, hard tannins of both varieties, as well as their dryness and intense blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. The 100% new French oak is in balance with the size of the underlying fruit. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015, and it should still be providing pleasure in 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",19961
"16203","Toasty wood and crisp lemon complement one another in this medium-bodied, richly layered and developed wine, complex in green apple and nutmeg. There's lovely structure behind this wine as well, making for a food-friendly pairing that should age well in bottle another couple of years.","White","Chardonnay","US",16203
"82745","This is a ripe wine that's also fresh and fruity. It has some structured tannins, along with a dense texture. At the same time, the red cherry and blueberry fruits have a crisp edge that finishes the wine with fine acidity. While the charity Hospices of Belleville owns land as part of its foundation, the wines are made by Beaune négociant Joseph Drouhin. Drink from 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",82745
"27153","Whiffs of dusty tobacco box and cedar accent roasted black-cherry and plum flavors in this light-bodied red blend. It's not a deeply concentrated wine but subtle earth and leaf complexities are elegant. The finish is marked by fine velvety tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",27153
"21203","This is a rich, smoky red-fruit-flavored wine. One of three wines produced by the estate that was created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy, it is made from biodynamically grown grapes. Wood aged, it shows spice as well as the cool fruitiness that gives the wine both its crispness and aging potential. Drink from 2018.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",21203
"4271","With its violet, berry, spice and leather sensations, this savory blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot displays the quintessential perfume of a youthful Chianti Classico. The juicy wild cherry and ripe raspberry flavors are accented by notes of cracked black pepper and hints of grilled herbs that add depth. Refined and delicious. Drink 2014–2018. Trilussa Wine, J.W. Sieg Wines.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",4271
"65366","For a pink sparkler, there's not a lot of fruit on the nose, which is carried by crisp yeastiness instead. There are lovely bubbles on the palate, full of crisp red apple and lemon citrus flavors that enliven all of the senses. This is a perfect apéritif wine.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",65366
"103675","Muted, with a strong suggestion of chocolate and mocha, this is thin, indistinguishable red.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103675
"53983","A spray of lemon-lime acidity casts a spotlight onto lush, easy peach and apricot flavors in this bright, juicy semidry Riesling. Delightfully quaffable, it's certainly a straightforward wine, yet subtle touches of blossom and bitter apple skin lead to an elevated finish.","White","Riesling","US",53983
"51282","Licorice and leather stand out in this softly layered wine that leans heavy on the palate. Made in a full-bodied, brawny style, it's single-minded more than complex, finishing in toasty oak and black pepper.","Red","Syrah","US",51282
"2632","This is an estate-grown blend of 61% Malbec, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Syrah. It sizzles in a mix of huckleberry and blueberry, full-bodied and dusty in tannin. Its juicy and lifted by moderate acidity, with oaky accents of vanilla, nutmeg and clove.","Red","Red Blend","US",2632
"41677","Very light on the nose, this wine from an extreme coastal site shows key limes, wet slate and pear flesh on the delicate, well-integrated nose. Ripe Pink Lady apples and lemonade show on the surprisingly juicy sip before settling into tighter lemon peel flavors and a chalky structure.","White","Chardonnay","US",41677
"35253","Full and rubbery on the nose, with berry, prune and foresty aromas. Quite tannic and biting on the palate, with espresso, stewed prune and bitterness to the flavor profile. Finishes hard and unyielding, with a lasting note of coffee-like bitterness.","Red","Syrah","Chile",35253
"43328","This complex, sophisticated and undeniably delicious wine blends strong flavor components into a harmonious whole. Aromas are lightly smoky and toasty, while flavors emphasize black tea, Bing cherry and sweet vermouth. The texture is firm and fine-grained giving a very smooth mouthfeel, and the finish lingers nicely.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",43328
"100367","This is a ripe, rounded and aromatic wine, with just the right stretch of minerality and juicy citrus flavor. Crisp, tangy and refreshing in its fruitiness, the wine is rich and full, finishing with a final burst acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",100367
"12813","Not all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",12813
"65450","This wine feels hard with bitter extraction that detracts from its fruitiness. There is a very dense texture that could soften over time, although bitterness could remain a problem.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",65450
"50778","This moderately pale wine doesn't show a lot of concentration or tannic structure, but it offers charming notes of cherry, clove and cinnamon. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",50778
"93919","This rich and forward sparkling wine is fit for everyday drinking, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry parfait accompanied by a nice doughiness. It's pretty scoury, though, which gives it an abrasive mouthfeel.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",93919
"94252","This wine is young, surprisingly fruity at this stage for this normally textured, structured Grand Cru. A pure line of sliced apple and green-plum flavors are shot through with tangy acidity. The fruitiness and intense acidity will pass soon and the wine will develop the proper steely, tight and mineral character. It will drink at its best from 2020.","White","Chardonnay","France",94252
"12068","Hot and leathery up front, with stewy notes and candied red fruit aromas. The palate features smacking tannic bite along with foxy-tasting red fruit. Turns medicinal on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Peru",12068
"86072","This Barolo shows its pedigree from Serralunga, home to the most powerful and age-worthy wines in the denomination. It opens with aromas of underbrush, tobacco, leather and cherries marinated in spirits. These carry over to the palate along with notes of sage and licorice. The assertive tannic spine needs time to soften and promises serious aging potential. Drink 2020–2040.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",86072
"52070","Herbal rubbery plum aromas are fully oaked, and thus there's a campfire/brush fire quality to the nose. There's energy on the palate, which holds steady and feels in tune. Spicy herbal red-berry flavors with a ton of secondary oak finish mild and dry.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",52070
"88847","Exotically floral and spicy, this delivers an intoxicating blend of exuberance and elegance. While delicately framed, the palate is rich, ripe and juicy, with sweet yellow-cherry and apricot flavors, and a slick of wax and honey. It's brisk and nervy, yet finishes remarkably long, with a swathe of green herbal tones.","White","Riesling","Germany",88847
"93827","Il Poggiale Riserva opens with bold tones of blackberry pie, plum, currant, leather, rum cake and dried rosemary. There's a ripe, almost jammy, quality to the fruit, and the palate feels dense and richly textured.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",93827
"86992","Time to rock with this new, lightly oaked cuvée from Esclans, a fresh, bright, full wine with forward fruit. Despite its alcohol, the wine has a light touch with a hint of pepper and rounded red fruits making it ideal for food. The wine will be best to drink from late 2016.","Rosé","Rosé","France",86992
"100099","The word massive barely begins to describe this Cabernet Sauvignon. It aims to compete with anything from Napa Valley, and does so largely successfully. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. What's harder to put into words is the elegance and balance. Despite its serious heft, the wine feels comfortable in the mouth. Indisputably an ager, it should begin to mellow after 2018, and continue to offer pleasure for many years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",100099
"47935","A lovely Sauvignon Blanc, tart and bone dry, with a bite of citrusy acidity that cleanses the palate. It carries pleasant flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, pink grapefruit and vanilla.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",47935
"15420","A very fun and pure-pleasure rendering of California sparkling wine. From some of the best grapes in Mendocino County, Pacific Echo has hit a home run. Delicious pear and apple fruit unfolds in sweet, nutty form. It’s creamy yet crisp in the mouth, and thirst-quenching—a nice bonus. Equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","US",15420
"12646","Made with 34% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Colorino, this has a restrained nose, eventually revealing aromas of black-skinned fruit and baking spice. The one-dimensional straightforward palate offers suggestions of plum, oak and a hint of coffee alongside fleeting tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",12646
"94335","From an estate-farmed property in the Russian River, this otherwise Carneros-based producer shows it can handle different conditions with aplomb, taking its foot off the pedal a touch in terms of power and concentration in this wine. Floral, soft and silky, it remains complex in red and black berry, with handfuls of truffled earth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94335
"66328","Mourvèdre may be the hardest variety to get right in California, but Villicana has succeeded admirably. What you need to know is that the wine is very dry and medium-bodied, and that highish alcohol gives it some heat. But not too much, and the wine really is marked by its complex cherry, red currant, licorice, tobacco and spice flavors.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",66328
"87352","Herbal and citrusy, this is a cleanly made Pinot Grigio that offers a modicum of complexity. Pear and citrus flavors mingle with notes of bitter herbs. Finishes with a hint of bitter grapefruit pith but also lingering apple notes.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",87352
"71911","Forward in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit, this Pinot's ripeness is balanced with crisp acidity. It's a flashy wine, quite typical of the vineyard, for drinking now and over the next six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71911
"31802","A gentle hint of soft and mellow vanilla frames the ripe, red-cherry fruit that appears readily on the nose. The palate discloses that same mix of fruit and oak influence, wrapping fresh cherry, both tart and ripe, in a rounded, smooth cloak of smoky vanilla. Tannins are fine and gentle. This wine is both fresh and fruity, with a bright, fresh finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",31802
"56874","Honey, toasted almonds and lemon slushie aromas are present on the nose of this Viognier from the El Pomar district. A very smoky element on the palate is a bit overbearing alongside the caramel, vanilla and other oak-driven flavors.","White","Viognier","US",56874
"100273","This wine has aromas of black plum, freshly baked pie crust, dried lavender and a touch of menthol in the nose and flavors of sweet cherry and red raspberry in the mouth.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Moldova",100273
"92420","Big, extracted and clumsy on first blush, with raisin and prune preceding chocolate on the nose. The palate is big and tannic, with chocolate and baked berry flavors. Finishes full, toasty and grabby, with mocha and vanilla. Drink now through 2012.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",92420
"69121","A soft texture and slight sweetness make this deep-pink-colored wine easy on the palate. It has lots of fresh melon and raspberry flavors.","Rosé","Rosé","US",69121
"16876","While this is largely neutral-smelling, it's flush in the mouth, with pithy citrus and green apple flavors. Lasting and steady on the finish, this blend of Chardonnay and Muscat is juicy and alert after initial dull aromas. Maritime Wine Trading Collective, Vintage Wines Inc.","White","White Blend","Spain",16876
"26991","This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power.","Red","Zinfandel","US",26991
"24241","Aged 12 months in French oak, this has creamy aromas of chocolate fudge and cinnamon. Made by Umbria's Maravalle family, this blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Merlot is easy going and crisp, with loads of fresh fruit flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",24241
"46884","This is an opulent, ripe wine that is full of black fruits and firm tannins. It is dense and concentrated with layers of juicy fruit piled over a drier core. It's a full-bodied wine that's still going to develop. Drink now or wait until 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",46884
"96867","This spent 16 months in neutral oak, and it shows some muted scents that may be attributed to those barrels. Earthy unripe fruit, tasting mainly of apple skins, also sends up light whiffs of fish oil. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96867
"45301","With its forward acidity, this shows its fresh side before revealing its ripe red-berry flavors. Tannins form a firm, solid base that dominates the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",45301
"101163","This wine from one of Anderson Valley's pioneers has a lighter-than-usual color and plenty of red cherry, raspberry and turned earth aromas. It offers low-level fruit flavors and good balance of acidity versus ripeness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101163
"89204","A blend that is dominated by Arinto, this is crisp and lemon flavored with hints of riper yellow fruits. It has a lively, bright aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",89204
"86833","Approachable now with an enticing mocha streak throughout that's lifted by the bright red cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Low tannins and medium acidity make this an easy-pleaser for fans of the grape.","Red","Pinot Noir","South Africa",86833
"86775","Concentrated and complex, this has structure and acidity, with a black cherry flavor. It's a ripe, powerful wine that could become more generous as it ages.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",86775
"4301","From a highly sought-after source of Cabernet, this is classically oaky and dusty, a sophisticated take on the grape, dense and soft in waves of black cherry. With medium weight that picks up steam on the milk-chocolate finish, it's an impressive sipper or worthy companion to steak and potatoes.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4301
"37559","A majority varietal, this wine also contains Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, combining for a taste of baked blackberry and licorice, the oak subtle in smoke. With a tannic bite on the midpalate, it resolves into smoother, velvety textures on the finish, inviting one in for another try.","Red","Syrah","US",37559
"24138","Horsey plum and pie cherry aromas include a whiff of latex gloves and Band-Aid. This feels rather raw and acidic, with bite. Salty sharp red-fruit flavors finish herbal, with tartaric shear.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",24138
"106424","From a fine site farmed by Steve Matthiasson, this crisp, delightfully compelling white is tart and tangy in orange and lime. Tight and youthful, it shows complexity and concentration while a steely elegance weighs in, ultimately allowing the wine to show an elegance of site and style.","White","Chardonnay","US",106424
"81108","This wine has dark tannins and considerable wood flavor at this stage. The structure and the weight are all there, allowing the fruit and rich texture to develop. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",81108
"56979","Shy scents of iron and wild berries barely reach the nose on this wine from San Benito County. The palate shows mostly dried violets and some tannic grip","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",56979
"78647","Baked, saucy aromas suggest the wine's overall character. It's ripe and stewy, with a grippy palate and a flavor profile full of tomato, herbs and red plum. Tastes herbal and roasted on the finish; aggressive, savory Rioja.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",78647
"106336","Beautifuly integrated oak spice and a deep well of fruit flavors combine in this richly complex and layered wine. It's medium to full in body, supple and mouthfilling in texture, and brings a great array of classic aromas to the table. Dark cherry, forest floor, cedar and a hint of wood smoke meld into a feast of flavor.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",106336
"56194","An elegant, restrained, yet lovely Pinot Noir from a much-maligned vintage. Soft, round cherry fruit is wrapped in sandalwood and mocha flavors. Fully ripe with fine tannins and lovely integration of the barrel notes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56194
"54817","The tannins are very hard on this bone-dry Cabernet Sauvignon, which was blended with 5% Cabernet Franc. It's tough to appreciate now, despite a wealthy core of blackberries, cherries and currants. Is it an ager? The best guess is no, it won't age, so drink now and over the next few years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",54817
"692","Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density.","Red","Syrah","US",692
"61845","Stony minerality surrounds sublime texture in this full-bodied, balanced expression of the appellation's Middle Reach neighborhood, an area known for producing wines of great beauty and subtle power. Apple, pear and richer characteristics of stone fruit are succulent on the palate, while a racy spiciness intrigues.","White","Chardonnay","US",61845
"19141","This is powerful and rich, allowing just a note of freshness to creep into the firm structure. Dark tannins, black fruits and smoky wood flavors combine harmoniously, lending a sense of great power and long-term aging potential. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",19141
"25279","Ruio Brut Prosecco is released a few years after the harvest to allow for evolved aromas of mature melon and apricot. Yet, the wine is streamlined and dry in the mouth with steely bubbles and a touch of almond skin as well.","White","Glera","Italy",25279
"76861","Damp earth, forest floor and huckleberry pie combine for a complex take on the variety, building texture and body on the palate as it goes. Relatively full bodied, it comes off as lighter and smoother than perhaps it is, revealing denser, more structured heft on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76861
"16509","Simple cherry aromas with notes of cinnamon and chlorinated pool open this light-colored but blocky Pinot Noir. It tastes salty and sweet, with generic plum and red-fruit flavors. Very little flavor stands out on a bland finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",16509
"80712","Stalky, burnt aromas are hardly the welcome mat one is looking for. In the mouth, this is sweet and soft, with a syrupy mouthfeel and candied flavors of berry fruits that come across fake in nature. This is 100% manipulated in style.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",80712
"10541","A leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luzón. Altos is the winery's high-expression baby, and if you like a bruiser with char, toast, coffee and other nocturnal characteristics, then look no further. Dynamite in terms of ripeness, with monster black-fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Not for the weak.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",10541
"13315","The deep color of this wine prefigures its dark aromas, which are redolent of black mission fig cake, chocolate and cigar box. The medium-full palate feels expansive, and it's structured with fine, mouth-coating tannins that carry onto the textured finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",13315
"67755","This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high. You can drink this instead of a red wine with lighter meats, such as lamb or pork.","Rosé","Rosé","US",67755
"106517","Exceptionally ripe, this has notes of tropical fruits, apricots and pears, with a glorious coating of sweet, smoky, buttered toast from the oak. It's pretty obvious in its appeal, and it will be enjoyed by many for its vast richness.","White","Chardonnay","US",106517
"18943","Coming from Monterey and Santa Cruz vineyards, this blend of 34% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre, 21% Carignane and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon features notes of plum jam, sagebrush and root beer. It jumps off the palate with bright acidity and grippy tannins, delivering ripe berry fruit and chili pepper spices, enlivening more senses than just tastebuds.","Red","Red Blend","US",18943
"41588","A pretty Syrah from Lazio, this fruit forward wine offers cherry, prune, spice and leather aromas. Dark plum flavors are pushed forward over the palate thanks to the wine's soft consistency.","Red","Syrah","Italy",41588
"74978","Bold blackberry and cola aromas work the nose on this bold, muscular Malbec-Syrah blend. But just when your expectations are at their highest, the palate doesn't quite meet expectations with its angular acidity and sharp-edged feel. The fruit is here, and with it the aromas and flavors. But moutfeel and balance are thin and piercing.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",74978
"94377","With a swirl, this wine's enticing new leather, eucalyptus, woodland berry and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The taut and savory palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and white pepper notes. Refined tannins and firm acidity provide balance while a hint of coffee signals the close. Drink 2020–2029.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",94377
"45893","Hints of earth and spice accent savory apple aromas on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Brisk lemon and lime acidity make it a refreshing, if straightforward, Riesling.","White","Riesling","US",45893
"74639","Rich and soft, this is a fine blended wine that shows layers of wood, ripe tannins, flavors of blackberry fruits and good balancing acidity. There is a delicious juiciness from the St Laurent, which is tightened by the other grapes in the blend.","Red","Red Blend","Austria",74639
"87757","Rich yet subdued on the bouquet, with elegant tobacco, lemon peel and earthy scents, this feels lush and full of heft, but it's not plodding or heavy. Flavors of spiced black fruit, molasses and tobacco are nice, and the finish features a long, dry, comfortable fade. Drink this winner now–2016.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",87757
"81880","This new vintage is as pleasing as those in the past, with spicy flavors touching on pink grapefruit, orange rind and flesh, and just a hint of sweetness rounding off the bright acids. It's well-balanced and in a prime drinking window.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",81880
"24486","This wine is concentrated, deep and tannic, yet nicely polished around the edges. It shows harmony between the vivid cranberry, black cherry, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors and the layered, fine tannins that give it a velvety texture. Drink now through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",24486
"866","This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.","Red","Syrah","US",866
"105911","For a mature, high-end taste of the Levante, this blend of 70% Cabernet with 15% each of Merlot and Syrah is at the top of the heap. It smells exotic and smooth, like sandalwood, baked berries and brandied plums. On the palate it feels firm and secure, with juicy, deep flavors of cassis and slow-cooked black cherry. This is a bullish red to drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",105911
"77228","From the far east of the Bordeaux vineyards, this is a soft wine that is already drinkable. It has red berry fruits, fresh acidity and a lightly tannic structure. Drink now and until 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",77228
"26742","Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",26742
"56409","This is a tangy fruity wine. It has crisp acidity along with spice as well as red-currant fruitiness. It is light and refreshing and ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",56409
"62506","Medium-bodied and soundly structured, this offers all of the flavor components that one would expect from 100% Cabernet: cassis, blackberry and plum skins. A solid finish with subtle tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Israel",62506
"90596","Spicy, tarry, gritty aromas of asphalt and olive drive the bouquet. This feels ripe and full bodied, with stewed plum, herb and cardamom flavors. Toast, dark-berry flavors and mint are the key notes to the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",90596
"32015","This brooding, brawny wine made from mountain fruit is all about mushroom and compost notes—a true expression of the vineyard's surroundings. Black cherry fruit and youthful tannins provide context, with a sizzling streak of acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32015
"69195","Veteran winemaker Lane Tanner teamed with Will Henry of the Henry Wine Group on this newer brand. This bottling shows scents of rose petals and earthy hibiscus as well as more brooding rooibos tea and plum aromas. The action-packed palate is subtly presented with flavors of iron, black plum, cranberry and clove.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69195
"11537","Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",11537
"38626","Aromas of leafy underbrush, tilled soil, blue flowers and dark berry lead the nose. The vibrant, straightforward palate offers crushed wild cherry, black raspberry, anise and white pepper. It's easy drinking and well balanced thanks to fresh acidity and sleek tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",38626
"72443","The 2006 Maté's Vineyard Chardonnay is the tightest and least evolved of KR's 2006s, showing slightly nutty, toasted-grain notes upfront, followed by crisp, taut flavors of pineapple and lime. Finishes long, with vibrant citrus flavors. Best from 2010-2015.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",72443
"64891","This wine is a blend of Malbec (69%) and Syrah. Aromas of plum and spice lead to a plump, flavorful palate full of fruit flavors.","Red","Red Blend","US",64891
"34568","Slightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",34568
"8179","Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 2017–2030.","White","Riesling","France",8179
"61331","Sweet oak aromas of vanilla extract, pencil shaving and cocoa butter flood the nose, overshadowing any pure fruit character. Soft and broad in texture, it has plum spice and sweet wood flavors that fade fast on the close.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","France",61331
"47157","This wine has dramatic, smoky aromas and ripe blueberry and toasted bread flavors. The texture is supple, making it hard to realize that this wine is as full bodied as it is.","Red","Zinfandel","US",47157
"7272","This is a cool-climate expression of Syrah from a biodynamically farmed vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The nose shows extreme tar, beef char, cracked black pepper and bay leaf, with gamy undertones. The tightly wound palate combines dusty elderberry with charcoal, more pepper and a lavender-rosemary flash on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",7272
"7546","From the Napa side of Carneros, this small-production Pinot is concentrated and oaky, layered throughout in spicy black cherry tart. The strong flavors lead to a strong, emphatic finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7546
"5689","Coffee, cigarbox and mocha aromas and flavors characterize this Rietvallei red. Complex and assertive, the wine unfolds with a chewy but poised intensity. The lingering finish has a tobacco-like touch. Pair with smoked meats, rich stews.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",5689
"102206","This has the capacity to rev-up any meat-based meal thanks to its aromatic intensity and overall spiciness. Sweet and savory at the same time, it delivers black cherry, clove, smoked bacon, leather, cola and dried fruit aromas.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",102206
"39242","Plum and berry aromas are infiltrated by touches of leafy green and leather on the nose of this texturally sound, herbal-tasting Malbec. Flavors of plum and spice are a touch weedy, while baking spice and clove notes take over on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",39242
"87913","A full, rich wine, showing red fruits at their best. It has structure and layers of bright acidity. It's not a wine for long aging, likely to be at its best in three years time.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",87913
"33374","A little too sweet for comfort, with jellied raspberry and cherry flavors edged with the vanilla and caramel tastes from toasted oak barrels. Grows more sugary as it sits in the glass.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",33374
"91491","From an up-and-coming estate in Umbria, this blended white (Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto) opens with generous aromas of ripe fruit, apricot, caramel and honey. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy.","White","White Blend","Italy",91491
"69285","Aromas like apple skin and peach skin lead to flavors with a little more heft and ripeness, like pears, lychees and apricots. It offers a lot of taste complexity and easily keeps the interest going with good acidity, medium body and an almost spicy finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",69285
"76412","A deep raspberry flavor is set in a vivid frame of spicy herb and toasty barrel accents. The finish is crisply defined, with slightly peppery tannins.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",76412
"105099","Here's a thick and opulent Brunello Riserva with a pleasurable and forward style that puts emphasis on intensity, quality of fruit and texture. The wine boasts a dark garnet color with aromas that span from exotic spice to pressed flowers. It needs at least five more years of cellar aging because the tannins are still a bit young.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",105099
"38386","Leafy herbal saucy aromas of plum and currant come with hints of tobacco and café mocha. This blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo has a Bordeaux-like flavor profile complete with leafy plum and herbal spice notes. On the finish, this holds onto its herbal character.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",38386
"99229","Maderized and brownish-gold in color, this is oxidized on the nose, palate and finish. Heavy, chunky and dull in feel, it has sherried flavors and a clumsy, weak finish.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",99229
"86954","Sweet graham cracker abounds, wrapped around a tart, lightly spicy note of apple. It's an interesting combination, a bit unusual, but it works.","White","Chardonnay","US",86954
"12477","Savory, rustic notes of dried mushroom and toasted nuts mingle with richly concentrated black-cherry and rose-petal flavors on this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Noir. Soft tannins and just a shade of toasted oak add richness and dimension to the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12477
"87705","Aged in 25% new French oak, the rest of it neutral, this age-worthy Chardonnay shows refreshing restraint, though it retains plenty of fruit. The aromas tend toward faint caramel and a complex web of acidity and brightness accompanies notes of apple and pear, a long finish capping things off.","White","Chardonnay","US",87705
"36852","Dark toast and char lend a spicy woodsiness to this bold, beefy Cabernet Franc. It's concentrated on the palate, with plush plum and blackberry flavors accented by savory tones of earth and animal. Finishes with a thick blanket of velvety tannins.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",36852
"82768","A bright and easy blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this would taste great with grilled sausage or barbecued chicken. A vein of fresh acidity is followed by notes of black cherry, dried raspberry and mild spice.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",82768
"93156","Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",93156
"40650","This tangy wine is crisp while also fruity. With its hints of herbal flavors along with green plum and apples, it is a juicy wine that is ready to drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",40650
"14911","Racy cherry and red berry aromas are salinic and light, while the palate is lean and revolves around tangy, citrusy red-fruit flavors. Fresh and a little rubbery on the finish, with a tight, singular personality.","Red","Pinot Noir","Argentina",14911
"20262","This is a hearty, tannic, big and burly wine made from a well-known vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Dense fruit flavors are framed by prominent notes of tar and leather, while a smoky char provides support and additional savory flavor.","Red","Zinfandel","US",20262
"62024","For a few dollars more than the regular CSM Cabernet, the Indian Wells delivers extra density and complexity. It holds firm, dark fruits and is slightly grainy, but well-ripened tannins carry the wine, and it's less dependent upon oak treatments and flavors of vanilla and cream. Persistent and substantial, it's offers good value, and often sells for less than the listed price.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62024
"99523","Unlike the heavily oaked Cuvée Crescendo produced from the same vineyard in 2005, this wine relies much more on ripe black fruits and open tannins. Certainly it has power, a broad and opulent character, the berry fruits jammy in their sweetness. Age 2–3 years.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",99523
"29561","Wild berry and vanilla rise to the fore on this rose-petal-piqued vineyard-designate, the site planted by this producer. There's some girth on the midpalate, and depth of flavor, along with a supportive structure of oak and tannin, the entirety teased in complexity. It finishes juicy and refreshing in pomegranate, wild mushroom and spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",29561
"82929","Cedar and spice are the lead aromas, and beyond that there's blackberry, pepper and floral notes that rain complexity down on the bouquet. The palate is superrich, a bit tannic and deep as night, with black fruit, espresso, syrup and spice flavors. Finishes brawny and long, with toasty richness. Drink now through 2013.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",82929
"82899","Earthy, oaky, leathery berry and spice aromas come around nicely with airing. This is a plump Rioja with modern leanings; it has good structure and pretty raspberry and cassis flavors. A round finish hints at raisiny maturity but doesn't overdo the ripeness. Drink through 2015.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",82899
"64227","Made in the modern style, this Cabernet is dark in color, soft in acids and tannins, and enormously fruity. The flavors of blackberries, blueberries, mocha and roasted nuts suggest sweetened granola candy. It's a flashy wine that impresses for its sheer power. Drink now-2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",64227
"5337","Aromas of game, cured meat, mature violet and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. It's extremely simple and diluted, with fleeting tannins and brisk acidity. Tried two bottles, same notes.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",5337
"22701","Romaneira's position on the north bank of the Douro above Pinhao always delivers rich, smooth and powerful wine. Its tannins, beautifully integrated into the ripe black fruits, are rounded, offering a dry core and a rich future. The wine, the top offering from this estate, is almost ready to drink. Just wait until at least 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",22701

"33914","Incredibly pure notes of freshly cut Cox's Orange Pippin assail the nose. The palate has the same purity and a linear, taut, rich but toned body that is yet to reveal all of its secrets. The purity and luminoisty of the fruit is astonishing. We have not seen the best of this yet. For now the purest apple fruit delights. This is deliciously concentrated and very youthful. Drink 2016–2030.","White","Riesling","France",33914
"4216","Named after the medieval rulers of the village, this cru wine is firm and structured in the solid style of the appellation. It has rich black cherry and black-plum fruits that come with juicy acidity. At the same time, the tannins and the dry core promise considerable aging. Drink from 2019.","Red","Gamay","France",4216
"83030","Good but common as Chilean Cabs go. It's a jumbled mass of bulky fruit, raw power, sweet oak and spice. The mouthfeel is tannic, grabby and big, while the flavors of black cherry and raspberry are nice but generic. Finishes with spice and a hint of hickory. 20,000 cases produced.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",83030
"16500","Cleanliness is a fleeting quality on this rosé, which smells compromised and artificial. A modest palate feel and dry, hollow, mostly fruitless flavors lead to a bland finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",16500
"72317","This young Cabernet feels thin and earthy, with little to offer in the way of fruit. Aged in American oak, roughly one third new, it is tart and unyielding.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72317
"22429","Perfumed in white flowers and apple blossom, this dark golden wine, aged in neutral oak, is soft and relatively light, a mix of ripe pear and vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",22429

"7627","Rich, ripe and oaky, this full-bodied wine has loads of sweet blackberry and black cherry flavors, with generous doses of oak spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, wood smoke and dark chocolate. It's bold but complex and will be a lot of fun to drink with red meat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",7627
"27360","Toast, lime and nut butter aromas lead to full-bodied but well-balanced kiwi and pineapple flavors that carry on the finish. The concentration wavers at times but there's plenty to hold interest.","White","Chardonnay","US",27360
"57024","Given sufficient time to open up, this cool-vintage wine brings notes of dried herbs, chocolate, anise, pencil lead and wood spice. The luscious chocolate and cherry flavors are soft, supple and concentrated, with enough tannins to benefit from additional time in the cellar. Drink after 2016 or give it a two-hour decant.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",57024
"4575","Big, spicy wine with its dark tannins and black fruit. Dark chocolate flavors go with the fruit, a rich and complex array of flavors that bring in herbs and spices as well as wood. Age for another 1–2 years.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",4575
"19583","Made from 70% Zinfandel, 17% Petite Sirah and 3% Alicante Bouschet, this is bocce-court wine, a nod to Sonoma County's vinous heritage that opens in forested notes and dried plum, blueberry and a hint of pine. Plush and full bodied, it holds on to its tannins without completely giving in to them.","Red","Red Blend","US",19583
"95493","A very juicy, fruity, light wine that shows spice and fresh black currant fruits. The acidity is a major element in this cool year wine.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",95493
"75102","Clovis Point's Black Label Chardonnay shares the ripe, voluminous feel of it's standard-label Chard, but offers a bit more freshness and structure. It's plump and full bodied, slick with honey and mango flavors, but cutting citrus acidity lends refreshment and balance. The moderately long finish is marked by lingering notes of nut, spice and toast.","White","Chardonnay","US",75102
"26802","Light and clear in color, this impish wine needs time to grow up in the bottle, its profile momentarily giving way almost entirely to savory Asian five-spice and a sharp acidity that should interweave together expertly over the years. Vibrant and complex, the fruit is sultry and dusted in earth. Set this one down through 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26802
"102431","The aromas of apricot, flowers and beeswax are like a welcome mat. The mouth is full and properly acidic; flavors of honey, ripe white fruits and some mustard seed make for a wine that's got a lot of power working for it. Best Buy.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",102431
"17703","Primary notes of green pear dominate the nose. The palate is tight with grapefruit zestiness, while some ripe yellow pear in the background provides measure and balance.","White","Riesling","Austria",17703
"73600","Crisp fruit unveils itself slowly in this classically refreshing wine, soft and medium in acidity and oak. It picks up additional ripeness on the finish, from mango to peach.","White","Chardonnay","US",73600
"59883","Fermented entirely in concrete egg, this is a light, clear red exuberant in earthy cherry and cassis. Ethereal, it offers spice and plenty of length around a shy body, a bite of fruit on the finish. Made in small quantities at a fair price, it's one to try for its sheer rarity alone, a good example of another light-bodied red that can do well in the appellation.","Red","Grenache","US",59883
"6795","This is a full, luscious and fruity wine, where the tannins linger behind the fruit profile. It has good weight, concentration, and delicate of wood aging. It should be aged longer before drinking, so wait until 2016.","Red","Red Blend","France",6795
"19504","This is a crisp and fruity wine that has fine acidity and a tangy orange-zest texture. The wine is full of green plums and with a salty, bright aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",19504
"67446","Lively, fresh notes of blackberry and red cherry are immediately apparent on the palate. Fruit takes center stage here, thus the wine should be drunk young while fresh and in its prime. It is honest and friendly, with a light body and spicy hints of white pepper in the background.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",67446
"63892","This extravagantly styled wine shows aromas like black pepper and grilled beef, then opulent deep black-cherry and dark-chocolate flavors come through. The spicy oak component is dominating and very tasty. Made from 61% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 14% Mourvèdre.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",63892
"92427","Minty at first, and herbal, the way a Cabernet can be, this Petit Verdot from Lodi is juicy and well made with licorice and spice and plenty of tannin structure. Its limp finish could signal the need for a bit more time in the cellar, perhaps 2–5 years.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",92427
"18162","This is a chunky, blocky, rather stolid take on what is usually a floral, perfumed grape. Here it is limited to thick fruit components —orange and guava—tart acids and some residual sweetness.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",18162
"76418","This is yeasty, bearing crisp flavors of pear and green apple, with a taut lemon-zest texture and a firm edge of minerality. It needs at least three years in bottle.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",76418
"35119","Smells citric and green, with carob notes that seem artificial and forced. Very simple, creamy and candied, with faux chocolate flavors and sweet fruit. Finishes like a strawberry dipped in cheap chocolate. Modest quality at best.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",35119
"12851","This succulent Amarone has a fragrance of cherry and raspberry with whiffs of baking spices. The palate delivers gorgeous black fruit layered with white pepper and nutmeg. It's shows an intriguing balance of power and finesse.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",12851
"105956","This wine is mostly Roussanne (58%) with the rest equal parts Marsanne and Grenache Blanc. The aromas of herb and peach are light and are followed by elegant lightly styled fruit flavors.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",105956
"60879","Strongly aromatic of black pepper, this blend of Syrah, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc is herbal like Cab and slightly sour-sweet on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",60879
"103726","The Algarve, in Portugal's south, is less known for its wines than as a holiday destination. This wine, with its blend of the familiar varieties (also found elsewhere in the country), is structured with red-berry flavors and tannins. The smooth texture and balanced acidity show it is ready to drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",103726
"99157","A fragrant blend of 80% Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina and Croatina, this stunning red offers enticing scents of dark-skinned berry, tilled soil, new leather, dark spice and a balsamic note. Elegant, structured and savory, it boasts juicy black-cherry, raspberry, white-pepper, cinnamon and tobacco flavors set against a backbone of firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2019–2030.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",99157
"58668","Deep in color, this rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon lacks zip and zest on a lazy nose. A chunky, grabby mouthfeel gives off the sensation of grape skins, while this tastes a bit foxy and herbal, with little to no fruit character.","Rosé","Rosé","Chile",58668
"27417","This Vignobles Dourthe wine is ripe and richly textured. Full and blackberry flavored, it is 84% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. An attractive interplay between the fruit and the tannins gives a balanced wine. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",27417
"61962","Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6–7 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",61962
"15363","Big, bulky, ripe aromas of cassis and blackberry come with a hint of cedar and spice. This Cab shows a clampy, tannic mouthfeel and loamy, ultraripe flavors of blackberry and cassis. Fudge, mocha and blackberry flavors drive the finish on this ripe wine from a hot vintage.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",15363
"17423","An intriguing waxy character shows strongly on the nose of this bottling, with ripe lime and green-apple aromas as well. The flavors are light and delicate, with a touch of pomelo that grows with patience into more tropical yet still restrained papaya and bubblegum elements.","White","Viognier","US",17423
"59925","Produced from four parcels of 100-year-old vines, this field blend wine is stylish and fruity while also being densely structured. It is complex with red fruits and dry wood flavors layered with perfumed tannins and richness that comes from fermentation in stone lagars. It really needs to age, wait to drink until 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",59925
"70495","A tart, astringent Pinot, it needs a bit more time in bottle to flesh out further. Tart red fruits are accented with muted herbal elements and just a light touch of barrel toast.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70495
"39941","This wine offers a wealth of big flavor and plush structure within a context of savory oak and firm tannin. Black olive and licorice highlight a nicely composed framework of plum and dark cherry, dotted with fresh tobacco.","Red","Merlot","US",39941
"106090","Green grass and a hint of baby powder are paired with notes of green gooseberry and lime on the nose, while riper but similarly tart flavors of white cranberry and citrus take hold of the mouthwatering palate. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",106090
"66596","Full of ripe, tropical fruit flavor, the wine is already generous. Apricot and mango come through the fresh acidity, giving both richness and a more textured edge. It is ready to drink, but by 2015 will be even better.","White","Chardonnay","France",66596
"106282","This fruity wine boasts flavors of mango, pineapple and apricot. It is full and ripe, with bright fruitiness and ample acidity. Some wood aging adds an attractive toasty accent to this warm wine.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",106282
"44250","Dusty, lightly woody aromas are smooth and easy to like. Peachy in feel, with moderate acidity, this tastes of peach and papaya in front of a melony, ripe finish that's a bit soft, so drink now.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",44250
"10071","An interesting wine, not without problems. Pours intensely dark, and opens with aromas ranging from blackberries to  earth and white pepper. In the mouth, straddles the ripeness line, with deliciously fruity flavors kept in check by an herbal edge. A blend of Paso Robles, Edna Valley and Santa Ynez Valley.","Red","Syrah","US",10071
"74069","Despite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now.","White","Verdejo","Spain",74069
"36249","A family-owned vineyard on this famous slope in Morgon supplies the grapes to Duboeuf for the wine. It is structured and dense, full of black plum and berry flavors. Acidity cuts through the tannins, resulting in a wine that will age well. Drink from 2019.","Red","Gamay","France",36249
"81275","Punchy up front, with aromas of wet dog, wild berry and raspberry, this blend of Carmenère, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon runs deep and ripe in the mouth, with loamy tannins and overall smoothness. Blueberry, blackberry and toasty flavors become more chocolaty on the finish. Overall this unfolds bit by bit to show complexity and intrinsic qualities. Drink through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",81275
"63050","Big, ripe and juicy, with some overripenes veering into raisins, but it gives a rich plummy edge to the wild berries, tobacco and spice. Drink this impressive Zinfandel with roasts and beef stews.","Red","Zinfandel","US",63050
"80612","Black-skinned fruit, charred earth and a whiff of leather lead the nose. Ripe and straightforward, the palate offers dried black cherry, tobacco and a whiff of licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",80612
"9170","Savory smoke and mineral tones persist throughout this light-bodied Pinot Blanc, lending a shadowy cast to its fresh lemon and lime flavors. It's refreshing, with a brisk, revitalizing finish.","White","Pinot Blanc","Germany",9170
"5372","Spry lemon and white grapefruit flavors are stark and steely in this dry-style Riesling. It's not deeply concentrated on the palate, but refreshingly quaffable.","White","Riesling","US",5372
"47601","Ripe, tropical-fruited wine, with apricot and peach and layers of toasty wood. The wine is fresh, finely balanced, finishing with a citrus hint.","White","Chardonnay","France",47601
"58304","Soft, opulent and plush, this Sangiovese-Merlot-Alicante from Trequanda is a well-executed wine with a thick layer of red fruit held in place by spice, caramel and chocolate fudge.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58304
"21921","Big black-fruit aromas of plum and wild berry get this young Tempranillo off to a good start. This feels juicy and as fresh as basic Spanish red wine gets; flavors of blackberry, dark plum and a hint of chocolate are rolled into one and finish clean.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",21921
"96787","Tastes like unsugared lemonade, with a splash of pineapple and cherry concentrate. Crisply acidic, it's bone dry. Clean and easy, a nice cocktail wine.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",96787
"28590","This lightweight Pinot Noir displays modest scents of cherries coupled with herbal elements, while in the mouth the cherries are tart, with a hint of green underripeness, and the wine lacks fleshiness. Pair with poultry or salmon.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",28590
"75086","This unfiltered, cloudy wine offers aromas of lime and yeast. A blend of Chardonnay (80%) and Viognier (20%), it's grown according to the principles of biodynamic viticulture. The juicy palate doles out white peach, vanilla and lemon, closing on a toasted hazelnut note.","White","White Blend","Italy",75086
"94358","Austere and elegant in its cool-climate, light-bodied way, this wine is dark and brooding nonetheless, offering a wild bramble of berry and rhubarb flavors. Firm in tannin and subtle in oak, it is dotted in black-tea and savory forest-floor edges.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94358
"75872","Needs time to soften up its somewhat aggressive tannins, but it has structure in spades. The aromas are pure varietal—violets and red fruits—and the fruit flavors are young and tart, suggesting watermelon, strawberry and wild raspberry. The tannins are ripe but still a bit sharp, and there is a classic finish of roasted coffee that seems more from the grape than the barrels. The purest possible expression of Cabernet Franc from an exceptional site.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",75872
"2798","Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out.","White","Verdejo","Spain",2798
"34373","Production has doubled and the price has risen in this latest vintage, but Portlandia has yet to land on a consistent identity for its Pinot Gris. This shows apple and pear fruit, showing more than a touch of skin contact flavors, with some bitterness drifting through the finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",34373
"77652","Soft and lightly fruity, this has an underlying chalkiness. That chalky sensation runs across the palate and seems to mute the other flavors, such as herb, which are on the light side.","Red","Merlot","US",77652
"2769","Electric lemon-lime acidity reverberates throughout this light-bodied Riesling. The palate is fruity, pulsing with sweet, fresh peach, apricot and tangerine flavors. The finish lingers on a delicately lacy sweetness.","White","Riesling","Germany",2769
"83849","This soft, spicy wine has red-cherry flavors and light tannins. It is smooth with black currants and acidity. The end brings in a more stalky character with hints of bell peppers.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",83849
"52004","Tart in acidity and pure in jammy raspberries and cherries, this is a Pinot to drink now. It shows the variety's lightly tannic, silky texture. Hints of unripeness develop in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",52004
"17975","Here's a most Burgundian, delicate Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at a price that can sometimes deliver clumsy, thin, and/or vegetal flavors. This has varietally-true detail, clean fruit and delightful nuances of citrus, dried herb and rose petals.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",17975
"97296","Blueberries and spice—think baking spices and cracked pepper—mingle easily in this medium-bodied, velvety-textured Syrah. Vanilla oak makes an appearance as well, but overall the wine is savory, with ample spice and structure. Drink now–2020.","Red","Syrah","New Zealand",97296

"86862","A deliciously ripe wine, all structure, intense black plum fruits, and sweet licorice and tar flavors. Bringing all these great flavors together are the fresh edge, the tannins and the dense fruits.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",86862
"98335","Sourced from 35-year-old vines, this offers both elegance and structure in a fairly light, nicely composed wine with interesting details. Its berry fruit has a vein of iron ore, and continues with some deft barrel flavors of nougat and toast.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98335
"79917","Aromas of underbrush, ripe dark-skinned berry, violet, leather and aromatic herb lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate doles out black cherry, cranberry, licorice, espresso and a sprinkling of mocha alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",79917
"57072","This blend of Aragonez and Touriga Nacional is particularly crisp and fruity. It has some richness, but it is the bright red berry and red currant fruit that makes it so refreshing. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",57072
"35715","Here's a structured red with lots of finesse. It opens with alluring aromas of fragrant blue flowers, red berries, baking spices and exotic herbs while the firm, vibrant palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, orange zest, licorice and a sprinkling of white pepper. It's still young but well balanced, with tightly woven but polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2017–2024.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",35715
"91284","Cheerful and youthful, this opens with a sweet bouquet of wild berry, red rose, freshly grated cinnamon and clove. It's hearty and dense, but it delivers flavors that are refreshingly clear.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",91284
"5263","Classic aromas of cassis and black cherries dominate this impressive effort from the south of France. Sinewy tannins and good concentration make for a fine balance in the mouth while notes of earth and mineral persist on the finish. Drink up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","France",5263
"66224","For a wine that can often be found for less than its $15 asking price, this is a very solid sipper. Ripe raspberry, red cherry and crushed slate show on the nose, while the light palate offers easy flavors of fruit punch and an herbal depth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66224
"62741","This is surprisingly tough and tannic for a 2007, but it does show the vintage's impressive fruit flavors. Notes of blackberry and cherry jam are complexed by touches of cassis liqueur and smoky cedar. The tannins will need to be tamed by rich, fatty fare, like grilled steak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62741
"42347","Fresh, fruity flavors of sun-ripened blackberries contrast with savory notes of smoked nut and granite in this elegant wine. Nervy acidity and a clean, mineral edge makes it refreshing and quaffable through the summer, but it's also substantial enough to enjoy with food well into autumn.","Red","Merlot","US",42347
"85374","This gentle, complex white offers lovingly crafted waves of tropical lychee and golden-apple minerality, with bites of wet stone, gravel and lemon. Balanced in acidity and a lightness of being, it's meant for the table or kitchen, to sip happily while making a meal.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",85374
"80839","Light in color, intriguing aromas of cedar, mushroom, orange peel, smoke and cigar box are followed by somewhat faint elegantly styled red-fruit and spice flavors. It falls a bit flat on the palate.","Red","Tempranillo","US",80839
"79341","Fermented in a Taransaud French oak open top tank, using Maresh Vineyard grapes exclusively, this delicious wine combines pretty cherry and pomegranate fruit with dusty spices, leading into a finish dappled with cinnamon toast and coconut. Lovely now, or give it a few more years in bottle.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",79341
"52592","This wine is velvety-smooth and full bodied in cedar, black licorice and blackberry jam, and is an approachable wine given its mountain beginnings. Compact and concentrated, it ends with length and plenty of toasted oak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52592

"50860","Made from Syrah that was grown on the steep, blackened slopes of Mt. Etna, this is round and plump, with aromas of blackberry and spice backed by black olive, bacon fat and crushed white pepper. It's silky, long and smooth.","Red","Syrah","Italy",50860
"98094","Formerly known as Cannubi Boschis, this impressive wine boasts alluring aromas of crushed raspberry, baking spice, chopped mint, violet and woodland berry. The savory elegant palate delivers succulent Marasca cherry, strawberry compote, cinnamon, licorice and a hint of coffee. Fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide polished support and great balance. Drink 2023–2038.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98094
"5155","Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful, as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage, and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash,  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5155
"43959","Continues Martin Ray's track record with this bottling, an elegant, likable Pinot Noir that appeals for its silky texture and forward fruit. Cherry, currant, toasty oak, vanilla and white chocolate flavors end with a spicy, clean finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",43959
"50635","On display here are bright aromas of red fruit and forest berry followed by deeper tones of dark chocolate and licorice. The wine is smooth and round with rich texture and well-proportioned sweetness on the close.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",50635
"25508","For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality. Although it's beautiful now, it should develop in the bottle for a decade.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25508
"55235","The top wine from La Rosa is produced out of selections from the vineyards and the cellar. Wood aged and with serious concentration, it is packed with dark fruits and dense tannins. They contrast with the generous texture and acidity. The wine should really age for several years. Drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",55235
"71003","Produced from 90% Merlot and 10% Malbec, this wine is made by two young brothers. It is ripe and structured, still young of course, but with delicious ripely fruity potential. Black-currant and berry flavors are lifted by acidity and held firmly by the structure. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",71003
"19119","Impressive, but too sweet for comfort, despite great streamlining acidity that keeps the finish clean. Tastes like sugared orange tea and pineapple jam, with the buttered toast and caramel of oak. Earns extra points for minerality and structure.","White","Chardonnay","US",19119
"50736","The aromas of fresh herbs, tobacco and barrel spice seem quite locked-up at present on this dark purple-colored wine. The full-bodied dark fruit flavors and lightly chewy tannins show a mix of grace and power.","Red","Malbec","US",50736
"16911","The three grapes (castas) are Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The blend makes a satisfyingly structured wine with some firm tannins as well as ripe fruitiness. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",16911
"23760","While the nose is restrained, the palate of this off-dry Riesling bursts with sweet, luscious pink grapefruit, guava and peach flavors. It's refreshingly crisp, yet deeply concentrated with a lingering, almost berried touch of sweetness on the finish. Drink now–2016.","White","Riesling","US",23760
"103825","This is full and fruity with great swathes of smoky tannins. Structured and concentrated, it promises a good future. Strawberry and red-plum flavors are there, along with the darker tannic element. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",103825

"4365","Innocent Bystander has been ahead of the Moscato curve, making this wine for a number of years, and it has always been among the best from Australia. The 2011 is perfumed and spicy, with ample strawberry and cherry fruit and a soft, frothy feel in the mouth. Drink it over the next six months or so.","White","Moscato","Australia",4365
"21402","The Elqui Valley is the new source for this Syrah, and we like its leathery, complex, smoky nose that foretells layered blackberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Fairly thick and modern, but balanced, with a long, lightly minty finish. Interesting and well seasoned with oak.","Red","Syrah","Chile",21402
"32859","A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot has produced this fruity, juicy while also structured wine. It has concentration with layers of wood aging to support and fill out the fruit. It is still developing— still a young wine. Give it until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",32859
"70102","This is a structured wine, firm with tannins and still showing some of the wood-aging. Red-berry fruits are cut with crisper blueberries and considerable acidity. This is going to be a firm wine that is lightened by the fruit, and a very good representative of the vintage. Drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",70102
"100536","This absurdly priced Carmenère is always one of Chile's best, and this vintage is just fine, with cherry, cassis, graphite, herb and eucalyptus-like green aromas. The palate is chunky and round in feel, with solid acidity and plump, herbal flavors of berry fruits, olive and spice. But what justifies a $235 price tag? You can be the judge.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",100536
"84930","Full body, a broad texture and very ripe flavors give both heft and softness to this cedar- and brown-sugar-scented wine. The ample fruit flavors taste mature and fully ripe, like dried plums.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84930

"53110","This boasts tiny portions of Teroldego, Merlot and Croatina that give the wine a soft, lush disposition. Some 42 months of oak aging also add to the palate's overall silkiness. Flavors of chocolate, cherry, plum, tar, resin and licorice are all recognizable.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",53110
"62136","Forward and fruity, this is a solid, drink any time Chardonnay. It's built in a blocky chunky mode, but some sleek lime flavors put a polished edge on the underlying acids.","White","Chardonnay","US",62136

"31736","The wine is 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It was largely fermented and aged in stainless steel, but there is some minor French oak influence,  bringing a subtle soft smokiness. The fruit itself is exotic  and complex, ranging from Meyer lemons, limes and green apple to guava and pear. Dry and acidic, it's a gorgeous wine to drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",31736
"61824","Here's a rosé from last season that's still bright and lively. Aromas of raspberry and watermelon are fresh and inviting, while the palate is medium in intensity, with red licorice and strawberry flavors. Drink now and this wine should still be crisp and refreshing.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",61824
"4708","Ripe blueberries, toasted oak, caramel, brown coffee, black pepper and crushed grape seeds combine for a pleasant smoke and fruit combo on the nose of this bottling. There is a nice chalky texture on the energetic palate, where dense elderberry and blackberry notes meet with tobacco ash flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4708
"30236","Whiffs of sage and brush lend an herbaceous quality to this vivacious wine. Apple cider and honey tones are bright and sweet, accentuated by puckery lemon-lime acidity.","White","Riesling","Germany",30236
"22695","Organically grown grapes go into this very fine wine. Its structure and balance confirm that it's still young, bursting with juicy ripe berry fruit and with firm background tannins. Its great fruitiness is contrasted with the strength of those tannins and with its concentration. Drink from 2020.","Red","Malbec","France",22695
"6155","Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",6155
"12251","This is a beautifully structured ripe wine that is full of dense red fruits and tightly wrought acidity. Crisply textured raspberry flavors dominate. This is a rich wine that can be kept for a few months. Drink at the end of 2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",12251
"95417","Stalky aromas of leathery berry fruits suggest animal and earth. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate, with saucy berry flavors that fall off towards stalky and stewy. A dense tannic finish is structured but tastes herbal and stalky.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",95417
"1608","There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",1608
"11794","A full nose of flowers and citrus is followed by quiet flavors of lemon and spice in this friendly Chardonnay from Keuka Spring. Subtle and easy, the wine will pair well with grilled fish or chicken salad.","White","Chardonnay","US",11794
"103275","Full on the nose, with heavy black plum and tea aromas that fall off towards herbal. The palate is big, clampy and tannic, with herbal berry and black plum flavors along with a hint of grass. Finishes with size and power. Made with certified organic grapes.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",103275
"24232","Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torrontés, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",24232
"56575","On the western side of the Lisboa region, this vineyard occupies a beautiful protected valley. The wine is made in an immediately accessible style with bright red fruits and light tannins. It is fruity, ready to drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",56575
"6382","This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured.","Red","Red Blend","US",6382
"64147","Here is an utterly irresistible wine—spicy, sensuous and layered with beautifully ripened citrus, tree and tropical fruits. A whiff of pine needle continues as a flavor thread, along with vanilla, buttered nuts, lemongrass and macaroon. This wine just keeps on going.","White","Chardonnay","US",64147
"72686","From an estate vineyard high atop the appellation and blended with 9% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, this is a bold, balanced wine made by Julien Fayard. Juicy blackberry and blueberry layer along soft, fine-grain tannins, making an impression on the palate. A creamy richness lingers on the finish, accented by black licorice. Cellar through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72686
"83879","Aromas of huckleberry, herbs and spice are fresh and focused. The fruit flavors are concentrated, with a supple feel and soft tannins. It displays a good sense of balance.","Red","Merlot","US",83879
"97179","If you aren't familiar with Ripasso (a hybrid wine that borrows elements from austere Amarone and informal Valpolicella), this selection from Bolla is an excellent introductory wine. It opens with a deep-ruby color and bright aromas of red cherry, cola, spice and leather. It ends with both sweet and spicy nuances.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",97179
"31601","Warmly sensuous in the mouth, this gentle and attractive Pinot Noir offers soft fruit, a mix of berries and plums, that slides gracefully across the palate. It's dappled with light hints of cracker and chocolate, and the balance is maintained until the very end, where there is a finishing heat spike from the 14.5% alcohol.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31601
"41345","Herbal jalapeño aromas invite one in initially, before the wine takes on a bright, lively acidity and components of dried fruit and nuts. Creamy on the palate while still maintaining that acid, it offers a lingering sense of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",41345
"17270","So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",17270
"35320","A richly layered white, this wine opens in butterscotch and mango, making no bones about its ripeness and voluptuous nature. Acidity saves the day and keeps the proceedings from getting out of hand, allowing the finish to find balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",35320
"16429","Dense and rich on the palate, this shows the concentration achieved in this coastal location. Snap pea, pineapple and nectarine elements combine for a harmonious whole that lingers on the finish, picking up more austere hints of wet stone. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",16429
"58068","The finest Walter Clore since the 2001, this Bordeaux-style blend shows considerable muscle and depth. Built upon firm, cherry-berry fruit, it adds nuances of baking spice, pepper, vanilla wafer and a pleasing earthiness to the tannins. It represents the ultimate expression of Columbia Crest, and the 2005 marks a welcome return to excellence.","Red","Red Blend","US",58068
"3060","Fragrant and floral, this blend of 55% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Nero and 15% Pinot Bianco offers aromas of lemon blossom, white flowers and toasted almond. The palate shows an impressive depth of flavors, including yellow apple, lemon cream pie and peach alongside an elegant mousse. The creamy flavors are brightened by lively acidity.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",3060
"106189","Attractive aromas of cigar box, forest floor, plum and berry get this Tempranillo off to a good start. It feels crisp and juicy, with proper acidity cutting into flavors of buttery oak, raspberry and plum. On the finish it remains buttery tasting and turns grabby but also tangy.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",106189
"3052","A bit broad on the palate, this wine offers ample melon and fig flavors but lacks that vibrant zesty character that so often sets Marlborough Sauvignon apart from the pack. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",3052
"78828","Lively cherry and berry aromas come with a touch of prickle and snap. The palate has a wiry, energetic feel, and the flavors of berry and cherry satisfy and come with aftertastes of molasses and baked sweetness.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",78828
"25119","Light, bright and fruity, this has soft tannins, plenty of red fruits and balancing acidity. Just dry to finish, it is ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",25119
"76034","Sagebrush and forest floor are met by strong flavors of cola and cardamom in this somewhat flat, forcefully ripe and full-bodied wine. Asian spice continues to ride a layer of black cherry and berry through the moderate finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76034
"55173","This is a smooth, wood-aged wine. Ripe black fruits are soft, with a contrast of toast and spice. It's juicy, with just the right amount of tannin. Although it's almost ready to drink, the wine will also age because of its structure. Drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",55173
"52429","This is a second wine from Palmaz. It's a big Cabernet, dry and full-bodied, with extravagant cassis, cherry and oak flavors that contain riper notes of red currants and licorice. Gets better as it sits in the glass and breathes, and could benefit from up to five years in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52429
"106387","Fresh apple notes on the nose of this off-dry sparkling are pretty, but hindered by whiffs of dust and green stems. Softly pétillant with a creamy, mouth-filling froth, it finishes with a pleasantly sweet note. An unusual blend of Pinot Franc, Chardonnay, Aligote and Riesling.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Ukraine",106387
"61228","A sound, everyday wine with some special qualities. It's dryish and super-fruity in cherries and raspberries, and even has some salty, smoky notes of bacon. The alcohol is refreshingly low.","Red","Merlot","US",61228
"101223","Very juicy, easy blueberry-fruited, light Zweigelt made for fun, easy drinking. Unpretentious and honest, this could also be chilled in summer. Wonderful for picnics and other occasions where a joyful but uncomplicated red is needed.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",101223
"54969","There is a great link here between the tannins, delicious red berry fruits and blackcurrants and the almost architectural structure. The wine certainly has fine fruit, a great balance, very complete, finishing gently, ripe and soft.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",54969
"22814","Nicely layered, this offers an intensity of black plum and chocolate around a soft core of approachable, rounded tannins. Medium bodied, it has a mix of elegance and decadence that makes it drinkable now and impressive from start to finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22814
"59254","This hugely dense and tannic wine wraps its full-bodied legs around a core of dried, somewhat diluted fruit. It's on the savory scale of the spectrum, more clove, dried herb and black tea than anything else.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",59254
"11274","The deep color matches the bold grapy flavors. With a touch of sweetness, soft texture and syrupy balance, this will chase down a spicy burrito or kung pao chicken.","Red","Red Blend","US",11274
"97403","Complexing notes of botrytis are interspersed with an unusual pine aroma. The palate is bit simple but gives way to a very long finish with focused flavors of petrol and lemon.","White","Riesling","France",97403
"85265","A full bouquet includes aromas of licorice, tire rubber, dried cheese and ripe plum and berry fruits. Flush, pulpy and fruity in the mouth, this Cab Franc shows bold boysenberry, currant, plum, spice and tea flavors. On the finish, this is smooth, with good flow and moderate tannins. Drink through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Argentina",85265
"25376","A whiff of evergreen lends a cool, alpine touch to white grapefruit and lemon notes on this refreshing, delectably fruity Riesling. The palate is just off dry, bursting with ripe white peach and tangerine flavors. It's satisfyingly quaffable, yet finishes elegantly with a fringe of lime-zest tannins.","White","Riesling","Germany",25376
"60411","Very light in the glass, this wine shows cola, dried strawberries, dried rose petals, sagebrush and a rustic leather element on the nose. The palate offers lots of dried herbs, from oregano to sage to marjoram, as well as Earl Grey tea, all against a light raspberry-cranberry juice frame.","Red","Grenache","US",60411
"15505","Tight and tannic, this opens with aromas of Amaretto, ripe berry, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers black cherry, licorice, white pepper and cherries marinated in spirits. Firm but refined tannins provide structure.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",15505
"73975","Earthy, mulchy berry aromas lack freshness and clarity. This is a dense, meaty, thick Malbec with stewed black-plum and woodspice flavors. Used tea bag and baked berry flavors show on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",73975
"102988","Hints of woodruff, green pear and grapefruit zest frame the ripe yet firm palate. A pleasant phenolic edge adds even more structure, while the finish is bracingly clean. A tight and concentrated wine which will last and develop.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",102988
"92942","Not much going on in this dry, acidic Pinot Noir. The cherry fruit is thin, allowing the alcohol to show through.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92942
"71971","A good followup to the 2008. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in similarly dry citrus, lemongrass, gooseberry and mineral flavors. Lacks a bit of ripeness, which pushes it into green territory, with resulting acidity, but a pretty, clean sipper.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",71971
"51191","Mike Dobrovic, winemaker at Mulderbosch, coaxes a blend of open rich fruit with a spine of steel from his fruit. The wine is definitely New World in style with its creamy wood flavors, yet it also has the ability to age, which is more Burgundian in character.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",51191
"82823","This wine may surprise you with its rich round full-bodied fruit. It's not the racy, high-acid style you might expect from a BC winery–rather it pumps up the flavors with pear, peach and papaya front and center, clean and fresh. Fermentation took place in a mix of oak, concrete egg and steel.","White","Pinot Gris","Canada",82823
"97429","There almost is the slightest touch of lovely Poire William spirit on the nose. This is a lovely pear-scented, dry wine of immense fruitfulness. A homely earthiness counteracts this and makes for a concentrated, medium-dry but mellow palate. The finish is off dry, lasting and mouthfilling. There is something immensely satisfying about this.","White","Pinot Gris","France",97429
"10728","There's a touch of heat to the nose of this Shiraz that slightly overwhelms the black plum and berry aromas. In the mouth, initial licorice and mulled boysenberry flavors transition nicely into the short but peppery close.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",10728
"53704","The soapy, flowery nose is not uncommon for this variety. The palate, meanwhile, is pointed and direct, with extracted citrus and white-grape flavors. Similar citric sharpness carries onto the finish.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",53704
"69729","Clean, mellow and inviting, this bears rich flavors of raspberries and cherries, brightened by crisp acidity. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69729
"83694","Off dry, crisp, and with a strong citrus element that gives a lemon-candy character to the wine. It's a light, bright wine that's great for drinking this summer. Screwcap.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",83694
"60811","Here's a dry, elegant Grenache for drinking now. It has a silky texture, with slightly rough tannins and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mocha, pepper and herbs.","Red","Grenache","US",60811
"37378","Dense young tannins and 18 months in oak dominate the wine, promising a rich future. The fruit weight is all there, ripe blackberry flavors that will come through over the next months. Marie-Dominique and Jean Watrin have been the owners since 1994. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",37378
"33816","Here's an informal, easygoing white that offers sensations of banana, peach and pear. It's simple and refreshing, with brisk acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",33816
"100641","New producer Hannah Nicole has done a nice job, working in a light style, sourcing from Grenache Noir grapes and fermenting in 100% stainless steel. Totally dry, the wine is all strawberry and watermelon, with a tiny note of wax like the kind found around Bonbel cheese.","Rosé","Rosé","US",100641
"72860","Spicy and jumpy smelling, with red fruit aromas. The palate is alert, upright and tangy, with both citrus and red raspberry flavors. Reasonably good in terms of mouthfeel, with a light, herbal finish. A bit lean but exceedingly fresh.","Red","Merlot","Chile",72860
"70178","Yeasty in baked bread aromas with an integrated framework of soft tannin and oak, this clone designate offers bright acidity amidst a ripeness of red currant and plum. Coffee flavor and tobacco give it an additional complexity of savory tension.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",70178
"4929","With 62 acres of vines, this estate, which was created by the monks of Cluny, is one of the largest in the Mâcon region. This soft and fruity wine is immediately attractive. Apricot fruits are freshened by green plum and lemon. It is light and ready to drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",4929
"69417","Dark berry and cassis aromas precede a focused chewy palate. Blackberry, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors come together well, while a chunky full finish is ripe and satisfying.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",69417
"27801","Accurate varietal character abounds in this value red. There’s dark berry and a slight herbaceousness, but not in an off-putting way. Light in style but it possesses nice mouthfeel with smooth cassis fruit and a decent finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","France",27801
"40722","Aromas suggest tilled soil, mature blackberry, leather, game and allspice. The lively palate offers prune, cherries marinated in spirits, ground black pepper and licorice alongside a firmly tannic backbone and brisk acidity. Drink 2016–2012.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",40722
"53907","Ripe blackberry, black cherry, red currant, clove, tobacco, licorice and cedar all unfold in this sleek, polished blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Silky tannins provide the elegant framework, while a mineral note closes the finish. Drink through 2021.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",53907
"91092","Rosso Carillon is aged one year in oak to produce smoky notes of toasted almond and exotic spice. The bright, compact mouthfeel offers cola, sour cherry and wild blueberry endnotes.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",91092
"64481","This bottling is the work of Jaffurs general manager David Yates, and the 2014 shines as a great example of blending wines of varying degrees of ripeness. The nose shows thyme, olive, cranberry and fennel, with a warmer hint of vanilla. The palate offers intriguing mulberry and red plum fruit, with exotic notes ranging from sichuan peppercorn to preserved lemon to kalamata olive.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64481
"91814","Woody berry aromas are solid but standard. This blend of Marselán, Tannat and Merlot is hard as nails, with rubbery tannins. Saucy plum flavors are green and spicy, while this shows abrasive residual tannins on a firm but limited finish.","Red","Red Blend","Uruguay",91814
"104124","The lovel floral aromas are a pure expression of the grape's unique spice and rose petal characteristics. It's deeply flavorful, soft, elegant and lingering, with a lychee flavor.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",104124
"61998","Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",61998
"36389","This blend of Chardonnay (44%), Viognier (39%) and Roussanne (17%) has surprisingly light aromas of melon, peach and straw leading to full-feeling, tingly stone-fruit flavors. It wants more aromatically but the palate delivers the enjoyment.","White","White Blend","US",36389
"28786","Enticing plum and baked-strawberry aromas invite the nose on this bottling, as do sandalwood, cola and nutmeg notes. The palate begins with soft cranberry and then dives into oregano and thyme before moving into more restrained gravel flavors, finishing with juniper and pine needles. This wine's wound-up structure will unfurl nicely with time.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28786
"43866","Thick and concentrated in black and red fruit, this is a spicy, robust and oaky wine that shows the power of the vintage and site.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",43866
"44182","Ripe yet understated notes of white current, golden fig, apricot and graham cracker prove this Chardonnay's discernable depth. Medium to full bodied, this wine feels luscious, and its toasty flavor and energetic acidity will match grilled arctic char.","White","Chardonnay","US",44182
"25649","A beautiful wine that has plenty of weight and also a firm structure of minerality to go with the yellow fruits that are now evolving into more mature flavors. It is by no means at its peak yet. Give it 2–3 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",25649
"47309","For a wine that's been made with a soft touch but still has some weight and finesse, this is a great value. It opens with aromas of ripe peach fuzz and crisp apple, a nice intermingling of flavors. Lemon and grapefruit rind flavors shine on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",47309
"70840","Aromas of sandalwood, curry, cumin and toast rise up from the glass, while the cranberry/black cherry fruit leaves an impression of rock at its core. Immaculate and very young, this suggests a wine whose complexity is still sheathed in the primary, fruit-driven flavors of the vintage. Drink 2017–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70840
"94829","With a color somewhere between salmon and mauve, this offers a boozy bubblegum nose, reminiscent of fermenting strawberries. The flavors are also driven by strawberry, but with lemon rind bitterness and minerality present as well.","Rosé","Rosé","US",94829
"88759","Full-bodied and refined, this offers aromas of mature plum, vanilla, exotic spice and French oak. The firm palate delivers dried cherry, black raspberry, chopped herb, licorice, ground pepper and mineral alongside tightly knit, fine-grained tannins. It's an impressive effort for this scorching vintage. Let the tannins unwind for another few years then enjoy sooner rather than later.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",88759
"82242","There's a touch of honeyed sweetness to this Pinot Grigio, but it finishes dry and clean with acidity. The Meyer lemon, honeydew, peach and green apple flavors are sunny and rip. It's a nice wine to drink with southeast Asian and fusion fare.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",82242
"79354","Lemony and toasty, this approachable wine is rich and balanced, its texture soft and the flavors long-lasting, highlighted by a taste of lemon meringue.","White","Chardonnay","US",79354
"104453","This is actually a 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon from the producer's estate, and a selection of the winemaker's three favorite barrels of the vintage that fit best together. It is also the first release of the wine, made to honor the winery's 10th anniversary. Savory and high-toned in acidity, it masters a tartness of currant, cranberry and clove while integrating a soft, lean lushness of black cherry, the whole succulent and complex.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",104453
"4233","A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",4233
"103893","While ethereal in structure, there's a seductively penetrating appeal to this light-footed Pinot Noir. Initially pronounced notes of smoke, dried herb and cedar fade into a dusty rose and cherry perfume. Blossom and sage aromas extend into the palate, lending a sultry flair to brisk Maraschino cherry and raspberry flavors. The finish extends on a pleasant bite of bitter almond.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103893
"66008","This wine is somewhat shy in aroma, with rust, light raspberry, cherry, gravel, dust and a slight cola element arising with patience. Bright red-cherry fruit and hibiscus shows on the sip, yet it's a tad dried out. Slate and riverstone touches add minerality, and the structure is defined by a rocky grip.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66008
"96039","Containing all red Bordeaux varieties except Malbec, this wine has a sweet vanilla-caramel character that devolves into baked prunes.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",96039
"15507","Aromas of ripe red berry, fragrant blue flower, cake spice, menthol and an earthy hint of truffle emerge in the glass. The juicy palate offers fleshy cherry, raspberry, licorice and chopped mint alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink through 2022.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",15507
"90131","A consistent wine, year in and year out, MandraRossa's fresh Nero d'Avola would pair perfectly with pizza or simple spaghetti and tomato sauce. It shows loads of cola, licorice, dark fruit and bright acidity on the close.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",90131
"47483","Rounded and approachable, this estate-driven wine is 100% varietal and dusty on the palate in tight-grained oak and tannin. The flavors are richly rewarding, etched in chocolate-covered raspberry, clove and an herbal undercurrent that's hard to pin down.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47483
"35882","This is a soft and rounded wine. Just off dry, it has apple and pear fruits with balancing acidity. Everything is in moderation, giving a wine that is drinkable now with a bright aftertaste.","White","Riesling","France",35882
"66966","Aromas of smoke, vanilla, pencil box and green herb are followed by red fruit and medicinal flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66966
"74264","Green bell pepper and cedar aromas lead the nose of this easy-drinking blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas carry over to the fresh palate, along with black currants and black cherries. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",74264
"97040","Rooty aromas of licorice blend with earth, leather and cheese scents. It feels thick and chewy, with condensed flavors of grilled meat, berry, chocolate and herb. It's big and creamy on the finish, but it shows no evolution or improvement from the palate.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",97040
"30449","Pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot show brightly on the nose and palate. Simultaneously refreshing and sophisticated on the palate, this wine has a crisp, lingering finish laced with flavors of almond blossom.","White","Chenin Blanc","India",30449
"39630","A fifty-fifty blend of native grapes Cesanese di Affile and Cesanese Comune, this savory, medium-bodied charmer offers juicy black currant, blackberry, white pepper and intriguing charred notes. It's well balanced with fresh acidty and lithe tannis that offer easy-drinking pleasure.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",39630
"94501","Intriguing aromas of earth, roasted almonds, beeswax and ghee prove almost mead-like on the nose of this twist-top single-vineyard bottling by Larry Schaffer. The tightly wound palate is more restrained and familiar for the variety, offering honeyed pear and citrus peel flavors.","White","Viognier","US",94501
"15132","This is an impressive Touriga Nacional from its home region. Aged for 12 months in wood, it has mint and eucalyptus flavors to add to the dark tannic fruit. Blackberries and juicy acidity are combined with the core of tannins to deliver a powerful statement that needs some more time to mature. Drink from 2019.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",15132
"90306","Sticky-resin aromas are derived directly from the barrel. This is cloying in feel, with heavy oak flavors and oily tropical-fruit notes.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",90306
"79190","A slightly herbal edge and floral notes mingle with the dark berry and cherry aromas. Hints of tobacco and soft sweet spice add depth to the mouth, which is otherwise bright and vibrant but also straightforward. Drink now.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",79190
"8113","Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine. The fruit does have an herbal edge but it is lingering, complex and interesting. Think of it as the vinous equivalent of a cello-viola sonata—dark and mysteriously intertwined.","Red","Red Blend","US",8113
"40633","Barrel fermentation, with the full malolactic treatment, yields a ripe, buttery wine that sets up rich and plush on the palate. Despite the fat, buttery style it isn't overblown or flabby, and lingers through a clean, polished finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",40633
"102730","This wine is 70% Syrah and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, with fruit coming from Yellow Jacket, Stoney Vine and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Aromas of herb, ember, black cherry, earth, smoked meat and plum are followed by palate-coating, rich fruit and savory flavors, with enough tannic structure to benefit from some time in the cellar.","Red","Red Blend","US",102730
"93039","With small amounts of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this likable, broadly appealing wine is well made, generously rich and softly layered in blue fruit, chocolate and integrated American oak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93039
"101790","Whispers of fresh green herbs and lavender lend elegance and refreshment to intensely ripe yet pristine black cherry and plum flavors. The palate is succulent and juicy, marked by crisp, cutting acidity. Fine, velvety tannins cushion a long finish. Drinks well now but should hold beautifully till at least 2024.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",101790
"85862","A mix of peach and lychee aromas give an exotic edge. Full in body and fleshy, this is endowed with concentrated flavors and tense acids.","White","Chardonnay","US",85862
"6180","This young wine is fruity and fresh, perfumed with spice and lemon blossom. The tight texture will soften as the wine ages to bring out the warmth and richness of the vintage. Keep this long-term wine and drink from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",6180
"58476","This hits the jackpot. You taste it and are struck by its incredible richness, but then the balance kicks in, making it all the more impressive. It shows intense mountain flavors of blackberry, currant and dark chocolate, which are set into firm tannins. New oak brings delicious layers of vanilla and buttered toast. So good now, you can hardly keep your hands off the cork, but it should develop for many years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58476
"73285","Strawberry fruit runs into light, candy cherry, carrying just a slight hint of milk chocolate. It's a pleasant wine with modest concentration.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73285
"51669","Lean and firm, the wine has a dry, tannic layer that is emphasized by a burnt, smoky character. The fruit needs time and is likely to be austere.","Red","Gamay","France",51669
"46358","Aromas of ground pepper, clove, mature plum, black currant and charred earth emerge on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend, with a whiff of game. The palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, licorice and grilled herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A tobacco note marks the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",46358
"47302","This wine's dark root beer and cola notes surround a core of plummy fruit. There's ample body and richness, supported by soft tannins and crisp acids, but the overall sense is one of immediate approachability.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",47302
"56620","Grapes from the vines around the 13th-century castle of La Bastide are sent to the Marmandais co-op for a separate bottling. This smooth and ripe wine shows plenty of rich mango and apricot flavors cut by lime acidity that gives a lift of freshness. Drink now, although the wine will age until 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",56620
"80495","Delicious flavors like those of a pear tart and a soft, expansive mousse make this wine easy to love. It combines richness and a luxurious texture with light flavors of butter, vanilla, pear and nutmeg.","White","Chardonnay","US",80495
"43554","A fifty-fifty blend of Aglianico and Piedirosso, this monolithic wine is dominated by sweet oak, coffee and espresso sensations along with undertones of black fruit. Additional fruity richness would better support the overwhelming oak and astringent wood tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",43554
"72974","Grapefruit peel and tart lemon combine for a memorably savory beginning to this crisp wine. This one integrates its acidity with a medium weight into a clean, dry and lengthy package of flavor and bite.","Rosé","Rosé","US",72974
"23223","Too soft by far, with sugary sweet, medicinal cherry-berry flavors and a sharp cut of acidity. Tastes like an inexpensive Port.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",23223
"71000","Although this youthful wine has obviously been in plenty of wood, it has the weight to reveal a promising future. So while the spice and toastiness are present now, they will soon integrate with the fine tannins and blackberry fruits. Drink this from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",71000
"104973","Crushed earth notes juxtapose ripe lime, tangerine and melon in this refreshing easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc. Medium bodied with a crisp tonic mouthfeel and brisk acidity, it's an appealing apéritif and summer quaffer.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",104973
"25558","Very gentle, perfumed honeysuckle notes are distinct and enticing on the nose. The palate follows this with a perfumed, opulent medium-sweetness that is reminiscent of sugar-plums and candied fruit pastilles: there are peach and plum and unbridled richness with a slight phenolic grip.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",25558
"43642","Simple, sweet and oaky, this Chard has ripe flavors of tropical fruits, pears, lemon tarts and vanilla. It's fine for big parties where Chard is in demand.","White","Chardonnay","US",43642
"1550","A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1550
"68759","Comes down on the hard, rough side of the Petite Sirah spectrum, with jagged tannins and dry flavors of cola, green mint, blackberries, bacon and black pepper that turn bitter toward the finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",68759
"80296","Subtle and crisp in minerality, this Pinot Blanc has a rich texture and a taste of apple and pear with a savory, herbal element throughout. It would serve nicely as an alternative to Chardonnay, especially on the dinner table.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",80296
"88216","This is a seductive wine, concentrated and full bodied and entirely big. Black cherry, chocolate and blackberry jam ride the palate with authority, as soft tannins wrap around the bold flavor.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88216
"85387","Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive, but hey, that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate, this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice, tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu. Drink through 2025.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",85387
"2262","This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",2262
"51178","An unusual blend of Zinfandel and Merlot, this is a softly fruity wine of great charm and appeal. There's lots of upfront spicy fruit, framed in melted tannins, and it's sprightly and refreshing on the palate. It's easy to like and immediately drinkable, yet possesses enough richness and complexity for the best tables.","Red","Red Blend","US",51178
"20372","This single clone estate-grown wine was vinified 50-50 in stainless and mainly neutral oak. It's classic, classy and clean, with well-delineated components. Green melon, apple and citrus, along with ample acid and some phenolic bite are in harmonious balance. Another year or two in the bottle could improve it still further.","White","Chardonnay","US",20372
"23165","Drier and more streamlined than many Viogniers out there, with a crisp spine of minerals that undergirds the variety's traditional exotic flavors. Beneath the chalk you'll find savory tastes of apricot jam, blood oranges, mint and vanilla.","White","Viognier","US",23165
"30790","Winemaker Jacques Grange produces relatively small quantities of this blend of 70% Grenache and 10% each of Bourboulenc, Clairette and Viognier. It's moderately weighty, but also refreshing, with bright notes of pineapple, star anise and balsam fir. Drink it over the next six months.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",30790
"14132","Medium weight, round and tangy, this shows a core of cranberry/cherry fruit, a whiff of cola and a suggestion of the tack room. It's a detailed and somewhat earthy Pinot Noir. From the estate vineyard, it's what you hope to find in Oregon— Pinot that is artisanal, a little quirky, distinctive and above all, enjoyable. Fades just a bit too quickly.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14132
"83254","This wine really benefits from the delicious ripe fruit of the vintage. So broad, rich red-berry flavors give the wine a generous character with just the right amount of the balanced acidity. The wine is full, fruity and ready to drink.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",83254
"14995","The picturesque hilltop hamlet of Capalbio in southern Tuscany is the site of some exciting new wines. Tenuta Monteti is a leader in the area and this extracted blend shows tones of espresso, dark fruit, tobacco and spice. Drink in two or three years.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",14995
"31566","Soft, sweet and chocolaty, with gooey raspberry, cherry and currant flavors. Decadently good in its own way, but kind of candy simple in its appeal. Ready now.","Red","Syrah","US",31566
"12756","A rather delicate Viognier, still lightly yeasty and very fresh. There is an underlying minerality that suggests water over river rock, and nicely cut and defined yellow fruits. A lovely bottle to pair with a wide range of mild cheeses, or simple fish such as fresh trout.","White","Viognier","US",12756
"37909","This richly structured wine exudes the ripeness of the vintage. It has full tannins, dense black currant and berry flavors and a refreshing line of acidity. The tannins are still firm, needing some time to unwind. Drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",37909
"66960","Grilled mushroom and a gamy note define this wine, from the highest point of the winery's estate. It's velvety thick, smoky, concentrated and forested in flavor, with strong accents of dried herb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66960
"61542","Aromas of red berry and balsamic herbs provide the focus of this vibrant and easy-going wine made entirely with Sangiovese. The lush palate offers black cherry and a hint of licorice alongside firm but ripe tannins. There's no complexity, but this enjoyable red is perfect to pair with everyday fare. Drink now. Wine4All, Specialty Wine.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",61542
"4682","Coming from the same stable as Léoville las Cases in Saint-Julien, the wine is finely structured with firm tannins and dark fruit. Rich plum flavors are counterbalanced by solid tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",4682
"40734","Aromas of mature black fruit, leather, vanilla and a whiff of incense take shape in the glass. The palate offers dried cherry, licorice and espresso alongside hearty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",40734
"88066","This is a solid, jammy red that offers forward notes of black plum, cherry and berry. The medium-weight mouthfeel is direct and attractive, as the juicy black-fruit flavors are complemented by moderate tannins and balanced alcohol. A well-done and immediately accessible selection to enjoy now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",88066
"89280","Purple as they come, with extracted aromas of boysenberry, blackberry, maple and bacon. It's a wide, flush wine with bulk, 14.5% alcohol and savage flavors of blackberry and smoky BBQ. Definitely for fans of big, modern Spanish wines; Old World enthusiasts will probably call it “too modern” and overdone.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",89280
"51080","This is tart—like a squeeze of lime was added to the wine. The acids brighten the raspberry and persimmon flavors to give this Pinot Noir a mouth-watering quality. The acidity is characteristic of the cool vintage and the vineyard's location, which is in the cool southwestern part of the valley. Drink now–2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51080
"19160","Celebrating 500 years as grape growers, the Mellot family offers this top Sancerre. It is rounded and spicy with a touch of wood to add to its rich character. Apricots and pineapple are a delicious addition to the citrus acidity that cuts right through the wine. Age for 3–4 years.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",19160
"74233","This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",74233
"27999","Structured, smoky and full of black cherry fruits, this is a wine whose appellation of Villages brings out just that extra bit of weight and richness. It's still fruity, ready to drink and fresh on the finish.","Red","Gamay","France",27999
"33568","The layer of tannins verges on too much. It is saved by ripe fruit that cuts through to give a warm, red currant and berry freshness. Acidity is well in balance in this wine that needs a few months to age. Drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",33568
"25360","Aromas suggest leafy underbrush, woodland berry and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The lean palate offers raw red cherry and the barest hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",25360
"102092","Lush, rich, beguiling now. Tastes fat and unctuous, like a Pomerol despite being made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a creamy wealth of cherries, currants, chocolate, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak. For all the flamboyance, it's bone dry, with classically solid Napa tannins, courtesy of fruit from Oakville and Howell Mountain. Should develop in the bottle through 2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",102092
"100329","Ripe and fruity, this has sweet black-currant and plum fruits, a layer of rounded tannins and a juicy, full-in-the-mouth character. It will be ready to drink in a year.","Red","Merlot","France",100329
"79908","Muted aromatically, the wine is still generous in bright red fruit flavors, mostly strawberry-rhubarb and savory pomegranate, with accompanying layers of allspice. On the midpalate is the suggestion of vanilla before the finish delves into herbal, slightly sour territory.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",79908
"17753","This blend of Groppello, Marzemino, Sangiovese and Barbera from Italy's Lake Garda displays a fresh note of cherry marmalade upfront. There's a rustic but genuine feel to the wine (in a screwcap bottle) that would help it match hamburger or barbecued meats. The mouthfeel is lean, crisp and thin.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",17753
"20886","This soft wine offers ripe yellow fruits and a gentle texture. Bright with acidity, it also has peach and melon roundness. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",20886
"33094","Balifico stands apart thanks to its dark, rich appearance and generous aromas. The blend is Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, and together these grapes offer notes of cherry and cassis, plus touches of dried rosemary and toasted spice. In contrast to the boldness of the bouquet, the palate is fine, polished and long-lasting.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",33094
"83890","Boisterous fruit shows on the nose of this wine from the heart of the newish appellation, presented in a specially made Ballard Canyon bottle. Olallieberry jam gains nuance from pulverized purple flowers. The palate begins with straightforward purple fruits then evolves into potpourri, incense and dried berries.","Red","Syrah","US",83890
"77304","Short on aromatics, with only a whiff of pear and corn. The palate is soft and fleshy, with dry, limited papaya and melony flavors. Lettuce and other green notes carry the finish, which is bland and dilute. Will have a very short lifespan.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",77304
"25379","Intoxicating in vanilla and peach, the aromas telegraphing honeysuckle and anise, this balanced, dry vintage Brut from 100% Chardonnay grapes is soft, food-friendly and easy to drink.","White","Chardonnay","US",25379
"85762","Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with aromas of tilled earth, leather, truffle and mature berry. The chewy palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, licorice, clove and aromatic herb framed in velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",85762
"94790","There's an almost green tint to this wine and the nose shows honeyed peach, Key-lime pie, kiwi fruit and a touch of white pepper. The palate is tightly focused yet brings ample structure, with lime rinds, green-apple skin and red-apple flesh combining for a strongly complex sipper.","White","Albariño","US",94790
"90065","This Chardonnay-based Satèn sparkling wine opens with creamy aromas of vanilla, lemon custard, apricot and dried sage. The wine has a smooth, rich and persistent character thanks to the delicate quality of its perlage.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",90065
"79974","Shows the Morgan signature of full-bodied weight, concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit, brisk acidity, notable tannins and dryness that make their Pinots Noirs so enjoyable. Very nice to drink now and over the next 3–4 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",79974
"100542","One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this 100% Cabernet, which hails from the winery's Stags Leap District vineyards. It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined. If you can keep your hands off it, this is a wine to cellar for many years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",100542
"34694","A smooth, wood-matured wine, this shows all of the richness of Braucol and Duras. Named “the spirit,” it is a true evocation of the rugged nature of Gaillac, with a mineral streak and a big black-fruit flavor. Age for 4–5 years.","Red","Red Blend","France",34694
"62877","Aromas of lanolin, wet wool and squash indicate that this wine has lost much of its fruit. That's confirmed on the palate, which feels tired and thin, with fading stone-fruit flavors. The wine is nearing the end of its drinking enjoyment.","White","Albariño","Spain",62877
"20440","Highlighted in cherry-vanilla and toasty oak, this wine is structured and brimming in juicy red fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",20440
"44826","Doesn't say so on the label, but this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, from the Atlas Peak area. Very dry and tannic, with an astringent lockdown, it's functionally undrinkable now, but it does show the intensity of this mountainous region for Cabernet, with explosive blackberry, blueberry and black currant flavors. All indications are that it's an ager. Hold until 2015, at the very least.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44826
"106126","Pretty aromas suggest violet, sandalwood, incense, plum and chocolate. The ripe palate offers crushed black cherry, mocha, espresso and vanilla alongside firm tannins. A licorice note signals the close.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",106126
"74592","Sassicaia has been showing amazing results in recent years, and the 2009 vintage opens with all the intensity and beauty you should expect of Italy's flagship super Tuscan. Notes of blackberry, soft spice, chocolate, espresso and a touch of rosemary oil make for a beautiful bouquet. The mouthfeel is long, supple and rich. Drink after 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",74592
"96498","Whiffs of juicy melon and yellow peach brighten darker notes of potpourri and aged honey on this very pleasant late-harvest Riesling. Quite hefty on the palate with hints of dusty minerals and a sharp, clean acidity.","White","Riesling","US",96498
"14154","This pure Syrah—the first reserve Syrah from Gorman—pulls out all the stops. It's a tannic, bold, earthy and powerful wine that's loaded with black fruits. Aged for 20 months in 100% new French oak, it takes the wood in stride, adding Red Mountain minerality to the mix.","Red","Syrah","US",14154
"13778","There isn't much in the way of attractive fruit on the musky, sweaty nose. Lemony, spicy flavors are also broken up by the unwelcome taste of chicken soup. As a whole it's fairly dull and chunky, and not very evolved or fancy.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Italy",13778
"64231","An unfinished masterpiece, still dominated by youthful yeasty flavors, ripe with white peaches, pears and a crisp pink grapefruit element. The wine has minerality, but the juiciness is still to happen. Three to 4 years at least.","White","Riesling","Austria",64231
"64558","From a vineyard located at 1,700 feet with a western exposure, this single-vineyard expression offers candied red plum, clove, lilac, wet slate and dust on the nose. The palate is very tart, with cranberry and raspberry fruit lifted by fennel spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64558
"42926","Already a full five-years-old, this cool vintage wine brings aromas of freshly brewed coffee, baking spice, vanilla, green herb and tobacco. The flavors are light and elegant, showing a pretty styling but the concentration doesn't always seem fully there.","Red","Malbec","US",42926
"40369","The grapes obviously were well grown, as this wine shows a particular intensity of red cherry fruit, as well as minerality. The acidity is just about perfect, the tannins brisk and fine. Yet it's too young to offer full enjoyment. Cellar this polished Pinot Noir for 4–6 years to let it change in interesting ways.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40369
"29065","Aromas of green wood, vanilla and cola are followed by plump fruit flavors. The palate brings appeal but the aromas don't seem to match up.","Red","Merlot","US",29065
"58104","Evergreen and herb notes accompany fresh apple and lemon flavors in this dry, medium-bodied wine. The palate is brisk with focused acidity and an invigorating lime-zest astringency on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",58104
"39288","This is a straightforward, clean, fruity wine, with a green apple flavor.","White","Pinot Gris","US",39288
"29696","Young, bright raspberry fruit brings fresh, forward flavors front and center. There's a touch of cherry Popsicle also. It's an undeniably pretty wine, ready to drink, though don't look for much in the way of either depth or concentration.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",29696
"26574","Under the watchful eye of consultant Eric Delacroix, the Bazin twins (Thierry and Odile) created a wine that is dark and dense. This is a young wine with good potential. Its black fruits and solid tannins are rich and structured. Acidity and ripeness go together and will let the wine develop well. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26574
"34277","The pungent aromas of grass, waxy lemon and canned corn on the nose are followed by more citrus and overripe melon on a palate. This is zippy and clean but finishes slightly bitter.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",34277
"48102","A rich, full-bodied, yet also elegant wine that is ripe and mature. A selection of the best lots, it has spice, rich red plum and generous texture. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",48102
"30716","Produced from vines grown on the plateau above the Loire east of the town of Saumur, this wine is beautifully ripe and honeyed while still dry. Acidity cuts through the fruitiness and creamy texture to give a crisp aftertaste. This wine is young and drinkable, although it will be so much better from 2018.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",30716
"88659","Fresh berry and cherry aromas come with a pinch of lemon and also a rose note. It has a tangy, fresh feel and snappy, semitart flavors of red plum and raspberry. Limited and short on the finish, but zesty all the way through.","Red","Mencía","Spain",88659
"103442","Luscious, almost heaving with ripeness and alcoholic warmth, this dry-style kabinett is no shrinking violet. Its rich peach and melon flavors and bold, unabashed style are seductive though. Dense and mouthfilling, it will drink well through 2020.","White","Riesling","Germany",103442
"91505","This estate, managed for the owner by Producteurs Plaimont, surrounds a perfectly preserved medieval castle. The wine is firm with tense tannins and intense juicy acidity. It has a structured character full of blackberry fruit and with a dry core. It hints at being mature already although it will be much better to drink from 2018.","Red","Red Blend","France",91505
"65402","Although this wine is labeled as medium sweet, it has a distinct dry element from the spice. It's rich, full of lychee and mango fruits that have retained some freshness. Floral and ripe, it will be ready to drink from 2016.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",65402
"67230","This blend of 70% Sangiovese with Canaiolo, Colorino, Ciliegiolo and Malvasia shows fruity berry and violet aromas. On the palate, juicy black plum fruit is laced with baking spice and structured by smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",67230
"72159","With this wine, Callaway takes a step away from its longtime Temecula appellation and toward the increasingly well-regarded Coastal designation. The wine is a little oakier than Callaway's previous bottlings and the fruit is lean, tending toward grapefruit and green apple. It's crisp and ultraclean, and a good value.","White","Chardonnay","US",72159
"100733","Young, supple and stylish, this mixes notes of berry, plum and cassis, demonstrating poise and richness. The barrel flavors are smoothly integrated; the finish is rich and dark, with a strong streak of cacao.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",100733
"7609","This opens with dry underbrush, sun-baked soil and French oak aromas. The palate is equally brooding, its dried black cherry and blackberry fruit brushed with licorice and espresso flavors. Assertive, close-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Drink 2020–2027.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",7609
"81626","Produced in vineyards close to Mont Saint-Victoire in the west of the Provence vineyards, this perfumed, floral wine has crisp acidity along with orange and citrus flavors. The wine is light, very fruity and bright at the end.","Rosé","Rosé","France",81626
"90328","Rustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors. Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",90328
"48003","The richness of the fruit from Caillerets is so evident in this scrumptious wine. With its big, bold black fruits, it has sweetness, a soft, generous texture and evocative perfumes. It is so delicious and ready to drink now, that even the acidity that shows through has a hard time reminding us that this wine should age as well.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48003
"35603","The partnership between vintner Bill Price and winemaker Gavin Chanin, Lutum continues to impress, aiming for elegance without giving up flavor or body. Tightly wound, a signature perhaps of the vintage, this wine is still subtle, suggesting rhubarb and cherry atop forest floor. Smooth, it hides elusive power on the significant finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35603
"6074","Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it.","Red","Zinfandel","US",6074
"94290","Dry and firm in tannins, this has upfront blackberry, cherry, oak and spice flavors. It's a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend with some Syrah, which brings a smoked meat taste.","Red","Red Blend","US",94290
"55206","A very nice Cab made in the Paso style. It's soft, dry and spicy, a round, supple wine with flavors of black currants, raspberries and cedar. Attractive and classy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55206
"106305","A 50-case release from Six Sigma, this Sauvignon Blanc is fleshy, dark and complex, complete with lime, lemon and guava tones. It'll stand up to creamy shellfish dishes or a platter of fresh oysters—an intense study in barrel-kissed Lake County Sauvignon Blanc.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",106305
"50133","Dark in color and in flavor profile, this medium-bodied Cornas boasts aromas and flavors reminiscent of chocolate fudge, espresso and plummy fruit, all framed by soft, dusty tannins. Drink now–2025.","Red","Syrah","France",50133
"65673","Good structure on this dry table wine, with firm tannins and cleansing acidity. But there's not a whole lot of flavor, with watered-down notes of blackberries.","Red","Merlot","US",65673
"6463","Linear and intense, this elegant blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay opens with aromas of fragrant flowers, yeast and a whiff of orchard fruit. The firm, focused palate delivers ripe apple, citrus zest, almond and energizing mineral notes alongside an ultrafine, persistent perlage that carries through to the quenching, bone dry finish. It's overflowing with finesse.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",6463
"43963","Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",43963
"22069","Though not treating the grape with quite the same reverence as other varieties, Central Coast vintners are having fun with Merlot, making quaffable, easygoing bottlings like this one. It shows caramelized blueberry, black currant and asphalt touches on the nose. The graphite minerality also pops on the palate, giving a tension to the cassis flavors.","Red","Merlot","US",22069
"84072","Enticing aromas of iris, rose, perfumed red berry and cake spice emerge on this stunning wine. The elegantly structured, silky palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, mint, white pepper and tobacco alongside firm but ultrafine tannins. It's already tempting but hold to let it unwind and develop more complexity. Drink 2018–2035.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",84072
"92916","This Bordeaux blend is soft and somewhat sweet, with jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors accented with oak and tannins. It seems at its best now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",92916
"43374","This is a structured, full-bodied wine that has solid tannins and concentrated fruitiness. It is packed with red-berry flavors, ripe tannins and spice from the wood aging. The wine will take time to develop. Drink from 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",43374
"79320","A beautiful sparkling wine, rich and refined in the mouth, with creamy flavors that show ripe, sweet California strawberries and limes. This bottling gets better and better with each new release.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",79320
"21206","There's an impressive freshness to this seven-year-old bottling, with both just-picked and baked blackberry aromas alongside pressed violets and dried ginger on the lavish nose. Vibrant olallieberries show on the sip, with violet-flavored cake adding to this study of purple flavors.","Red","G-S-M","US",21206
"44192","Black fruits, earth notes and a hint of toast create a subtle, inviting nose. In the mouth, this is chunky but balanced, with mild tannins. Cassis and plum are the lead flavors, and the finish is mellow and fleshy in feel, with a certain lazy ease to it.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",44192
"75432","Tough and earthy, with gritty tannins framing tobacco, black cherry and oak flavors. A good everyday Cab from this warmish appellation.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",75432
"72815","Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness.","White","Chardonnay","US",72815
"40154","A wine that is both creamy and has a tight, steely core. It will be fine with food, with its crisp apple acidity and a squeeze of lemon. Drink now.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",40154
"13895","Aromas of banana, tropical fruits and spun sugar set up a weighty, citrusy palate with flavors of fresh-squeezed orange juice and grapefruit. Fruity from front to back.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",13895
"43486","With fruit hailing mostly from Sonoma (83%), this Overlook also sources from Monterey (11%) and Santa Barbara counties (6%) to craft a barrel-influenced wine that's intense in caramel, lemon and vanilla sugar, rich yet balanced.","White","Chardonnay","US",43486
"78899","This salmon-colored rosé is past its peak. Gritty aromas are turning oily, while the feel is chunky and sticky, with a touch of lasting citric acidity. Flavors of melon and almond skins finish bitter.","Rosé","Rosé","Argentina",78899
"58828","This medium-bodied wine is tightly structured and bracingly acidic, yet doesn't lack for ripeness or fruit. Guava, gooseberry and grapefruit are all present from aromatic start to lengthy, focused finish. It's a crisp, refreshing counterpoint to some of Marlborough's softer styles of Sauvignon Blanc.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",58828
"42966","This is a polished Chardonnay, fruity in Meyer lemon and lime yet mellow and honeyed on the palate, buoyed by tight acidity and just enough spice. There's a balance of depth and breadth to this wine, and a lengthy finish. Some fruit comes from 40-year-old vines planted to Heritage Selections of the Robert Young clone.","White","Chardonnay","US",42966
"70176","Soft, and dancing in strong, present acidity, this wine honors the vineyard site in its bright, fresh components of rhubarb and pomegranate. Within the freshness and savory seasonings of sage and black tea, it remains boldly robust and ripe, with plenty of density.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70176
"81762","Here's an easy, well-valued red blend of Refosco, Raboso and other indigenous grapes from the Verona area with an approachable, no-fuss disposition and aromas of blueberry, forest floor and lingering sweet spice. It has plush berry flavors and a gritty, raw texture.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",81762
"4864","A rough, pinchy nose with leather and funk is no way to begin. The palate stays hard and spiky, with burnt, rustic, murky flavors. Roasted and mossy on the finish, and not very good overall.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",4864
"12344","NH is making a heritage blend here from 50% Carignane, 30% Zinfandel from the Big John Vineyard and 20% Petite Sirah from Dalton Vineyard, all grown in Calaveras County. Superfull in body and texture, the blend is high in ripe raspberry and plum, Zin-spicy with savory cedar and smokiness too.","Red","Red Blend","US",12344
"41544","A Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now, this has a pleasingly tart yet creamy mouthfeel, with rich, complex flavors of tropical fruit, lemongrass, peach and vanilla that finish in a swirl of peppery spice.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",41544
"47965","Some foliage aromas are echoed in the mouth along with dark fruit and banana. Medium weight and structured tannins provide a full body, leading into a strong but somewhat waxy finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",47965
"47537","This is a muscular wine. Intensely colored and redolent of superripe fruit, it nevertheless remains firm and structured from start to long, dusty finish. It's almost grapy in its intensity, but also hints at coffee and cocoa along the way. Drink it now if you like your Pinots big and bold, or hold it through 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",47537
"51830","Prickly, briny stone-fruit aromas are citrusy and largely fresh. This offers weight, grab and texture on the palate along with briny orange and grapefruit flavors. A slightly salty finish with notes of green herbs closes it out.","White","Verdejo","Spain",51830
"35852","With a creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of tangerines, tropical fruits, honey and sweet oak, this is a flashy effort. It will appeal to fans of the variety, and rightfully so, delivering a dry complexity that lifts it way above the average.","White","Chardonnay","US",35852
"29064","This is well made, in a light, pale, tart style. The ample acidity boosts sour cherry fruit, keeping the wine sporty and fresh. It would make a fine match to salmon or turkey.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",29064
"72607","Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",72607
"26946","This is an unoaked Chardonnay, but it's so rich and forward in fruit, you may not even miss that smoky wood edge. Explodes with pineapple, peach, pear, apple, vanilla, honey and dusty spice flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",26946
"27355","This wine is a blend of 40% each Mourvèdre and Syrah along with 15% Petite Sirah and 5% Viognier. Aromas of orange zest, flowers, raw meat and peppery spices lead to a soft palate, full of citrus flavors that seem a bit out of balance but that still provide intrigue.","Red","Red Blend","US",27355
"31763","The aromas of huckleberry, flowers and blueberry are bright, with a dark-chocolate top note. The palate is full bodied and rich, made in a hedonistic style with a tart finish.","Red","Syrah","US",31763
"64290","This is indeed a very enjoyable Chianti Classico that shows bright fruit nuances of cherry and blackberry followed by spice, leather and dried tobacco. In the mouth, the wine is smooth, medium in intensity but also bright and fresh.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",64290
"63842","Penetrating tones of stone, lemon and wax lend a stately feel to this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. It's full-bodied in style with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, but invigorated with acidity on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",63842
"63891","Aromas of graphite, tobacco, cedary oak, plum and mixed berry fruits are harmonious and appealing. This Cabernet-led blend feels fresh, with good layering on the palate. Flavors of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, spice and cassis end with chocolaty berry richness floating on top of bright acidity. Drink through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",63891
"47099","This forward wine opens with funky aromas of game and leather, with a whiff of barnyard. The palate is evolved and much of the fruit has already dried up, leaving bitter prune alongside green, astringent tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",47099
"28450","Rich but refined, it opens with an enticing floral fragrance of white roses and stone fruit. The fresh palate offers white peach, tropical fruit, pineapple and pink grapefruit accented with clove and nutmeg.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",28450
"29228","Now mature, this ripe wine has a creamy texture that is cut with the steely acidity of Chablis. Yellow fruits and a bright aftertaste keep this wine in the fruity stage. The aftertaste, though, has a more leafy character that shows its maturity. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",29228
"101523","This wine is dusty on the nose, with aromas of red pepper flake, citrus and red fruits. It's fleshy in the mouth and showing grip along with flavors of pomegranate, pink grapefruit and tangerine. Solid, cleansing and dry on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",101523
"71251","Water Wheel's 2005 Shiraz is a full-bodied, creamy-textured effort filled with the scents and flavors of dark plums, vanilla and coffee. It's delicious now, but should evolve through 2020, thanks to its concentrated fruit and ample tannins.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",71251
"45929","This Pinot is aromatic; rhubarb, dried raspberry, rubber, prickly herbal notes and spice scents all vie for attention. This is solid and creamy in feel, with cutting acidity and herbal, lightly leafy flavors of dried, spicy red fruits. A lightly herbal tasting finish is the finale.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",45929
"58924","Fresh, full bodied and juicy, this has flavors of dusty, dark plum and chocolate. It was aged in both French and American oak, which has added a background note of tobacco and vanilla on the palate, particularly on the finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",58924
"26195","Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.","White","Chardonnay","US",26195
"17754","Rosé Chiaretto Pergola (made mostly with Groppello grapes) opens with a vinous note of fresh grapes and raspberry followed by almond skin and white mushroom. It's an easy, no-fuss wine with a zesty, acidic finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Italy",17754
"50405","A sharp entry brings a clear-cut diesel component into focus. The golden apple fruit is penetrating and ripe, with some bitterness in the follow-through.","White","Pinot Gris","US",50405
"64151","While not a declared vintage Port year, it did produce some impressive old tawnies, like this. It is such a balanced wine, fresh with ripe marmalade, raisin and old wood flavors. It has a wonderful milk chocolate aftertaste that is contrasted with its still-fresh acidity. Drink now.","Port","Port","Portugal",64151
"28468","Named in tribute to the many wine rivers of Portugal (Foz means estuary), this generous, fruity and soft wine is quite ready to drink. It is smooth with black fruits and light tannins well balanced and cut by acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",28468
"14405","This Long Island Petit Verdot is lighter on its feet and a shade brighter in style than most of its peers. Ripe but restrained black-cherry and plum flavors are accented by hints of cedar and bramble. The finish is marked by fine but slightly bitter tannins that should meld nicely by 2020.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",14405
"67929","This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5–6 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67929
"48111","This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (66%), Syrah (23%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of violets, black licorice, dried blackberries and dark fruit are followed by ripe, full-bodied dark fruit and baking-spice flavors. The tannins pack a hefty but still well-balanced punch.","Red","Red Blend","US",48111
"79050","Apple notes play with citrus overtones on this superfresh and light wine. This is a summer wine with great refreshment potential: light and lifted with spritzy citrus.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",79050
"37403","Fans of toast, butterscotch and butter will gulp this down happily, but these reviewers are sad to see the wine's fruit get lost beneath it all. Finishes like caramel candy; smells like buttered whole wheat toast. Will certainly have its appeal, but we'd like to see the fruit center stage next vintage.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",37403
"73014","The back label notes that this fruit is from the Whistling Ridge Vineyard. It's rich and concentrated, a mix of apple, pear and green banana. Creamy and dense, it coats the mouth and lingers deliciously.","White","Chardonnay","US",73014
"30124","Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this straw colored Metodo Classico opens with subdued aromas of nut and a whiff of bread crust. The palate is more expressive, offering white peach, citrus zest and pastry notes alongside a creamy mousse. An almond note closes the finish.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",30124
"16593","Two of the crispest and most savory white varieties in California are Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris/Grigio, and this blend of both shows the best qualities of each. It's just slightly off-dry and vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and vanilla flavors, with beautiful acidity.","White","White Blend","US",16593
"51840","There's nothing flashy about this dry, delicately framed Riesling. It's quietly elegant, focused on pristine lemon and lime flavors, along with bitter citrus pith on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",51840
"41313","Firmly on the rustic side, this Zin is hot and peppery. It's also slightly sweet and sour, with spicy flavors of soy sauce, mashed cherries and blackberries, candied ginger, balsamic vinegar and tabasco. This controversial wine, which hails from a famous old vineyard, will have its fans.","Red","Zinfandel","US",41313
"96454","The wood aging is still showing in this young wine that needs time. Dry, firm and toasty, it also has the light, fruity character of the 2013 vintage with raspberry, blueberry and acidity that's still too intense. Drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",96454
"97441","This 100% Syrah wine opens with ripe black-skinned fruit, roasted coffee, leather and cedar aromas. The full-bodied, concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, espresso, white pepper and star anise flavors, bolstered by ample, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2021.","Red","Syrah","Italy",97441
"80152","Dry and soft. It's a good Cabernet for everyday drinking, with pleasant berry flavors and a smooth mouthfeel.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80152
"48584","From the start, the aromas of cassis, dark cherry, leather and coffee grounds are medium in intensity, but with time they gain steam. Medium in body, this Merlot has firm tannins that are balanced by uplifting acids. The spiced plum flavor veers into the medium-long finish, which tastes like pink roses sprinkled with ground coffee beans.","Red","Merlot","US",48584
"82797","Grassy aromas feature a note of green banana and yeast. This feels round but hardly chunky, with reasonable core acidity. Flavors of citrus and apple are simple and clean, while a lemon-lime note and a hint of honey take care of the ending.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",82797
"30338","There is a green, raw wood character to this wine, with additional notes of green apple, strawberry hull and beeswax. The medium-weight palate offers a bitter orange-peel flavor alongside crisp apple and melon rind. Drink now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",30338
"38309","Another very good Grenache-Syrah blend from this winery, continuing a string of successful bottlings. The wine is notable for its lush cherry, blackberry, cassis, licorice and spice flavors, and for a superb structure comprised of refined tannins and crisp acidity.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",38309
"62025","A return to 100% varietal Pinot Gris, this is done in a vivid, leesy style, with excellent texture and depth of flavor. Clean and fresh herb, celery, jicama and melon flavors abound, just hinting at white peach at the far end of its gentle ripeness. The flavor penetration and overall crisp definition are very fine.","White","Pinot Gris","US",62025
"68563","The nose of Concord grapes is immediately appealing and leads to notes of overripe raspberries. Substantial residual sugar in combination with medium acidity render this a good for pool-side sipping or with paté.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",68563
"96210","This well-oaked, smoky wine is a great value. It has abundant baking spice aromas, as well as rich flavors of ripe pear, nutmeg and vanilla. Ample acidity and delicate tannins help maintain balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",96210
"32069","All estate fruit goes into this reserve, which was tasted a few months ahead of its official release. It's tight and herbal, with stiff tannins streaked with tobacco and vanilla. Give it another year or two of bottle age, and drink 2018 to 2022.","Red","Tempranillo","US",32069
"56643","Just mature, this smooth, velvet-textured wine has juicy black fruits with a smoky character that adds interest to the structure and acidity that give the wine shape. Rich while fresh at the end, it is ready to drink.","Red","Red Blend","France",56643
"74005","A five-grape Bordeaux blend, with somewhat generic fruit flavors that show a mix of leaf and raisin characteristics. It's smooth and supple, drinking at its best right now, with finishing highlights of peppery herb.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",74005
"87897","This is typical Pinot Blanc—its warm, fruity and soft with just a touch of spice. The wine has an attractive line of acidity from its pear flavors, making it balanced and ready to drink.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",87897
"52140","Pinot Gris, with its pale-pink skin, is the grape of choice in Reuilly for rosés. With a color that matches pale rosés from Provence, the wine is lightly spicy while also dry. Its balanced acidity is just right. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",52140
"101373","Using grapes sourced from a Red Mountain vineyard, this pure Cabernet seems to have been overripened. Notes of raisin and prune appear on the nose and palate, and the mouthfeel is chalky and a bit flat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101373
"12337","This is an unusual mix of both Rhône and Bordeaux grapes—46% Mourvèdre, 19% Syrah, 13% Cabernet, 11% Grenache, 7% Merlot and 4% Malbec. It comes together in a somewhat diffuse red with good balance, good fruit and highlights of barrel and spice. Very tasty, just not particularly focused.","Red","Red Blend","US",12337
"39444","This is a gorgeously floral and herbal wine nuanced in curvy minerality that both defines it and allows it to support lovely accents of apricot and peach.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",39444
"57256","This wine has fruit but it is overwhelmed by the darkly tannic structure. It is concentrated and dense, with signs of extraction giving a hard edge. The Aubert family has been on the Bordeaux Right Bank for two centuries and currently owns six estates. Consulting oenologist is Michel Rolland.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",57256
"106345","Forest floor, truffle, baked plum, eucalyptus and baking spice unfold on this structured red. The linear, elegant palate offers dried black cherry, clove, ground pepper and tobacco framed in polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",106345
"23032","Bone dry, earthy and leathery, this Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon seems a bit tired. The fruit is showing early signs of fading, and the tannins—earthy, green and a bit rough—may already be taking over. Some earthy, organic, almost biodynamic flavors come out in the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",23032
"35327","A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with scents that suggest dark berry, sunbaked earth and cooking spice. The medium-bodied palate offers mature Marasca cherry, raspberry, toast and a sprinkling of clove alongside dusty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",35327
"42681","A creamy, faux-smelling-and-tasting wine with loads of bogus oak character and limited stuffing or quality backing it up. Smells like a berry marshmallow or county fair cotton candy, yet the palate is hollow and sour. A masked wine that's trying to be tricky and isn't.","Red","Merlot","Chile",42681
"86746","Tarry aromas of blackberry and freshly applied asphalt set up a full-bodied palate with sandpaper tannins. Blackberry and toast flavors taste a little burnt, while an oak-based blackened element is present on a stout finish. Drink this blocky and lusty Malbec through 2023.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",86746
"9594","Oak, ripe pear and caramel dance to the fore of this wine's bouquet, followed by thick, textural layers of lingering vanilla cream. The oak remains pronounced throughout the glass, giving the wine a sweetness on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",9594
"27624","Husch has been making Gewurztraminer for a long time and has it down pat. This is an excellent example of a dry, floral wine that's fun enough for an outdoor summer concert and serious enough for a winter's lunch. It smells and tastes floral, peachy and a little nutty, with medium body and good acidity to balance it.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",27624
"10724","Despite lots of ripe black cherry, blueberry and plum flavors, this is a fairly rustic wine, with some edgy tannins making it feel prickly. A bit sweet, it will pair up with Mexican beef and pork dishes.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",10724
"55432","Squeezed lime, pear shavings and poached apple arise on the nose of this bottling. There is a tingling and tactile acidity on the sip, but only very light flavors of green pear and lime rind.","White","Chardonnay","US",55432
"67532","Black cherry, crushed concrete and spicy peppercorn show on the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah dessert blend. There are luscious ripe flavors on the palate, including crème de cassis, black plum and prune, with a gravel-like minerality lending elegance. The high alcohol is well integrated.","Red","Red Blend","US",67532
"41106","Structured and still dry with young tannins, this concentrated wine has the potential of fresh black currant fruits. For the moment, it is dark, showing some bitter chocolate flavors that need to soften. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",41106
"5154","Dense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding. There is depth and power here, but it must be extracted over time and with a bit of patience.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5154
"13989","Phil Sexton's wines under the Giant Steps label are becoming more consistent, and the 2014s may be his best yet. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, with a supple, creamy texture and lingering notes of spring flowers and black cherries. Subtle oaking adds brown sugar and mocha shadings to the crisp finish. Drink now–2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",13989
"63957","This is elegant and layered, with notes of savory smoked meat, spice, dark fruit, blackberry and leather. It shows a very dark, brooding and masculine personality with polished tannins and impressive length.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",63957
"14737","There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14737
"14362","Woody, lightly oxidized aromas of Cream of Wheat and pool water give way to pure wood grain. This feels both resiny and briny, with unabsorbed, raw flavors of barrel oak, salt and sawdust. Lemony, tart notes enter on the finish, but overall this Viura-Malvasia-Garnacha Blanca blend is so woody it's like licking a fresh-cut plank.","White","White Blend","Spain",14362
"82673","This 100% varietal aged 22 months in French oak (22% new) needs time to open up. Once it does, it brings notes of dried herbs, dark coffee, cherry, plum and pencil eraser. It's elegant in style while showing good concentration to the chocolate and cherry flavors, supported by lightly chalky tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",82673
"47695","Locked down by hard tannins, this nonetheless is a beautiful Zinfandel, dry and rich in flavor. It bursts with savory wild berry, tobacco, mocha and pepper flavors, and feels elegant and refined. The tannins call for enormously rich beef, pasta, sauces and cheeses.","Red","Zinfandel","US",47695
"57846","Exceptionally ripe and rich with blackberry and blueberry jam, raisin,  cocoa and peppery spice flavors, this Zin is also hot with alcohol. It's a big, robust, rustic, Port-like wine for drinking now, especially with barbecue.","Red","Zinfandel","US",57846
"87740","Stalky, medicinal, rubbery aromas announce an acidic Tempranillo-led blend that's downright astringent on the palate. Flavors of stalky fruit, buttery oak and sheer raspberry and plum end crisp and tight, with a salty flavor.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",87740
"68535","Celebrating the foundation of Cheval Quancard in 1844, this is a solid, dense and well-made wine from ripe grapes. The balance is good with tannins already integrating well into the juicy, ripe acidity. It's ready to drink but will age at least until 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",68535
"4530","The four soils designation refers to the wine's origins in different vineyards throughout the valley. A great followup to the marvelous 2009, the wine showcases artful blending. It's incredibly rich and ripe in black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak, yet balanced in acids and tannins. Drink now and through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4530
"310","Richly textured, viscous but with good acidty for balance. The wine shows pretty melon, citrus, herb, grass, peach and spice flavors and features a mineral edge that is fresh and clean at the end.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",310
"68336","Good price for a Cabernet of this quality, and one that's been aged for four-plus years. It's soft and mellow and drinkable now, with enjoyable blackberry, currant, licorice, spice and cedar flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",68336
"82481","Aromas of mature plum, French oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the way. The full-bodied palate offers vanilla, espresso, coconut, sour cherry and grilled herb alongside assertive close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",82481
"23763","There's a steely polish to this laser-focused dry Riesling. Crisp apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors are refreshing, but serve more as a backdrop to intense minerality. It's a brisk yet penetrating wine with a long, linear finish. Drink now–2017.","White","Riesling","US",23763
"99721","A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",99721
"87513","Tarry, stalky aromas fail to make much of a statement. This is high in acid and rugged in the mouth, with a mixture of herbal red-fruit flavors and distinct stalkiness. A grating finish is racy and hot.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",87513
"78363","Though still exploring the zesty acid-driven side of Pinot Noir, Marc Piro adds depth and richness to this bottling. Red cherry compote and cordial meet fennel, dill, tarragon and tapenade on the nose. The extremely lively and fresh palate unleashes an array of flower petals, just-pressed tart berries and Kalamata olives. A deep structure and thorough acidity complete the picture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78363
"20395","A toasty but green-smelling bouquet mixes scents of grass with charred oak and berry fruits. A creamy, lactic palate deals flavors of green herbs, mint and milk chocolate, all of which carry over to a minty finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",20395
"40862","A Chardonnay of heightened acidity, this is fresh, light and banced, with tastes of lemon and pear.","White","Chardonnay","US",40862
"81752","As in 2003, the blend is 78% Syrah, 22% Sangiovese, all from the Seven Hills vineyard, and aged in 70% new Hungarian oak. The wine looks and tastes a bit oxidative, the fruit is soft and simple, the finish lightly toasty.","Red","Syrah","US",81752
"25323","Fine perlage and foamy mousse characterize this delicate Prosecco Superiore as it is poured into the glass. Beyond that soft, creamy appearance, this fresh sparkler offers flavors of peach, citrus and honeydew melon.","White","Glera","Italy",25323
"86806","Scattered aromas of horseradish, cotton candy and vinegar are all over the map but don't convey varietal character or purity. This new wine from terraced vineyards in deep, rural Maule feels clipped, with heavy tannins. Mixed berry flavors are bitter and rubbery, and the finish is grabby and awkward. This is a first release; suffice it to say it needs more work to justify its price.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",86806
"87631","This plush, silky wine is a thrill ride from start to finish. Asphalt and black olive notes on the nose give it a rather rustic edge to start, but purer peppery notes emerge with air. And once past the funk, this shows layers of blueberry and mulberry fruit, maybe even a trace of apricot to go along with savory notes of olive and espresso that glide gracefully through the long, silky finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Syrah","New Zealand",87631
"56050","One of a pair of wines that are named after the soils on which the vines grow, this comes from clay and chalk earth on the terraces of the Lot river. It is structured and still dense, needing several years to mature. Packed tannins still lie over the generous ripe fruits. Drink from 2019.","Red","Malbec","France",56050
"83171","A powerful expression of Portuguese varieties, with dense tannins, dark fruit flavors and ripeness. If the alcohol is too high—and it shows in the pepper edge to the wine—it still has a sense of shape and structure.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",83171
"35659","This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",35659
"92686","At first, this is plump on the nose, with cherries and warm star anise. Aromas of dried plum skins, orange rind and bitter black tea then reveal layers of complexity. Light in body and energetic on the palate, it shows strong peppery spice against the tart red fruit, making for a very lively experience.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92686
"78700","This is a richly honeyed wine that has flavors of spice cake and sweet fruits that are balanced with a taut, firm texture. The wine is ripe, but has a delicate touch that makes it very attractive. Drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",78700
"77874","Light and fruity, the wine has a smooth edge that is cut with acidity. It is an immediately accessible wine with a lzesty lemon finish.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",77874
"62559","Details of tea leaf, peach skin and pear introduce a wine with tremendous texture and length. The off-dry sweetness is counterbalanced by tart acidity, creating perfect tension and continuing into a lingering, satisfying finish. As with all these young wines, this will improve dramatically with ample aeration.","White","Riesling","US",62559
"104427","Thin and weedy, with minty cherry flavors that finish dry and sharp in acids. A decent introductory wine for those new to the variety.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104427
"10239","This shows real Sauvignon character in its brisk, mouthwatering acidity. Its green grass and gooseberry notes accompany riper lemon and lime fruit.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",10239
"23627","This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.","White","Pinot Gris","US",23627
"8339","A pretty good Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, with crisp acidity and a backbone of tannins. The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8339
"28946","Not a wine for drinking now or anytime soon. It's so hard in tannins, it basically locks down the palate, and the astringency seems to accentuate the acidity and dryness. However, there is a deep core of blackberry essence and, after all, this is Montelena. All indications are that it will be a terrific wine in another 8 or 10 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",28946
"11716","Made from the same blend as the dry Orvieto, in this version fermentation is stopped before all the sugars are converted to alcohol. A moderately sweet wine, it boasts apricot, honey and almond notes, with just enough acidity to avoid a cloying finish. Pair it with cream cheeses or almond cookies.","White","White Blend","Italy",11716
"17084","Leather, game, wet soil and ripe berry aromas take center stage on this savory blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nero d'Avola. The lively, easy-drinking palate delivers ripe black cherry and raspberry, accented by white pepper and mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens up the dense fruit.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",17084
"46620","Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",46620
"105475","So fresh and balanced, there's structured mineral-driven support to the red apple, juicy lemon and sweet spice flavors. Medium weight, the ripe mouth is coupled with great acidity to cut through any flab. A soft toastiness kicks up the finish.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",105475
"67535","This easy-to-love wine from the Michael Mondavi family has an obvious but attractive oaky character, from the abundant cedar and cinnamon aromas to the spicy nutmeg and cardamom flavors that bolster its red cherry fruit and medium body.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",67535
"34240","The dry style of this firm and earthy-tasting wine should be great paired with rich proteins. It shows black currant and dark chocolate flavors dusted with cedar. Medium bodied and moderately tannic, it has good balance and a lingering finish. Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah are the two main elements of the blend.","Red","Red Blend","US",34240
"53533","Spice and mint dominate this intensely aromatic wine. Solid and very structured, it is still showing its wood aging and extraction. But its bright future is certain, with the weight of black fruits, the firm tannins and the mineral texture. Guard this wine and don't drink before 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",53533
"13083","Sourced from the Gamble Ranch in Oakville, this is a fleshy, full-figured wine, floral in honeysuckle and voluptuous in youthful oak. Gravensteins apple is overtaken by the richness of butterscotch and tropical pineapple before a brightness comes to life on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",13083
"100985","Preda is a solid and dense expression of Barolo with oak-related notes of vanilla and spice that need a few more years to integrate fully. The quality of the fruit is evident and with 10 more years of cellar aging all those elegant Nebbiolo aromas of licorice and white truffle should shine through.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",100985
"62820","Aromas of black-skinned fruit, baking spice and mocha lead the nose while the ripe palate offers black plum, vanilla and tobacco. Assertive tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. Drink through 2019.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",62820
"69402","Even after five years, this wine still shows its primary fruit—black plums, sweet but structured. Callabriga, a Tinta Roriz based wine, goes light on the acidity, but the tannins and the hints of vanilla balance well with the blackberry jam fruits.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",69402
"63600","A totally refreshing blend of citrus, apple, peach and pear flavors, all couched in bright textured acidity. The wine makes a fine aperitif as well as a mealtime beverage. Off dry, but hardly sweet, it's crisp and fresh to the end.","White","Riesling","US",63600
"88754","Here is a splendid example of this variety, intensely spicy, with the characteristic scents and flavors of rose petals, lychee fruit and baby powder. It shows tremendous depth and precision, and could be cellared through 2020, but why wait?","White","Gewürztraminer","Canada",88754
"11669","Surprisingly soft, with an easy-drinking roundness to the midpalate, this is a bit of a butter cookie Chardonnay despite the INOX (stainless steel) moniker. The pretty fruit is the highlight.","White","Chardonnay","US",11669
"96676","This wine is ripe, with attractive red cherry fruit flavors. It bursts with fruitiness, fresh acidity and just the lightest structure.","Red","Gamay","France",96676
"75899","A single-vineyard wine, this is firmly structured and full of perfumed fruit. New wood aging gives the red berry fruit a smoky, toasty character. It's a rich, concentrated selection to age for five years or more.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",75899
"35465","This wine displays aromas of green herbs, black and green olive, vanilla and sweet plum. The black and blue fruit flavors are sweet, backed by blocky, dry tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",35465
"47952","Aromas of cherry, plum and flint introduce this fun Merlot from South Africa. Elegant, soft and supple on the palate, this offers good fruit flavors and a pleasant finish. Not terribly complex but certainly enjoyable. Imported by Cape Wine Ventures, LLC.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",47952
"58047","Another outstanding Renwood vineyard designate, this has great structure and abundant fruit flavors without overt oakiness. Full-bodied, smooth and seamless, exudes a wild berry and mineral character in the aroma and flavor, and keeps everything in balance due to moderate tannins and acidity.","Red","Zinfandel","US",58047
"74448","From a 3.5-acre block planted in 1978, which makes it Santa Barbara County's first Syrah, this bottling shows an intriguing density of flowers on the nose along with a funky compost note, elderberry fruit, pine needles and fresh mint. Cracked peppercorn, dried thyme and rosemary combine for strong herbal intrigue on the palate, spicing up the black plum and blackberry fruit.","Red","Syrah","US",74448
"7025","Aromas of fragrant blue flower and wild berry waft out of the glass. The easygoing no-frills palate offers juicy wild cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. It's enjoyable but already accessible and extremely straightforward by Brunello standards. Drink through 2019.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",7025
"91781","Fresh green sage and tarragon notes lend an herbaceous freshness to this elegant off-dry Riesling. It's dancingly delicate on the palate, but sunny yellow cherry and tangerine flavors are bright and concentrated.","White","Riesling","US",91781
"46085","This is a rich and heady Cabernet from head to toe. Solid, ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are coated with oaky coconut scents. In the mouth, this is saturated and heavy to the point of being syrupy. Flavors of chocolate, oaky char and herbal berry flavors finish smoky and spicy. Drink through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",46085
"69635","A pale pink color introduces this wine, as do fairly weak aromas of bubble gum and freshly squeezed lime. This is one of three rosés made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.","Rosé","Rosé","US",69635
"81191","Strawberries are the core of the fruit here, with plenty of acidity behind. The wine thins out quickly in the midpalate, and finishes high-toned and lightly fruity.","Red","Barbera","US",81191
"25561","Situated in the McMinnville AVA, this vineyard delivers a sleek, well-proportioned wine. Though tight and unyielding at first, it is aromatically promising, with a mix of rose petals, berries and chocolate. Those flavors expand as it breathes open, finishing with the AVA's characteristic gun-metal minerality. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25561
"23703","Full bodied with a generously ripe black cherry and crème de cassis profile, this Petit Verdot (with just a hint of Merlot and Cab thrown in) is beautifully structured with a sturdy frame of tannins and minerality with shining tones of graphite and pencil lead.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",23703
"96481","This crisp, easy-drinking entry-level Riesling from the Peter Nicolay estate represents a good buy. It's plump, with a nice balance of sweet and tart ripe apples and zesty limes that provide great refreshment value.","White","Riesling","Germany",96481
"67339","Plump blackberry, dark strawberry, dried herbs and baking spice show on the nose of this well-rounded and easily likable bottling. The palate mixes fleshy red and purple fruit with a strong chaparral component in the midpalate. The firm grippy texture makes this a more serious Zinfandel than most.","Red","Zinfandel","US",67339
"69248","Situated at the southern end of the Haut-Médoc, close to Margaux, this estate has produced a warm, ripe wine. The tannins are very present, still young and up-front. However the rich red-berry and black-currant fruits have plenty of weight to allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",69248
"4398","Cherries and chocolate are the hallmark of the Zins at Maryhill. The fruit is pretty and the chocolate smooth, certainly a crowd-pleasing style. The finish is clean and supple.","Red","Zinfandel","US",4398
"28449","This old-vine (planted 1972) Pinot offers delicate, yet complex details throughout the palate. It's elegant winemaking at its best—a pinpoint mix of herb, stone, berry and barrel—seamless and precise. Despite (or perhaps because of?) the low alcohol, this has the potential to age; try after 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28449
"67972","This is an off-dry wine, full of fruit and crisp acidity. It has a soft texture and touches of tropical fruit. The wine comes from vineyards in the south of Vinho Verde, close to the Douro.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",67972
"27772","This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",27772
"47960","A good effort given the price. Although the nose is a little bland, the wine is clean and shows hints of pear and sweet grapefruit. The palate is wet and not overly concentrated, so things flow easily as it delivers tepid lime and citrus flavors. A lightweight made for limited-thought quaffing, which is exactly what you should expect for eight bucks.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",47960
"87306","Primitivo is a close relation to Zinfandel, and it slides easily into the Angel Vine lineup which includes four other Zins. This carries a touch more earthiness than the others, with darker fruits and a distinctive streak of espresso. Good grip and density mark this as the most muscular wine among the 2011's.","Red","Primitivo","US",87306
"31044","This has a dark ruby appearance, opening with succulent aromas of black cherry, bitter chocolate and licorice. It boasts loads of intensity and a youthful, astringent quality to its tannins. Let it age 10 years or more.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",31044
"91613","Thick on the nose in black pepper and garrigue, this wine is velvety in layers of berry and cherry, with a hearty tobacco chaser. Concentrated and duly ripe, it brightens in the glass to show compelling bursts of white pepper and violet.","Red","Syrah","US",91613
"90718","This is a selection from parcels on the Rimauresq estate. Well balanced, it has enough weight and texture to be food-friendly. Intense red fruits dominate, put easily against fresh acidity that finishes the wine with a lift.","Rosé","Rosé","France",90718
"64751","This is a wood-aged Touriga Nacional that is smooth and rich. It shows some extraction offering dark chocolate flavors that cover the fruit, yet happen to provide a ripe, rounded feel. Drink from 2017.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",64751
"34930","Shows jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries, lightly touched with sweet, smoky oak. It's a bit rough in tannins, with some green notes, but at this price, a pretty good value.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",34930
"23624","Earthy berry and raisin aromas announce a warm, ripe wine. This feels plump, grapy and chunky, with moderate acidity. Grapy, bold flavors of raspberry, prune and cherry are earthy and loamy, while ripeness and a raisiny element carry onto the finish. Drink through 2019.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",23624
"15421","An atypically oaky wine for Siduri, with a rich veneer of French oak overlying black cherries, cola and spice. The intensity builds on the palate, where root beer and black cherries culminate in a long, smoky-spicy finish. Needs a couple of years to pull itself together, but the raw materials are all there.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15421
"89906","Here's an everyday wine to drink with burgers and such. Tastes like an inexpensive wine served in a fast-food restaurant.","Red","Red Blend","US",89906
"93650","Light cherry and strawberry aromas and flavors go with a medium-body and grippy texture to make this wine rather tight on the palate. It's a good, versatile lunch and dinner drink because the supportive tannins and acidity will pair nicely with food.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93650
"20718","A blend of Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval vineyards aged in 50% new French oak, this wine brings brooding notes of blackberry bramble, blueberry, mineral, herbs and potpourri. The palate-coating blue-fruit flavors are exceptionally dense, rich and sweet and lead to a hyper-extended finish.","Red","Syrah","US",20718
"84198","The winery held this back for four years before releasing it. While it's dry and silky on the palate, it has raisiny flavors, and a touch of volatile acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84198
"101655","Heavy butter, toast and caramel aromas and flavors give this wine a lot of impact, while the fruitiness is mild and the mouthfeel is soft.","White","Chardonnay","US",101655
"69422","This wine is a blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (40%), Petit Verdot (10%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of savory herb, carob, wood spice and cherry lead to plump fruit-forward flavors that also show intriguing earthy accents. The finish lingers. There are lots of good things going on but the wood seems a bit prominent.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",69422
"32653","Apple and citrus fruit carries a light and refreshing hint of wintergreen. This is a solid, fruity, no-frills, chillable style of Chardonnay.","White","Chardonnay","US",32653
"29845","This wine is off dry, with honey and lemon flavors cut with tight acidity. Young and fruity, this simple wine is ready to drink.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",29845
"21331","Searingly tart, this might be a 2007 Muscadet for its thrilling, stiletto-steel spine and leesy minerality. Simply calling it unoaked does not begin to do justice to the complexity and textural density that this unusual Oregon Chardonnay offers. For acid lovers who don't think that Chardonnay must be slathered in toasty new wood in order to have any flavor, this wine will be a joy.","White","Chardonnay","US",21331
"69077","Mossy, herbal, baked-berry aromas are accented by shades of green tones. On the palate, this is lively but a touch raw, with bold acidity. Blackberry, spiced plum, oak and herbal, grassy flavors finish snappy.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",69077
"47045","With a nose of citrus and mineral and a fresh palate, this is nothing but pleasing. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine, lime and green apple are direct and lively, while the finish is long and fruity. This is how Verdejo should be.","White","Verdejo","Spain",47045
"98191","Give this pretty Cabernet a brief decant to let it breathe so the tannins can soften a little. It's too soft to age, but offers nice flavors now of blackberries, cherries, mocha, sage, cedar and spices.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",98191
"58722","The color goes from medium garnet in the middle to a light brownish on the rim. It smells like dried cherry, sage and toast, and tastes substantially fruity. The wine feels just structured enough by acidity and tannin for balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58722
"57564","A 50/50 blend of wood-aged Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from selected wines. It is wood-dominated at present, but the fruit feels rich enough to come through shortly, and then it will be an impressively ripe, structured wine. However, it's always going to be a dry, dark and firmly tannic.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",57564
"98638","This pure Touriga Nacional is perfumed, firmly tannic and packed with the tight, mineral character typical of the region. Richly fruity with juicy black currant flavor, it's still developing and will be best from 2019.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",98638
"27752","In its Provence skittle bottle, this wine is a bright mouthful that is as easy on the palate as its pale color is easy on the eye. It is lightly crisp with red fruits and citrus, and is very ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",27752
"21822","Dourthe's 100% Sauvignon Blanc is lively and crisp—a light, bright wine. With its strong citrus flavors, lemon and tangerine, touched by spice, it is balanced and fruity. The texture gives a herbal edge that is attractive and refreshing.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",21822
"22157","This is a soft and creamy wine, ripe with baked apple and crisp pear flavors. Balanced and full in the mouth, it attractive and ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",22157
"17137","There's a steady, balanced approach to this Brunello that sees seamless integration of red fruit, cassis, leather, cola and dried rosemary aromas. Bright acidity only serves to underline its overall liveliness. Very different from the softer 2007 vintage, this wine will appeal to those who appreciate a more traditional style.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",17137
"54061","Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of blue fruit, herb, pencil lead and barrel spice are followed by smooth plum flavors. Milk chocolate notes persist on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",54061
"103463","Almost white in color, this is a rich wine with intense red-currant and raspberry fruits. It is a dry wine, destined to partner food, with fine acidity as well as a herbal edge. It is a concentrated wine, ready to drink from the end of 2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",103463
"33739","This primarily barrel-fermented and barrel-aged Chardonnay offers toasty oak on the nose and a palate rounded out by expressive fruit. Soft and friendly, it has a lingering finish but is not overly complex. Pair wth game birds and seafood.","White","Chardonnay","US",33739
"68067","An almost sweet plum and prune aroma continues to the flavors of this medium-bodied, warm and generous wine. Blended from Sonoma, Amador and Lodi grapes, it offers moderate tannins and a velvety texture.","Red","Zinfandel","US",68067
"94661","Hints of charred wood and fresh-cracked black pepper meet tasty baked-fruit flavors in this full-bodied, rather rugged wine made from Grenache, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a good, firm and moderately tannic texture.","Red","Red Blend","US",94661
"2965","This is the entry-level wine of this estate. It shows a crisp side of Cabernet Franc while keeping all its perfumed character. The wine is structured with young tannins as well which are balanced with acidity and bright red-berry fruits. Drink from 2018.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",2965
"77887","Basic plum and black cherry aromas come with hints of baking spices and cinnamon. This feels a bit high in acidity and pinchy. While a quick wash of grapy, black-fruit flavors finishes without much noise.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",77887
"46443","Subtle aromatics ride a steely frame of straightforward acidity and subtle oak, the wine medium in build and layers. It finishes in a flourish of salty brine.","White","Chardonnay","US",46443
"61016","Made from Nero d'Avola from old, pre-phylloxera vines, this opens with subdued violet, leather and underbrush aromas. The dense, structured palate evokes blackberry jam, vanilla and licorice. Enjoy through 2021.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",61016
"96188","A very soft Riesling, missing the steeliness while gaining ripe white fruits and a fragrant, gentle character. It is attractively structured, though needs a year to age.","White","Riesling","France",96188
"27940","This hearty blend boasts a dark, inky color, with bright aromas of black fruit, cola, dried rosemary, black olive and spice. The finish is thick, concentrated and long lasting.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",27940
"47014","Good concentration and a firm mouthfeel make this full-bodied wine a fine pairing for osso buco or mushroom risotto. It has robust ripe berry, anise and dark chocolate flavors, velvety tannins that seem to coat the palate, and a lingering, rich finish.","Red","Sangiovese","US",47014
"68749","Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve. The palate is crisp, snappy and high in acid, with grating red cherry and red plum flavors. Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",68749
"71601","The body is nice and silky on this Zinfandel. It might be Grenache, it's so soft and delicate. But the wine is powerful in high alcohol-infused red currants and blackberries, veering into overripe raisins. Drink up.","Red","Zinfandel","US",71601
"96622","This is a serious, dark and brooding wine. Powerful tannins and dense structure along with layers of concentrated black fruits all point to a wine for long-term aging. The mineral texture and pronounced acidity add to the longevity of this impressive wine. Drink from 2019.","Red","Malbec","France",96622
"69389","Darker in color than many Provence rosés, this caramel-flavored wine has a fine line in ripe berry fruits to go with the smooth, velvet texture. Dry in style, its firm texture is right for food.","Rosé","Rosé","France",69389
"84281","The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",84281
"37687","A blend from Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard and the Bien Nacido Vineyard where his winery is located, this bottling shows candied red cherry, star anise, fennel and sagebrush on the earthy but fruity nose. The palate combines fresh thyme and other wild herbs with tart Montmorency cherry—bold flavors wrapped in a delicate package.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37687
"16473","Upfront, ripe pear fruit plays on nose and palate. These fruit notes are boosted by slight residual sweetness that makes this wine off dry, counterbalanced by a pleasantly bitter pith note. Enjoy this with ripe, runny cheese for a successful combination.","White","Pinot Gris","France",16473
"31563","This  dense, impenetrable Sangiovese has wild blueberry backed by a creamy, almost milky, structure. It is soft and lush with round tannins and lingering spice notes on the finale.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",31563
"65041","Forward cherry and plum aromas are fresh and lively. A blocky, full-bodied palate offers tasty plum and berry flavors in front of a firm finish with chocolaty notes and length. This is basic but done well.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",65041
"52348","Offers tropical, stony aromas in front of a crystalline palate that's citrusy as well as peachy, with lychee and melon flavors as well. Finishes springy and bright, with green citrus zest and nothing compromising. 60% Torrontés and 40% Chardonnay.","White","White Blend","Argentina",52348
"79362","Lemon-lime and lemon curd mark this wine. The lemon theme continues throughout the layers of apple, vanilla and oak, the oak not perceptible until near the round, voluptuous finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",79362
"90221","This wine's floral, lightly jammy red berry aromas smell like nice bath soap. It's tight and raw on the palate, expanding a bit with air. Its mix of red fruit and herbal flavors is linear and lively, although the finish is slightly abrasive.","Red","Mencía","Spain",90221
"88256","This is a ripe, lusty Zinfandel, with many special qualities to recommend it. It's dry and rich in smooth tannins, and offers a flood of wild forest berry, sweet new leather, red currant, mocha and exotic Asian spice flavors. Delicious, and will hold for up to six years.","Red","Zinfandel","US",88256
"92353","This southern Rhône blend is a good everyday one. With its slightly sweet, jammy berry, cherry, cocoa, herb and spice flavors, it's an easy partner with burgers and fries.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",92353
"22248","Packed with apples, peaches and raspberries, this light-bodied wine was aged in large oak casks and is quite fruity without being at all sweet. It has very good balance, is thirst-quenching but not filling, and will pair well with a range of seafood, salads and lighter main dishes.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",22248
"15851","Mature plum, scorched earth, grilled sage and a whiff of oak-driven spice aromas lead the nose. The soft, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry, vanilla, clove and a hint of game alongside rounded tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",15851
"65131","Made from a blend of 70% Fiano, 20% Moscato and 10% Malvasia, this offers aromas of tropical fruit and citrus. The subtle, simple palate presents peach, pineapple and pink grapefruit alongside fresh acidity.","White","White Blend","Italy",65131
"19123","Compost aromas and a clunky feeling palate get this off on the wrong foot. Flavors of burnt berry fruit and sweetness fail to impress. This shows hardly any snap on a cloying finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",19123
"19598","This wine is equal parts Walla Walla Valley Viognier and Yakima Valley Roussanne. Aromas of lees, almond and apricot are followed by elegantly styled flavors that linger.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",19598
"90879","This light and fruity wine offers fresh peach flavors, with a burst of lemon candy. It's off dry and finishes with a sugary kick.","White","Riesling","US",90879
"15902","Tannic and astringent at first taste, this wine opens up into a more complex and interesting play of dark fruits and darker flavors. Smoke, earth, char and espresso components are set against tight blueberry fruit, with lead pencil tannins. Those tannins might need a juicy steak to put them back in their cage.","Red","Syrah","Canada",15902
"98736","This vigorous blend of Grenache (60%), Cinsault (20%, Tibouren (10%) and Syrah (10%) has a good balance between rich fruits and the freshest acidity. While there is a crisp, tangy background, the foreground is ripe with strawberries and apricots. The whole thing is finished with a lively, bright aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",98736
"57588","Whether or not you consider yourself a fan of varietal Cabernet Franc, this is a wine to explore and to savor. Pure fruit is set amidst generous streaks of herb and earth, framed by firm tannins. The wine opens slowly, and pretty cherry flavors emerge, along with black olive, pencil lead and complex barrel notes.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",57588
"11561","This is a simultaneously fruity and savory wine of complexity and power from one of Victoria's underrated regions, Heathcote. From a mix of granite and the region's famed Cambrian red soils, this wine offers ripe blue and red fruit, florals and a peppery, olivey punch. The juicy fruit continues on the palate but here the savory elements play more of a starring role: Dried herbs and graphite are woven into fine-grained tannins and a long, almost tangy finish. Drink now–2027.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",11561
"94339","This is mouthfilling but not overly weighty, with a wonderful blend of herbs and spices rounded out by cherries and plums. Intense garrigue notes pick up hints of anise on the long, softly dusty finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",94339
"12228","A lean, austere wine with a mineral character over the berry fruit and acidity. That said, there is a warm layer of acidity and spice that is now coming to maturity in the firm structure.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",12228
"48578","The best of a lineup of single varietal red wines, this melds raspberry and cassis fruit flavors into a wrapping of earth and licorice. The dark and roasted accents continue through the finish with earthy tannins and a hint of stem.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",48578
"73571","This new release from a great vintage for Chardonnay in Champagne is a perfect blanc de blancs, showing a wealth of intensity from the crisp, chalky, mineral tones to the perfumed apple notes. The aromas hint at developing toastiness that adds depth and complexity. The wine is still young and it will age for years. Drink from 2020.","White","Chardonnay","France",73571
"69984","The spirit of South Africa's Swartland region shines through on this rustic but fun Shiraz. On the nose, red fruit and a spicy edge lead into big flavors of spice, smoke and fruit. Sturdy tannins give the wine an ageworthy appeal. Pair with grilled meat and heartier flavors for extra enjoyment.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",69984
"33031","The aromas draw you in with complex notes of chamomile, almond butter, herb and citrus. The palate shows depth and vibrant texture, exhibiting poise and exquisite balance. It delivers.","White","Chardonnay","US",33031
"81530","Rubbery and dark on the nose, with lots of black plum and cherry to ponder. The palate is firm and balanced, with round, rubbery, roasted plum and dark berry flavors. Full, nice and long enough on the finish to keep you involved.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",81530
"36828","A mouthfilling, off-dry Pinot Gris, Kim Crawford's 2007 continues his success with this variety. Pear and citrus notes finish clean, a refreshing blend of sugar and acid. Drink now.","White","Pinot Gris","New Zealand",36828
"58591","This is a fruity wine, full of both red-berry and cherry flavors and some dry tannins that will certainly soften and integrate. It has the potential to be balanced, full and deliciously fruity. Wait until 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",58591
"69852","A smooth, velvet textured wine. It has some weight, but the balance is what is most attractive about this wine. It has spice, crisp black currant fruits and intense freshness that tips over into final acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",69852
"76939","Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",76939
"15044","This straightforward, robust Rosso offers aromas of espresso, underbrush, and black berries. The warm, accessible palate delivers crushed black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and licorice. Enjoy now to capture freshness.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",15044
"13605","This shows real Sonoma Coast character in its silky texture, strong acidity and transparency of its raspberry and cherry notes, which allow for a mineral-driven taste of the soil to shine. The wine improves in the glass as it airs, picking up extra layers of complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",13605
"22036","Slightly leafy and damp on the nose, but dense. The palate is solid, with dark cherry and raspberry flavors along with herbal, drying notes and a touch of late bitterness. Spicy late, with coffee on the finish. Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Shiraz is the blend.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",22036
"89187","This salmon-colored wine made from Tempranillo is neutral in aromas, with a touch of creaminess on an otherwise standard palate. Mild peach flavors are slightly bitter. The wine loses freshness and focus the longer it sits.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",89187
"42275","Floral in jasmine and apple blossom, this wine offers a solid foundation of baked apple and sizable oak, still youthfully wound up in concentrated richness. Moderate acidity helps keep things in check, as lengthy complexity comes to bear on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",42275
"82045","The nose is sulphuric and a bit barnyardy, which screams“watch out,” but in the mouth there's acceptable if unspectacular apple fruit. It's scratchy in the finish, and probably just this side of not being worth drinking.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",82045
"22838","There's a touch of barnyard on the nose of this bottling, which also shows a soy and sweet black cherry scents. The palate is marked by beef char and cooked black fruit flavors, with a twist of funkiness, lending intrigue.","Red","Syrah","US",22838
"7445","Charred plums, roasted meat and a tinge of truffle oil lead the nose on this powerful yet balanced wine. It hits the palate with a sanguine iron flavor and a pleasant tension thanks to appropriate bitterness. This Pinot Noir can tackle the heartiest beef dish you can make.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7445
"53685","This is on the lean side, with tomato-leafy—almost ashy—notes that impart a dry, austere quality to the white grapefruit flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",53685
"102143","Blueberry, currant and smoky oak mark this wine, which provides additional highlights of black pepper and cedar. Generous in tannin and structure, this is the first vintage of this Karen Cakebread-made wine. It combines fruit from four vineyards across the valley, from Coombsville to Calistoga, including Shafer in Stags Leap. Drink now through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","US",102143
"27601","In much the same mold as its companion, the ghost in the machine Red, this is almost all Syrah, with a bit more bite and focus. Purple plum fruit glides smoothly into a lightly toasty finish. A fine every day red with plenty of flavor.","Red","Red Blend","US",27601
"89400","This is a new kitchen-sink offering from Banfi, featuring Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. It goes full bore on the red fruit and oak, with spicy berry aromas and cherry flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, and with ample acids, this young wine currently starches the cheeks. But in three years it should become a good to very good table wine.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",89400
"46700","Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet—in another three to four years.","Red","Malbec","France",46700
"58697","This Torrontés is a bit oily on the nose, with citrusy scents of orange and pineapple lurking in the background. In the mouth, it's a zinger, with sharp acids and a mix of tropical flavors and green apple. This finishes fresh and lean.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",58697
"46612","A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",46612
"21293","Le Ragose makes Classico and non-Classico Amarone. This is the non-Classico version with notes of toast, vanilla and raspberry fruit roll-up. It also shows nice aged qualities such as dark mineral, tar, resin and dried prune, making it ready to drink immediately. It has great length on the finish, firm tannins and bright acidity.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",21293
"67839","Delicate toast and cedar notes add warmth to ripe black cherry aromas on this squarely balanced Pinot Noir. On the palate, crisp red cherry and cranberry flavors are concentrated yet supple, framed with a fringe of finely textured tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",67839
"104337","This full-bodied, ripe wine  offers blackberry and spiced plum aromas on top of a minerally base. In the mouth, it's big but fresh and free-flowing. Flavors of black plum and black cherry are lively despite some creamy oak that rises on the finish. Drink through 2016.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",104337
"44184","Formerly known as Familia Schroeder, this Patagonian Malbec features racy acidity and a medium body. The nose is a bit stalky in smell, while oak, herbal shadings, mint and pepper support blackberry and cherry flavors through the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",44184
"1345","A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1345
"58877","This best-of-barrels reserve shows a richness and complexity that make for compelling drinking. A mixture of several clones and selections of Pinot Noir, the wine has firm tannins, but the burst of cherries, red currants, root beer and sweet smoky oak gives it a supple, mouth-filling quality. Delicious now with decanting, and should hold and improve through 2012.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58877
"55351","Whiffs of lemon and honey brighten notes of savory pressed apples on this tart, zesty Riesling. The palate is fruity with elegant tones of fresh peach and apricot, and finishes long with hints of lime and herb on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",55351
"97345","A truly succulent, opulent Chardonnay. Tastes quite oaky with char and butterscotch flavors, but not too oaky. The barrel regimen is precisely in keeping with the ripe tropical fruit and honeysuckle flower flavors. Feels rich and dramatic.","White","Chardonnay","US",97345
"44344","Ripe berry aromas are touched up with cola and root-beer notes that make this even nicer. A muscular, deeply structured palate is home to herbal plum and berry flavors along with notes of coffee and dark spices. Tobacco and herbal notes take over on a complex finish. Drink this Cabernet Franc (with 15% Malbec) through 2024.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Argentina",44344
"90027","Old vines, some dating from 1914, form the basis of this impressive wine. They give it concentration while the stone and sand soil brings even more richness. With its crisp acidity, lemon and grapefruit fruit, and creamy texture, the wine is refreshing and ready to drink.","White","Melon","France",90027
"34244","Creamy and fresh, this mineral-driven effort spent no time in barrel, and did not go through malolactic fermentation. The pear and apple fruit is quite clean and lightly minty.","White","Pinot Gris","US",34244
"50845","Firm, tense and dryly tannic, this is a solid wine, foursquare, its edges a little rough at present. The berry fruits are black, spicy from wood, creating a rich feel. In the end, black currant acidity and freshness finish the wine with a lift.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",50845
"66765","Wines like this are why Americans can't get enough Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Passion fruit and nectarine are joined by spicy hints of jalapeño, creating a fine balance of round, tropical fruit with peppery piquancy that leaves the mouth watering.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",66765
"8330","Here's a wonderfully fresh and tangy Chianti Classico (Sangiovese with a tiny element of Canaiolo) that opens with a bright, ruby appearance and tangy notes of wild berry, white almond and blue violet. The mouthfeel is fresh and focused.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",8330
"87432","Ripe, jammy orange, lime, apricot and mango fruit flavors join with buttered toast and vanilla flavors to make for an opulent, yet simple, Chardonnay. Brisk acidity provides balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",87432
"57164","Touches of cinnamon, turned earth, iron, dark cranberry and fresh raspberry hit the nose on this bottling from a celebrated vineyard. The palate shows lots of potential with more bottle age, offering notes of graphite, underripe berries, black pepper and bay leaf.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57164
"97152","This bright and well-balanced sparkler leads with attractive aromas of fresh lemon and orange slices, lightly toasted brioche and subtle fynbos herbs. The palate is creamy and smooth, with crisp acidity and medium carbonation that lifts and refreshes the finish. Delicious now, or hold through 2017 for a more mature character and additional depth.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",97152
"33888","A brooding Cabernet full of green and black olive, velvety cassis and cinnamon spice, this is ready to enjoy now. A juicy red, it has resolved tannins and a lingering taste of tobacco. Power and finesse are here, along with smoky minerality and savory fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",33888
"101417","This is a sleek and easy-to-appreciate Pinot Noir, on the lighter side, with fresh cherry and raspberry flavors, a touch of acidity for balance and a gentle texture. It seems polished and complete and not overdone.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101417
"77001","Soft and direct. Tastes like a liquid granola bar, with melted flavors of raspberries, cocoa, roasted almonds, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",77001
"90916","Whiffs of pine frond and moss lend a cool, alpine air to the nose of this medium-dry Riesling, but the palate is all lemon drops and sunshine. Juicy citrus flavor is uplifted by a stream of acidity that's invigoratingly fresh.","White","Riesling","Germany",90916
"36952","A careful wood regime has helped to shape dark and sophisticated aromas of leather and tobacco followed by brighter tones of cola and red cherry. The wine doesn't vaunt huge aromatic intensity, but it does delivers delicious length and persistency instead.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",36952
"43207","Raspberry is the lead aroma on an otherwise earthy, mossy and aggressive nose. Full bodied and rubbery, this has a blackberry flavor and an overriding baked character. Sweet and unwaivering on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",43207
"91710","There is a nice lift to the aromas, which focus on sweet black-cherry fruit. Streaks of cola and brown sugar come into play in the mouth, but the rich fruit is the star of the show.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91710
"39935","This is an impressive, solidly tannic wine that needs aging. The black plum flavors are still dominated by spice and wood, lending a dry and dark character to the wine. Solid with good depths of flavor, the wine should be kept for 4–5 years before opening.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",39935
"55413","Toast, coffee and French oak aromas lead the nose and carry over to the one-dimensional palate along with dried cherry and a hint of dill. Soaring alcohol throws it off balance. Give the raspy tannins another year or two to soften then drink before the fruit dries up completely.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",55413
"42571","This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",42571
"52480","A rich and inviting nose of berry-laced pastries, dried strawberries, stewed cherries and sagebrush kick off this layered bottling. The palate shows savory cracked black pepper along with strawberry, plum and black-raspberry fruit. A dry sagebrush quality gives complexity to the whole sip.","Red","Zinfandel","US",52480
"57652","Pretty golden hues set the tone and segue into floral aromas of acacia and honey. There are some soapy, Moscato-like qualities to this aromatic white and its floral fragrances transfer to the mouth where there's a smooth, creamy texture.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",57652
"21317","This French-Australian collaboration has turned out a soft, easy-to-drink Merlot with notable complexity. Cassis and black cherry fruit is backed by shadings of cedar and vanilla and eased along by a creamy texture and supple tannins. Without any track record, it's probably prudent to drink this over the next few years.","Red","Merlot","Australia",21317
"27560","Leafy gritty earthy berry aromas are spicy. This feels rugged but fresh, with a tolerable but strong tannic grip. Plum, boysenberry, chocolate, blackened toast and peppercorn flavors finish leafy, with firm tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",27560
"96746","This is a full-bodied, voluptuous and intense wine, with plenty of flair and complexity. A richness of berry pie is complemented by tangy acidity and layers of texture, finishing light and bright.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96746
"25319","A brand new product from the folks at Rotari, AlpeRegis is a fresh and vibrant sparkling wine that offers easy-drinking appeal with subtle hints of elegance and sophistication that set it apart. Baked bread, apricot and citrus notes flavor the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",25319
"31237","This Syrah shows the massively extracted flavors that mark Constant's Napa Valley Cabernets. Such an approach works for Cabernet, but on this Syrah, it seems clumsy. It's extraordinarily powerful in blackberry jam, milk chocolate and spice flavors, but it's a little heavy.","Red","Syrah","US",31237
"67625","Apple mash and salty oak are on offer in this light-styled estate wine sourced from several of the producer's single vineyards. Mellow in texture, it's intense on the finish, with a snap of anise and nutmeg.","White","Chardonnay","US",67625
"72264","Super-sweet, with an enormous blast of sugary blackberries, currants and espresso chocolate or Kahlua. Could use more flavor intensity for the sweetness level.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72264
"105769","Thick with dense black fruit and a smoky char aroma, this 100% varietal wine is burly and oaky. Broad-shouldered, it's one to pair with equally bold grilled meats.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",105769
"49932","From old vines, this powerful wine is the epitome of a great Douro red. Its ripe, plum and prune fruits, layered with bitter chocolate, are tinged with acidity. Spice and pepper add to the complexity of this ageworthy wine.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",49932
"41490","This is a punchy wine that's fresh on the nose. The palate sports a viscous feel that's related to Viognier and Chardonnay, while the Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris in the blend bring a citrus-like quality and an asparagus flavor.  The finish quickly loses steam.","White","White Blend","Chile",41490
"55116","Produced by the Château de Bligny close to Beaune, this soft, perfumed wine has stalky red fruits, laced with a dry core of tannin and fragrant acidity. It could age for another year.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",55116
"101487","This wine blends in Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah and Malbec, reining in the bold, tart red fruit to create a medium-bodied, softly textured palate with a leathery backbone. Clove notes are followed by a chocolate chaser on the lingering finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101487
"36959","A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",36959
"89979","A Cabernet Sauvignon-leaning Bordeaux-style blend, this has a healthy dash of Syrah (10%) added to the mix. It brings notes of jammy red fruit (cherry, raspberry) and herbs along with an assortment of barrel spice top notes, with tart flavors and somewhat unresolved tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",89979
"92501","Pungent, feline aromas of nettle and passion fruit are sharp and uric. This feels narrow and angular, with racy acidity. Flavors of passion fruit, grapefruit, bell pepper and cactus pad finish with pink-grapefruit sharpness and pithy bitterness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",92501
"8690","This wine has a hot-pink color, effusive strawberry and cherry aromas and then sweet fruit flavors that give a sugary impression on the palate. It's very simple in approach and low in alcohol.","Red","Zinfandel","US",8690
"88099","The honeyed aroma of this Rhône blend of Marsanne, Roussanne, Rolle and Viognier makes it immediately attractive, but then the flavors kick in, and it turns into a roller coaster ride. Apricot jam, peaches, pears, pineapples, butter-sautéed plaintain, vanilla custard, star anise, lemon crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. The finish is fully dry and the alcohol is refreshingly low. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",88099
"56041","Fresh, slender and easy—these are the virtues of this light wine that would be a great solution for a party.","White","Riesling","Austria",56041
"39905","Citrus, orchard blossoms and sea-spray aromas are lively and focused, with an almond-skin note lingering in the background. The juicy, racy, off-dry palate brings to mind talc-dusted red apple and quince, with a toasty, leesy finish.","White","Riesling","US",39905
"84249","This good, generic red wine smells like mixed fruits and tastes mildly fruity along with light veggie flavors. It feels lean in texture and dry in balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84249
"38953","Warm and ripe, this has yellow fruits that contrast with the freshness of crisp apples. There is a light touch of minerality, although the essence of the wine is its fruitiness.","White","Chardonnay","France",38953
"63160","This young, fruity wine from Vignobles Lesgourgues has great potential. Along with its bright red and blackberry fruits, it has succulent acidity and touches of wood aging that have smoothed the fruity character. It needs to age longer, so keep until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",63160
"105884","A blend of top sites Celilo and Conner Lee, this appealing wine displays aromas of candy corn, corn silk and chamomile. The stone-fruit flavors are elegantly styled, showing a sense of restraint and balance that carries through the lingering finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",105884
"56001","Peach, melon and mineral waft from the nose, followed by melon and grapefruit flavors. The finish is surprisingly tropical, a mix of bananas and coconut. Starts off better than it finishes, leading one to believe that if served quickly and chilled it will do well with seafood and appetizers.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",56001
"96672","Syrah makes up more than half of this blend that also includes Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Malbec. The combination is medium-bodied and mixed, with baked bread and tart cranberry competing for attention. Bay leaf and dried herb also play roles, before the whole finishes light.","Red","Red Blend","US",96672
"46794","A soft but spicy nose starts this flavorful sip from Thorntree. Open, fresh and friendly on the palate, the wine has a simple but elegant character. Pair with poultry, grilled seafood or enjoy every day on its own.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",46794
"98744","While still closed on the nose, this has hints of green and yellow pear that shine through. A slender but very appetizing juiciness on the palate is light but full of freshness and flavor. Yeast, aloe vera and herbal spice add even more pleasure. It's a gorgeous, refreshing wine from a challenging vintage.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",98744
"18116","Generous notes of ripe, juicy pear lead on nose and palate of this wine. An earthy, slightly bitter edge lends definition and texture but undereath it all lies the purity of fresh-cut Conference pear and lemon. This wine is bone-dry and lip-smackingly refreshing.","White","Pinot Gris","France",18116
"68167","From a Freestone-based vineyard, this wine offers an earthy funkiness on the nose, veering into forest floor, that then evolves into dark cherry and vanilla. A deep imprint of oak is felt on the palate, along with a tart rhubarb-like finish accented by a touch of black pepper.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68167
"90560","Aromas of plum, black currant and blackberry are heightened by dried cranberry, with hints of bell pepper and white pepper. Firm tannins on the palate are balanced by the acidity, with brambly flavors of blackberry and plenty of pepper. The tannins linger through the finish, with note of white pepper and bramble.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",90560
"1717","Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine.","Red","Grenache","US",1717
"37928","Although it's just a guess, it seems clear that Snoqualmie was the loser in 2004, when so many small wineries were helped out by Chateau Ste. Michelle, which provided them grapes during a bad freeze year. Snoqualmie probably should not have made a reserve under the circumstances, as this falls well short of recent efforts. It's a light and simple wine, with thin candy cherry flavors and herbal streaks.","Red","Merlot","US",37928
"54053","This clonal selection shows powerful aromas of cinnamon, mace, sandalwood and plump boysenberry on the attention-grabbing nose. There is a refreshing black-plum-skin tartness to the sip, which is decorated with potpourri, sagebrush, bay leaf and eucalyptus flavors. The mouthfeel is soft, yet zesty acidity and firm structure hold it all together.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54053
"48222","A little soft and heavy on the nose, which conveys a sense of overripeness. In the mouth, it's not overly heavy but it is sort of chunky as flavors of apple and citrus brush up against mealy but then draw back to a fresher place. Finishes mild, with only a modicum of acidity. Drink soon for best results.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",48222
"42181","Espresso, roasted coffee bean, plum and toasted oak aromas lead the nose. The dense palate doles out crushed dark cherry, espresso, mocha and roasted sage alongside youthfully aggressive and very astringent tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink 2020–2040.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",42181
"17813","This Barbera is soft, sweet and simple. It shows the rich tannins of the variety, but isn't ageworthy. Tastes like melted blackberry jam mixed with anise, black pepper and smoke.","Red","Barbera","US",17813
"81547","A pretty Sangiovese, gentle and easy to drink now. With crisp acidity, it has flavors of sour cherry candy, tobacco, red licorice and peppery spices.","Red","Sangiovese","US",81547
"8181","Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the Côte des Blancs. The wine is just ready, although it will age further.","White","Chardonnay","France",8181
"34880","Soft and rounded, this rich wine brings out the smoother side of Sauvignon Blanc. With its apple and pear flavors, it has ripeness that is cut by lime acidity. Drink this wine from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",34880
"29286","Blaufränkisch, also known as Lemberger, has found a happy home in the Finger Lakes, and this example from winemaker Nancy Irelan is striking. Tart Morello cherry is accented by cool swathes of fresh herbs and a touch of smoked nuts. It's concentrated and robust, yet elegantly composed. Soft tannins trace a moderately long finish.","Red","Blaufränkisch","US",29286
"93820","This is pure, superripe Sangiovese, and it bears fruit flavors of strawberry preserves and cherry pie, plus a dash of dark chocolate and accents of mint and vanilla. It's big and a bit blocky, but it's loaded with fruit.","Red","Sangiovese","US",93820
"96222","Aromas of charcuterie, smoke and grilled herb lead the nose. On the simple palate, a note of white pepper accents a red-berry core. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and soft tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",96222
"72683","An arresting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Merlot (27%) and Cabernet Franc, it displays purity with its herb, bay leaf, earth and cherry flavors. The exquisite balance is where this wine really shines, winning over on its elegance, detail and length rather than power. It shows first-class fruit and exceptional winemaking.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",72683
"95849","Fleshy pear and applesauce aromas are dusty but not substantive. The palate feels grabby and cidery, with lemony acidity. Odd flavors of stale passion fruit and grapefruit finish yeasty and broken.","White","Albariño","Spain",95849
"70758","A blend of Sangiovese and 10% Ciliegiolo, this wine has a fruit and spice aroma of crushed red berries, white pepper and clove with a whiff of coffee. The tightly woven palate delivers black cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, mocha and black pepper alongside assertive, tongue-drying tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",70758
"88824","Boysenberry, cracked rainbow peppercorns and dried rose petals show on the nose of this bottling, which plays to the lighter side of the grape. It's tart and brisk once sipped, with cranberry and pomegranate fruit given more complexity by a touch of wild fennel.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",88824
"18715","Nice aromas of cherry fruit and sweetness are perfectly clean, while the palate is slightly spunky and high in acid, with wild-berry flavors running side by side with red cherry and citrus. Has a tart, blazing side but also very good fruit character and purity","Red","Syrah","Chile",18715
"87621","Lots of sweet raspberry, cherry and sugar-coated doughnut flavors in this simple little Pinot. It has the virtues of silkiness and good acidity. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87621
"47951","This is the perfect wine for washing down pasta salad and easy dishes. Peach, citrus and pink grapefruit are delivered in measured doses and the wine is light and lean in the mouth with a brilliant sparkle of acidity on the close.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",47951
"86345","Solid, luscious and silky smooth, this white wine from the northern Friuli region is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Pinot Bianco grape you'll find. Stone fruit and nutty tones are rich and penetrating and backed by more fruit and white flowers. Half the wine sees four months of oak to shape its creamy consistency and heightened complexity.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",86345
"7319","Massara is a gorgeous, seriously beautiful expression of Barolo with dark concentration that follows straight up to the wine's rim. Opulent aromas are of forest fruit, cherry cola, licorice, mesquite shavings and root beer. The wine has all the qualities for a long aging future including acidity, tannins and pulpy fruit tones.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",7319
"102955","Fully mature, this flavorful, authentic-tasting Shiraz features scents of toast, molasses and vanilla, followed up by flavors of tobacco and cassis on the palate. It's a bit coarsely textured, but assertive and would pair well with roast beef or lamb.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",102955
"353","Tender notes of red apple skin and bottled strawberries are pulled into focus by zesty citrus. The bone-dry palate reveals more bottled but wonderfully tart strawberry flavors and finishes in a very linear, refreshing and light-footed fashion.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",353
"11469","Named after the river that flows through the Dão region, this wine is powerful, concentrated and serious. Still young and full of tannins, it also has ripe black fruits and balancing acidity. The structure brings out the granite soil of the region, with its dark, brooding quality. This is a fine wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",11469
"27267","With 11.1% residual sugar, this is a sweet wine, but it's also a little simple. That brown sugar and honey sweetness is delicious, by definition, but the underlying flavors are a little disappointing.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",27267
"85198","Bryan Babcock heads to Bentrock Vineyard on the southwestern edge of the appellation to deliver this wine redolent of red cherry, plum, mulberry, peppery spice and sagebrush. The palate is rich and full bodied, with tangy red plum skin and eucalyptus touches, finishing on a fresh, menthol-like note.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85198
"23554","Smashed black rocks and turned earth meet with black plum and pasilla chile on the nose of this bottling. The palate is relatively thin in body but full of blueberry and pepper-spice flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",23554
"20369","A touch of honeyed richness plays into the pear fruit evident on the nose. The palate has the same honeyed touch, countered by pleasantly bitter pith. This is ripe, full-fruited and warm, fresh and zesty at the same time. The finish is lasting and dry.","White","Pinot Gris","France",20369
"77447","A dense, wood-aged wine, it brings richness, intense fruit and acidity together. It's complex and concentrated, powerfully structured and full of yellow fruits as well as lemon juice, edged with toast. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2018.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",77447
"31219","This fine new offering is whimsically packaged with a screw cap and a floral label. That spirit is further evidenced by the wine's pretty pink color and subdued, light building of flavor, highlighted by orange, peach and strawberry notes and a substantial bite of mouthwatering acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31219
"23979","There is a delicious, citrusy kick to this wine, lifting the bright berry fruit flavors. The flavors pile on, with peppery spice and chocolate, and a complex midpalate that tastes like cherry cola.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",23979
"50110","This 50-50 blend of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon is jammy and modest on the bouquet. In the mouth, it's plump but a bit wishy-washy, with generic dark-berry flavors. While it's easygoing on the finish, it falls off a bit and doesn't show much kick. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",50110
"71313","Made from 60% Nero d'Avola, 30% Alicante and 10% Nocera, this offers tobacco, violet and black cherry aromas. The savory palate delivers mature blackberry, carob and black pepper flavors alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy through 2021.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",71313
"23120","Malbec from Chile may not seem as natural as from Argentina, but you will not go wrong with this stocky, soft, lightly baked offering. The palate has a touch of herbal lift to accent the black fruit, while the finish is firm, comfortable and consistent.","Red","Malbec","Chile",23120
"87906","This red blend has ripe tannins and a dusty core of leather that frame rich red fruit on the palate. A partnership between singer Dave Matthews and winemaker Steve Reeder of Simi Winery in Healdsburg, it's fairly priced and accessible, with moderate alcohol and a soft, medium-weight body. It contains mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","Red","Red Blend","US",87906
"6552","From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Sumeire family, Coussin's second wine is tangy, textured and with lively acidity. The texture is as important as the fruit, giving a mineral edge to the acidity. The red fruits finish with an attractive lift.","Rosé","Rosé","France",6552
"94913","Here's a full-bodied, deeply-flavored young Pinot that combines flamboyance with elegance, a very difficult feat for any wine. There's an exoticness to the fruits, spices and smoky, sweet oak. They all meld together into some impossibly decadent pastry, and yet the finish is firm and dry. Should evolve through 2012, at least.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94913
"12911","Lusciously textured and bursting with citrusy acidity, this combines savory tones of burnt sugar and apple cider with hints of fresh orange peel and white flower. Crushed stone and a tea leaf astringency linger on the finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",12911
"86614","he bouquet smells jammy and not that exciting. In the mouth, freshness takes over, but the acidity is hard. Flavors of wild berry are spicy and continue into the finish, with oak making itself known.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",86614
"29155","Blended with 5% Sémillon, this crisp, tropical white is generous with bright acidity and a strong taste of pineapple and lemon. Zippy minerality adds a stoniness to the texture and flavor, as a fresh-cut grass note lingers in the background.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",29155
"32471","Red berry, baking spice and grilled herb aromas lead the nose. The taut palate doles out succulent black cherry, raspberry, licorice and a mint note alongside firm but polished tannins. Give this time to open up and unwind. Drink 2017–2024.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",32471
"78577","Rounded, earthy notes of ripe fruit are foremost in the aromatic stakes. On the palate they are joined by a yeastily textured savoriness and fresh citrus verve. This goes well beyond mere fruit and shows off the more earthy side of Grüner. Satisfyingly zesty finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",78577
"94639","Luscious grapefruit and lychee juxtapose earthier notes of saffron and fennel that extend from nose to finish. It's a dry, full-bodied Gewürztraminer with sunny acidity lending freshness to the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",94639
"80629","Named for nickel's number on the periodic table, this hillside vineyard site is located across Lake Hennessey on the eastern edge of the valley. Entirely varietal, it offers juicy layers highlighted in cedar, mountain sage and mellowed chocolate. The oak and tannin are well integrated and deeply embedded, providing support and structure.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80629
"11275","Still very young, this is an off-dry wine with bright acidity. The wine is not in balance with the sweetness clashing with the fruit. It could come together in a year, but that is somewhat doubtful.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",11275
"414","Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance. Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances.","Red","Grenache","US",414
"99434","This premier cru is on the cooler left bank of the Serein river, making this vintage a crisply mineral wine that's tight with zesty lemon and fine crisp acidity. The hints of yellow fruits are still to develop. The wine is structured and needs to age, so drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",99434
"8184","Just beginning to mature, this balanced, ripe wine is complex, with bright acidity, toast and pear and green-plum fruits. It is rich, with a tight mouse that shows intensity as well as a stylish character. This is a fine wine just coming into its own but well worth aging further until 2020.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",8184
"19759","As is normal for Embruix, the nose is generous and jammy, with extracted flavors of grapy black fruits and earth. The palate is smooth and jammy, with easy tannins and ripe flavors of plum and cassis. The finish is loamy, plump and soft. Drink through 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",19759
"24626","What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",24626
"24237","This wine has plenty of honeyed sweetness. The apricot, orange and vanilla flavors are just delicious. Crisp acidity provides the perfect zesty balance.","White","Moscato","US",24237
"44004","Earthy, meaty and spicy-it's what Napa Cabernet is supposed to be. Perfectly balanced, smooth and totally correct, it has cherry and chocolate in spades and lots of grip. In the end it's all about class and performance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44004
"23098","Kana's Workingman's Red has turned into a southern Rhône style blend of six grapes, the only outlier being a splash of Tempranillo. Toasty, round and easy-drinking, it's a good, all-purpose barbecue red, with a smoky, espresso-scented finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",23098
"40290","Tropical fruit and melon aromas are basic but friendly. This has a punch-like mouthfeel as well as open-knit flavors of orange, nectarine, white grapefruit and apple. What it lacks in finesse is made up for in fruit.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",40290
"8299","Grown in red ironstone soil, this wine is dark and firm. It has solid tannins as well as succulent black fruits. Combined, the two give the wine its rich dense character. It's a ripe wine, likely to age for another few years. Drink from 2018.","Red","Malbec","France",8299
"71222","Snappy and pure aromas grace the nose, with Bartlett pear, lees and toasty oak most prominent. The palate is overt and fruity, featuring apple and citrus flavors accented by bright acidity. This seems like a fine appetizer, by-the-glass, or party-friendly wine, but the composite cork the winery is using is madness to get off the corkscrew. Best Buy.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",71222
"10683","Might this be the best wine Marqués de Cáceres has produced? The vintage is one of Spain's greatest, and gran reserva is supposed to be Rioja in its loftiest form. So indulge in this beauty's rock-solid structure, lovely violet and raspberry aromas, and long, stout finish. Best from 2012–2018.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",10683
"84868","Elegant and aromatic, this 2013 offers light flavors of apple and raspberry, a dusting of cocoa and excellent balance. It does feel a bit thin as it fades out, but keeps its definition and focus.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84868
"87043","Red cherry and raspberry aromas lead the bouquet, with secondary notes of red currant and savory herb in the backround. This is medium weight, with dusty but gripping tannins and a firm structure.","Red","Tempranillo","Israel",87043
"95586","Blackberry, black currant and toasty oak make for a dark, charred, manly nose. This is full but not heavy, with racy acidity and firm tannins. Blackberry, baked plum and savory flavors finish with notes of prune and leather as well as salted cured meat. Drink through 2022.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",95586
"93195","This blend of 91% Syrah and 9% Grenache delivers a load of wild herbs and forest undergrowth to the savory nose, giving depth to the cassis and vanilla aromas. That garrigue character is wrapped around the mulberry and boysenberry core of the palate, where touches of smoke and roasted pork complete the sip.","Red","Syrah","US",93195
"53829","At first blush, this comes across scratchy and raw on the nose. In the mouth, it's more jammy than lively, with saturated, reduced flavors of blueberry and prune. On the finish, this feels big for its britches and tastes mildly bitter.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",53829
"47046","Surprisingly, this Red Mountain Merlot is rather light and tart, showing cranberry fruit with a streak of smoke. The tannins are peppery and earthy, with a hint of stem; a European style, with poise and good balance.","Red","Merlot","US",47046
"46211","This 100% varietal wine from the producer's prized estate vineyard is soft textured and full bodied—an exploration of leather, blackberry pie, coffee and cigar. With its long, black pepper-inflected finish, it's ready for steak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",46211
"57710","Plum and pomegranate play off each other in this monument to Howell Mountain, the wine dense and Rubenesque, suggesting further time in cellar, through 2022. With 1% Cabernet Franc blended in, the tannins and oak are well-integrated, spiking in tobacco and licorice.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",57710
"68886","A gorgeous and well-balanced Chard that's on par with some of the more popular offerings from other notable regions. Elegant and expressive with butter, toasted brioche, red apple skins and almond paste unfolding in the bouquet while flavors of baked apples and pear lead through to the marzipan-infused finish. Full and intense but not fat or overdone; drink now with stuffed lobster or thermidor.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",68886
"94438","This Rioja reserva hits all the standard checkpoints with aplomb. Earthy loamy mossy aromas of plum and berry fruits feature a hint of tobacco and vanilla. In the mouth, this is full, with round but serious tannins. Tea, wild herb, black plum and berry flavors finish with savory soupy notes and prodding tannins. Drink through 2022.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",94438
"82337","Fully mature, this calls to mind an inexpensive village Burgundy: one that is just a touch past its prime. Delicate secondary fruit flavors and firm acidity are in place, with residual hints of tomato leaf and flesh.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",82337
"57807","Made with 75% Merlot with the rest Cabernet Franc, this wine commands attention with aromas of dried and fresh herbs, black fruit, toast and flowers. The dark fruit flavors are rich, layered and tightly coiled, captivating attention with spot-on balance.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",57807
"32575","A soft, fleshy wine to drink now. It has a fancy mouthfeel, with a firm hit of tannins and acidity, and lush flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and spices.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",32575
"27297","Sharp and gritty in the mouth, with cutting acidity. Despite nice cherry, spice and sandalwood flavors, the texture is too peppery tart.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27297
"85034","Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. There's a hint of pastry crust in the finish, which is seamless and long. An absolute delight.","Red","Merlot","US",85034
"104138","What a bargain in a fine Chardonnay. There is a hint of vanilla, flavors of pears, apples and melons and a rich mouthfeel, perfectly balanced by ample acidity. Should be easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced. From Delicato.","White","Chardonnay","US",104138
"90643","This comes from one of Josh Jensen's vineyards that got barely a half-ton an acre this vintage. It offers aromas of sandalwood, leather, dried strawberry and sagebrush and is light and airy on the palate, with medium red fruits, roots and bark complexity on the midpalate. The wine finishes on nuances of hibiscus and black tea.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90643
"78508","This is a serious, wood-aged wine whose ripe fruits are dominated at the moment by heavy toast flavors. The fruit does offer weight and good potential, making it a structured, dark wine that is beginning to suggest a juicy future. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",78508
"32393","In 2011, the fifth vintage of this Riesling, the alcohol is down a bit, as is the price. It remains quintessentially fruity, done in a tangy/tart sweet and sour style. Juicy apple, kiwi, peach and pear flavors fill the mouth in a most satisfying style, perfect for front porch sipping.","White","Riesling","US",32393
"90402","The entry-level wine from Sacha Lichine's Château d'Esclans. It is soft, broad, with more caramel and spice than fruit. It is definitely a food, not an apéritif, wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",90402
"20110","Crisp and refreshing for a Gewürz, a variety that can often get overblown. Peppery floral scents mingle with green apples, moving smoothly into pineapple, peach and pear fruit flavors. Minty-fresh greens emerge to play a leading role on the long, clean finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","New Zealand",20110
"86115","Cortinie Bianco opens with impressive intensity and lasting aromas of peach cobbler, vanilla cream and preserved peaches. It follows with a smooth, dense texture in the mouth.","White","White Blend","Italy",86115
"47774","The apricot notes of Viognier come through strongly with this smooth, ripe wine. It has a steely character and a cool freshness from the Arinto and Síria in the blend. All in all, an attractive wine that could age a few months.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",47774
"31849","Honeysuckle, citrus blossom and white stone fruit aromas take center stage. On the rounded palate, fresh acidity brightens beeswax, white peach and Bartlett pear. A bitter almond note wraps up the finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",31849
"41435","A reedy and odd-smelling wine. No matter how many times you come back to it, there's the scent of latex and a strange perfume to the nose. In the mouth, it's tannic and blocky, with saturated black cherry and a funky, unfamiliar twist. And it finishes with rubber, plastic, cotton candy and coconut notes. Can't say this does much to push Carmenère's status.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",41435
"86312","This is a classic, concentrated but elegant wine, from the wonderful black cherry and forest underbrush aromas to the ripe fruit flavors, full body and polished texture. Aging in 30% new Hungarian barrels gave a subtle spicy accent.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86312
"93471","Small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah are blended within this sanguine wine, which features tight-grained tannin and a grittiness to the texture. Black cherry, black pepper and a taste of soy round out the flavor profile.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93471
"63201","Yeasty, bready aromas reflect time in the bottle, although for a gran reserva this is still young. Depth and cushion are present on a slightly foamy palate, while this wine is less about ripe fruit flavors and more about sourdough and fermented citrus notes prior to a lasting finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",63201
"75671","A sweet smell like raisins and very ripe, grapy flavors ride a soft, broad texture and medium body. It's not too dry and it's not at all tannic. It's easy and gentle to drink.","Red","Zinfandel","US",75671
"95632","Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with subdued aromas of ripe plum and vanilla. The aromas carry through to the robust palate, together with tobacco and clove. Round tannins provide soft support. Drink through 2019.","Red","Merlot","Italy",95632
"71269","Very ripe and forward in fruit, this Cabernet floods the mouth with cherry fruit flavors, liberally enhanced with the sweet vanilla and toast of oak barrel aging. The tannins are strong but finely ground. Appeals now for sheer beauty.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71269
"9443","Robert Brittan oversees this project. This first release is a cuvée assembled from a selection of barrels he had vinted at the Carlton Winemakers Studio. Silky and dappled with details of underbrush, bramble, black cherry, cassis, smoke and clean earth, this is a lovely blend with elegance to spare. The low alcohol in no way means this is a thin or shallow wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9443
"84060","This is an open and fruity wine, made to be drunk young. With its wood-derived spice notes, black currant fruitiness and acidity, it's balanced, elegant and ready to drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",84060
"23544","This is a single-vineyard wine from Pfaffenheim. Giving a touch of spice as well as delicate acidity, it's light, bright and fruity. Crisp right through and attractively perfumed, it is ready to drink now.","White","Riesling","France",23544
"63478","With 14% Malbec and Syrah thrown in, this Carmenère is fresh, tightly wound and balanced. It starts with controlled herbal-vegetal aromas along with cherry, raspberry and tarragon. The palate has olive and spice to accent deep black fruit, and the finish is a little oaky but not what you'd call overdone or drying. Full-bodied and textbook for the variety and appellation.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",63478
"9713","A thread of dusty mushroom underlies some pretty raspberry and cream notes in this full-bodied Shiraz, adding an astringent note to the finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",9713
"6146","Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",6146
"45621","Smoke and leather tack-room scents and flavors, making for a sharp, short, fruitless wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45621
"3211","With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",3211
"50395","Sweet, grapy, raspberry-candy fruit flavors are set against suggestions of dried leaf. Tannins are grainy, with a rough, earthy finish.","Red","Sangiovese","US",50395
"16178","Enticing aromas of rose, iris, berry and leather lift out of the glass. The firm, elegantly structured palate offers black cherry, star anise, clove and white pepper alongside youthfully assertive but refined tannins. Drink 2018–2023.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",16178
"88408","This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",88408
"47759","Mushroom, tobacco, leather and red berry aromas lead the nose. The palate is still closed, revealing game, barnyard and bitter, green tannins but not a lot of fruit.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",47759
"32016","Notes of ripe Russet pear dominate nose and palate. The fresh body gives full rein to these ample lively fruit flavors. Zesty tangy freshness counters the full fruit and creates a lively, harmonious, moreish and refreshing wine. The finish is dry.","White","Pinot Gris","France",32016
"36654","This Garnacha-Carignan blend contains some Syrah as well and smells almost exclusively of clove and spice. On the palate, it's resiny and sticky, with overwrought clove and barrel spice flavors that dominate the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",36654
"67026","Very fruity, with jammy or pie-filling flavors of red cherries, raspberries, cola and sweet cedar, sprinkled with cinnamon, anise and melted butter. The tannic structure is rich and refined, suggesting moderate ageability.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",67026
"96996","All the Lemelson Pinots in 2014 are strikingly similar—rather light, tart, clean and simple. Cranberry and raspberry fruit, bright and tangy, tells the whole story here. Drink it over the next few years while that freshness remains.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96996
"18508","This is a well-made blend of Syrah and Grenache. On the palate, rich cherry flavor is accented with hints of mocha, prosciutto and rose petal. It finishes dry despite the ripe fruitiness with a streak of tart acidity.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",18508
"80393","This is a pleasant, rather light-tasting wine with attractive, fresh raspberry aromas, red cherry flavors and good acidity to balance out the ripe fruitiness.","Red","Red Blend","US",80393
"48941","Sweet and powerful in toasted oak and ripe fruit, this Chardonnay brims with pineapple jam, lemon custard, buttered toast, caramel corn and vanilla bean flavors, in a creamy texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",48941
"69532","Grape-jam aromas and ripe, sweet flavors make this wine attractive in its easygoing, accessible style. For a deep, dark red, it has a surprisingly soft, velvety texture and a mild amount of sugar.","Red","Red Blend","US",69532
"30317","Benton-Lane makes quite a lot of Pinot Gris, stainless-steel fermented and whole cluster pressed, yielding a soft, fragrant, fruity wine with plenty of fresh pear flavor. It flattens out broadly across the palate, full-bodied and lightly spicy. Just a bit more focus would really elevate this wine to the top ranks.","White","Pinot Gris","US",30317
"81202","Juicy, fruity wine, all red berries and freshness. The wine feels warm, just right for a hot dish on a cold day. The acidty gives some shape without losing the ripeness.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",81202
"64546","Dusty aromas of cocoa, herbs and spice grace prune and plum scents. This is firm, layered and healthy in mouthfeel. Flavors of baked plum, blackberry and mocha finish dry and well balanced. This has more than a few years left in it. Drink through 2023.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",64546
"25950","Fragrant with scents of citrus rind, this brings a dense core of lemon, lime and grapefruit, just bordering hints of peach. It's quite dry, very fruity and substantial. It was sourced entirely from the DuBrul vineyard.","White","Riesling","US",25950
"70895","This vibrant wine offers floral and fruity aromas of iris and just-crushed black grapes laced with spice. The palate is both structured and fresh, with black cherry, white pepper and cinnamon flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",70895
"39499","Smooth and velvety, with chocolate-cherry flavors, but the sweetness tails off quickly, disappointing the palate. Good and sound, but lacks the continuing richness you want in a true Port-style wine, especially at this price.","Port","Port","US",39499
"91619","This wine offers black cherry, chocolate and lavender aromas. It has a good mouthfeel, with blackberry, pomegranate, juniper and violet flavors set in a web of supple tannins that give way to dried Mediterranean herb notes on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Israel",91619
"62212","Made for Oops by VIA Wines, this oddball Chardonnay features 14% white Carmenère, meaning there's red fruit (without the skins) added to the blend to give bulk and texture. The result is a slightly waxy, sticky white with peach pit aromas followed by basic apple and citrus flavors. You don't taste any red fruit, but you do know that it's not 100% varietal Chardonnay. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",62212
"81264","A spicy, perfume-shop aroma leads to a wine that is all about spice and some sweetness. Soft, round and rich, this wine could do with some aging to bring it fully into balance with the acidity. Drink from 2016.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",81264
"72027","Floral currant and plum aromas fall squarely into the red-fruit spectrum. While not overly deep or dense, this has some weight to go with flavors of cassis, berry and chocolaty oak. It finishes mildly, with soft oak and a light herbal note.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",72027
"89684","You expected fruity, flowery flavors? A little sweetness? Then go someplace else. This wine is one of the driest of the year, and offers no relief at all from alcohol and other winey compounds. If there's a single, solitary flavor, it's watered down lemon juice. But it might be pretty good with clams on the half shell. —S.H.","White","Riesling","Australia",89684
"11738","Norm Yost is considered the sparkling pioneer of Santa Barbara County, and his bubblies continue to excel. This exhibits fresh lemon and lime zest notes, with wet cement, peach blossom and sourdough yeast on the nose. There is a grippy tension to the palate, where lemon, green apple and biscuity flavors intermingle.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",11738
"65790","This low-alcohol Basque rosé starts off funky. Pickled, peppery, herbaceous aromas lead to a tart, acidic palate that's not unusual for this style of wine. Sour, herbal, peppery flavors repeat in lighter form on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",65790
"53449","While initially a bit smoky, or even slightly sulfurous on the nose, time and air restore prettier notes of berry and cherry to this zesty dry rosé. Sprightly and crisp, it offers a refreshingly breezy finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",53449
"62587","Forest floor, resin, exotic spice, steeped plum and a balsamic note lead the way on this robust red. The firmly structured palate offers raisin, dried cherry, licorice and coffee framed in tightly wound, close-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",62587
"65698","Briny, bready aromas of apple cider set up a smooth but slightly soft palate. Flavors of nectarine and green herbs finish short and briny, like an echo of the nose. Drink now.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",65698
"94247","A seriously top of the heap California Syrah. This complex, interesting wine sings of black pepper and garrigue, fleshy in just-ripe cherry, leather and dark plum. From the mountainous Fenaughty Vineyard, always a good source, it finishes long and will age gorgeously if you can possibly wait to drink it; that pepper will mellow in interesting ways.","Red","Syrah","US",94247
"101816","A gorgeous wine, the best Big River that Ravenswood has ever produced. Has everything you want in a Zinfandel. It displays rich, peppery blackberry and currant fruit, splendid tannins, crisp acidity, fine dryness and a long, impressive finish. The high alcohol is not out of place.","Red","Zinfandel","US",101816
"58690","This riserva delivers savory aromas of cured meat, leather and rum cake followed by fresh berry tones of cherry and wild blackberry. The complexity is excellent and the wine finishes with bright acidity and fine tannins.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",58690
"65207","Dry and tannic, this has deep blackberry-pie and spice flavors. A touch of unripeness, suggesting green peppercorns, detracts from the pleasure. Drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",65207
"72602","This straightforward Barolo opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of black cherry, violet and underbrush. The bright palate offers up dark red cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside firm tannins and brisk acidity. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",72602
"93851","Made from Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet, this is an old-style wine, easy to drink with everyday fare. It's soft and sweet and fruity.","Red","Red Blend","US",93851
"84703","Concentrated, bright and focused fruit flavors feel shaped by a moderate oak influence in this full-bodied and nicely structured wine. A good amount of tannin wraps the raspberry and blackberry flavors in a firm texture.","Red","Zinfandel","US",84703
"57950","Jammy aromas are accented by hints of mint, animal hide and cinnamon. This feels wide, grabby and low in acidity. Rubbery flavors of baked plum, chocolate and baking spices finish flat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",57950
"19279","Ripe, heady, slightly malty aromas of blackberry and plum set this on its way. In the mouth, there are scratchy, unresolved tannins and acidity to deal with along with salty flavors of oak, plum and cassis. A lasting, oaky finish with vanilla and butter notes provides for a good close out. Drink through 2020.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",19279
"85063","Sauvignon Blanc and wood don't always go together. Here they do, because the fruit is still dominant, just supported by the hints of toast that have smoothed out the tense acidity and herbal character. Yellow fruits and pears are lifted with citrus flavors. The wine will be ready to drink starting from mid-2016.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Portugal",85063
"53663","The tannins of this refined yet full-bodied Cabernet come across as sinfully silky in texture, giving the wine a sense of softness while still providing structure. Smoke, maple syrup and cassis notes gracefully intertwine on the nose and palate, then end on a long, cedar-laced finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",53663
"11964","An enormously elegant, complex Pinot Noir that changes endlessly in the glass and is a joy to drink. Completely dry, and marked by silky tannins, it shows complicated cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, orange tea and sandalwood flavors. First class. Best now and for the next four or five years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",11964
"47808","This smells like toasted bread and hickory smoke and tastes even more charred and smoky. Like a good barbecue sauce it has a sweet touch to balance the smoky, jammy fruit flavors. This is an extreme taste experience that will be a big hit with some.","Red","Zinfandel","US",47808
"102762","Light aromas, light body and delicate peach and apple flavors make this slightly sweet wine simple and refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",102762
"21110","This simple Chardonnay is tropical fruit driven, with a floral aroma and a twang of resiny oak. The palate seems slightly disjointed in feel, briny in flavor and citric on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",21110
"4295","Silky carpets of cherry grenadine invite one into this vineyard-designate, framed by seductive streaks of herbes de Provence and earthy black tea. Juicy and generous on the palate, the wine is also complex and restrained, its finish wrapped in toasty, subtle oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4295
"36997","While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish. Delicious now but worthy of cellar time as well.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",36997
"99906","Loud, briny raspberry aromas are not shy and come with a note of latex. This is wide and blocky in feel, with heavy, baked flavors of raspberry and stewed plum. Oak spice and mild peppery bitterness on the finish are ponderous.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",99906
"16240","The oak on this basic Cab offers a nose that is pasty and lactic, while the palate and finish are resiny. In between, there are rubbery tannins, berry fruit flavors and a lot of vanilla and carob.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",16240
"44698","This delivers a delicately fragrant bouquet of white flower, stone fruit and lemon zest backed by a spicy touch of cracked white pepper. Pair this bright sparkler with smoked salmon on toast.","White","Glera","Italy",44698
"43125","Mouthfilling and round, without any sharp edges, but this wine remains extremely firm and dense, with several decades of life ahead of it. Dried fig, chocolate and black licorice flavors only hint at what lies ahead.","Port","Port","Portugal",43125
"5797","From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",5797
"76206","This cool climate Roussanne shows more of a steely side of the grape, rather than ripe, round and fleshy. Citrus skin and peach pit flavors combine with a slight suggestion of chalk and mineral.","White","Roussanne","US",76206
"76954","This is sharply herbal, with peppery bitter greens framing tart berry fruit. It's 100% Pommard from 20-year-old vines, but in this chancy vintage the fruit flavors did not get quite fully ripe.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76954
"30926","Tight and packed with acidity, this is a very fruity wine dominated by herbaceous Sauvignon flavors that need to soften. It seems one-dimensional, just herbaceous and citrus.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",30926
"21780","The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",21780
"24904","Black pepper, smoke, grilled bread and other robust flavors come to mind when sipping this big, distinctive and well-made wine. While ripe and full bodied, it's not overly fruity or jammy, and retains a sense of reserve and strength along with a very firm backbone of tannin. Best to drink after 2020.","Red","Tannat","US",24904
"13465","Punchy, grassy aromas of citrus and tropical fruits capture most of what's good about coastal Chilean SB. This feels angular, fresh and minerally, with flavors of tangerine, lime, lemon and grapefruit. A tangy, lasting finish is pure Leyda.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",13465
"94491","Richly soft, round and concentrated, this wine is exuberant in apple flavor, with a touch of stone fruit and papaya. It has a pleasing succulence that should broadly appeal.","White","Chardonnay","US",94491
"32619","This wine reflects the ripeness of the vintage while still retaining crisp minerality. Creamed apples are balanced with a tangy texture and soft acidity. The wine finishes with a crisp aftertaste that gives a great lift. Drink the wine now.","White","Chardonnay","France",32619
"11823","Immediately this Malbec is defined by loud, toasty, overbearing oak. On the nose, it smells like vanilla, sawdust, campfire and creamy but generic black fruits. In the mouth, it's blocky, while heavy oak-influenced flavors of chocolaty mint and vanilla finish like an ice cream sundae.","Red","Malbec","Chile",11823
"66095","Siduri has a good track record with this vineyard. The ‘07 is not a longterm ager, but if you're looking for a complex Russian River Pinot for now and through 2011, this will please. Dry and silky and complex, it has fully ripened cherry, currant, cola, rose petal and spice flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66095
"49036","A rich, mellow whiff of vanilla and burnt sugar sweeps across the nose at first before appetizing tart notes of Granny Smith apple kick in. The palate is superfresh with these same green apple notes but also has a toasty mellowness adding and earthy charm and a richer, pithy texture. The finish is rounded but dry and lasting.","White","Riesling","France",49036
"47938","This shows real varietal character with spicy peaches-and-cream flavors and a nice vein of smoky oak, and a honeyed, crisp finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",47938
"64119","This wine dazzles with detailed aromas of black currant, plum, herbs, cassis and earth along with barrel accents. The palate is wound up tightly at present but still accessible with layered, seamless fruit flavors along with a lengthy finish. It will be best enjoyed from 2022–2030.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",64119
"70359","A lovely wine, unique and distinctive. Has the rich creaminess and citrus and tropical fruit flavors of an upscale Chardonnay, but with a nutty, exotic sweetness, like roasted cashews. Very fine, soft and opulent wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",70359
"96065","Opens with heavy aromas of earth, compost and baked fruit. The palate has a corresponding heaviness and sweet, roasted, buttery black-fruit flavors. Sticky and oaky on the finish, with lasting sweetness and some bitterness. Chunky and clunky, but not a bad wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",96065
"7879","A smoky perfume marks this young wine immediately as Cabernet Franc. Its ripe blackberry and juicy black currant flavors give it richness, while tannins come through strongly. It's a powerful, solid wine, with great potential. Drink from 2020.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",7879
"12925","From an estate site, this wine offers power and concentration. Creamy in texture, the generosity of fruit is balanced by notes of stone, toasted oak and French butter, making for a wonderfully complete experience on the palate.","White","Chardonnay","US",12925
"104765","From a warm vineyard, it has super-ripe aromas of baked cherry pie, with smoky vanilla. Made in a rustic style, with berry flavors and soft acidity.","Red","Syrah","US",104765
"3","Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.","White","Riesling","US",3
"32467","This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices.","Red","Zinfandel","US",32467
"98085","Crisp raspberries and red currants here, with a refreshing, lively acidity. If there is any intensity in this finely balanced wine, it is in the relationship between the fruit and the clean structure. But this is not for aging—drink now.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",98085
"69309","Vibrant and refreshing, this easygoing red offers aromas and flavors of ripe raspberry, crushed black cherry, ground black pepper, smoke and star anise. Bright acidity and supple tannins lift the savory flavors and give it a silky texture.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",69309
"23446","Citrus and green-herb aromas are as they should be for Verdejo. A chunky, slightly oily mouthfeel and pithy, salty flavors of citrus and stone fruits finish round in feel and briny in taste.","White","Verdejo","Spain",23446
"102105","A rich, bacony, black fruit monster with deep, molten flavors and immense body and tannic grab. A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop. Young, tannic and wild now; best from 2011 through 2015.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",102105
"73212","Blackberry paste, crushed black rocks and a pinch of baking spice show on the nose of this bottling, which is a project between sommelier Paolo Barbieri and his partner Erin Kempe. The flavors are full of dark red and candied purple fruits, with clove, olive and vanilla touches and a dense tannic structure.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",73212
"96483","Fresh but full with ripe flavors of kiwi and Key lime citrus accented by savory herbs on the palate. Balanced, with bracing acidity and a lingering finish accented by notes of white peach. A nice choice for poached halibut. 300 cases imported.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",96483
"94764","Creamy and fresh, this off-dry sparkler offers heady aromas of exotic fruit, candied orange peel and ripe peach. The foaming palate doles out ripe apple, Bartlett pear and crystallized ginger alongside crisp acidity that gives it an almost linear quality.","White","Glera","Italy",94764
"100539","A beautifully structured wine, with its tannins layered between the ripest black plums, damsons and black currants. It is opulent while remaining dense, concentrated and very serious. Certainly a wine for long-term aging.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",100539
"29443","This medium-weight Shiraz features subtle campfire notes from start to finish, underscoring its cherry and mint aromas and flavors. Fresh and friendly, it features a soft dusting of tannins on the finish. Drink it now and over the next few years.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",29443
"79089","Ripe and very dry, this has flavors of raisins, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a hint of smoky oak that adds richness.","Red","Merlot","US",79089
"38163","Focused aromas of blackberry, elderberry and black currant show on the nose of this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc, which also offers hints of leather, nettle and caramel on the nose. It's lively on the palate, with black raspberry, rose petals and violets, framed by a vibrant acidity and worthy structure.","Red","Red Blend","US",38163
"46815","With strong wood-aging flavors, this is a full, very ripe and concentrated wine. Coming from old vines, it has depth of flavor, both fruity and rich. Peach and pear flavors dominate, along with spice from wood aging. The wine needs some aging, so drink from 2015.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",46815
"93876","This is a soft, muddled and somewhat green wine, with sizable tannins and an earthy element of wet tobacco that will require strongly flavored food to enjoy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93876
"21324","This label has turned a corner from its early days; the 2005 is a very nice wine with smooth, ripe berry aromas backed by black cherry, smoked meat, coffee and other savory, dark flavors. Structured and well put together, with medium-depth flavors and good balance.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",21324
"99879","Fruit salad aromas, simple apple and pear flavors and a soft texture add up to a pleasant wine. Light bodied, and balanced away from crispness, it is still enjoyable and refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",99879
"11901","This wine is rich while also crisp. Refreshing red fruits are laced with a touch of orange peel and spice. A blend of the local Nieullucciu and Sciaccarellu, it is fruity and very ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",11901
"4335","A fine companion to the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a smooth mix of plums, black cherries, tobacco and spice. It's knitted together beautifully, with highlights of cinnamon.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Canada",4335
"28253","Pointed and herbal on the nose, with olive and a hardness that suggests paint or chemical. The palate is tight, grating and tastes of jumbled fruit and olive. Herbal and minty on the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",28253
"62400","Now eight years old, this Pinot Noir shines. Its aromas range from concentrated plum, earthy beet and rhubarb to balsamic vinegar and mint chip ice cream. The palate offers candied raspberry fruit, still fresh, with juniper and black tea accents that keeps one coming back for more.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",62400
"101982","Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression.","White","Chardonnay","US",101982
"96292","Unfined, unfiltered and fermented with native yeasts, this is a solid effort with medium concentration that expands with ample aeration. Blackberry and black-cherry fruit is matched to notes of cola and chocolate, with fresh acidity and a pleasing, textural mouthfeel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96292
"45655","Supple and rich, this medium-bodied wine is slightly sweet, blending berry and cherry flavors with milk-chocolate accents. The sweetness softens the texture and makes it feel broad and mouth-filling.","Red","Red Blend","US",45655
"55910","Underbrush, mint, graphite, leather, mocha and tobacco are just some of the aromas of this full-bodied red. The palate offers dried black cherry, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside mature, buffed tannins. This is at its ideal drinking window so enjoy over the next few years.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",55910
"9343","Dry tannins from the old wood give this wine a hard edge at first. Fresh, juicy red fruits offer an enticing character. On the finish, the tannins are tough and will need several years to soften","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",9343
"70969","An abundance of fresh fruit spills out of this full-bodied, pure and uncomplicated wine in a way that's hard to resist. There is little obvious oak to get in the way of flavors like vine-ripened raspberries and blackberries as they stream along on fine tannins and lithe acidity.","Red","Zinfandel","US",70969
"33637","Everything tastes interventionist on this Chardonnay. The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness. Will satisfy fans of the New World style, but the wine, tasty as it is, lacks authenticity and balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",33637
"46220","Whiffs of gooseberry and tart green plums lend a zesty, green tone to this refreshingly mineral off-dry Riesling. It's a concentrated but spry wine, full of fresh lemon and lime flavors glazed by hints of wax and stony minerality. The finish is persistent, edged by a hint of bitter citrus peel.","White","Riesling","Germany",46220
"70559","Luscious and thick, this is precisely the kind of Pinot Grigio you'll want to pair with salmon, white meat, asparagus or leafy spinach and ricotta ravioli. It has structure and penetration and ends with a swirl of passion fruit, pineapple and yellow rose.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",70559
"103924","While exuberantly fruity, almost tropical on the nose, there's a crystalline edge to this dry Riesling that renders it especially refreshing. It's vibrant and light footed, brightened by a lingering honey note on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",103924
"42619","This shows lots of Chardonnay charm and lusciousness. The texture is creamy and buttery, the flavors are suggestive of ripe pineapples and oranges, plus layers of vanilla and butterscotch are just right.","White","Chardonnay","US",42619
"26988","From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.","White","Riesling","US",26988
"40139","Crushed flower, wet earth and ripe berry aromas waft out of the glass. The palate offers black cherry, black pepper and espresso alongside soft tannins. It's straightforward and made to be enjoyed young. Drink through 2015.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",40139
"21724","Lush and ripe, made in the modern California cult style of flamboyantly sweet blackberries, cassis and chocolate, soft tannins and immediate appeal. Defines richness and opulence, if not complexity. Drink now–2014.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21724
"15262","Rustic, rubbery, leathery aromas are highly suggestive of animal hide and stalky berry fruits. This is hard as rocks on the palate, with an astringent mouthfeel. Briny, leathery berry and plum flavors end with a stalky aftertaste.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",15262
"54202","There is a great burst of appealing acidity in this wine, accompanied by refreshing red fruits. This balanced wine is lively, crisp and with plenty of flavor. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",54202
"17953","The prestige cuvée from La Gordonne is full and rich, packed with raspberry and red plum fruit. As a balance, there is a taut, crisper side to the wine, leaving a bright lemon zest aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",17953
"89200","This is a crisp, fresh wine with red-currant fruits and light tannins from the Alliance Bourg co-op. It is juicy and fruity, likely to develop quickly to give a light, bright wine.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",89200
"34267","Very dark, rich and dramatic. Massively constructed, with vast reserves of blackberry jam, blackstrap molasses, mocha, smoked meat, mushu plum sauce and sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are big, ripe and astringent. A great Cabernet that clearly needs plenty of time. Drink 2015 and beyond.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",34267
"33494","Pure citrus aromas give this wine an immediate and attractive lift. It is supremely fresh, light and airy, its freshness highlighted by the lightly toasty wood. The texture gives more density, showing rich apple skins and pear spice, followed by a finish that again shows great acidity.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",33494
"13667","Briary and powerful smelling, with leathery aromas of blackberry and dark plum, this heavily extracted Malbec is grabby and tannic. Earthy, roasted blackberry and leathery flavors end with simmering heat. This is a big, fruity and gripping Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",13667
"32009","A woody jammy nose is lush and borders on raisiny. Stout, saturated and thick on the palate, this Cabernet blend from Curicó deals a broad swipe of giant blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors. A chunky finish with rubbery tannins is tasty and lush, but a bit over the top.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",32009
"20570","Good acidity in this Chardonnay provides a brisk balance to the ripe pineapple, passion fruit, pear and spice flavors. Made in the modern style, it has a minerality that lifts it and provides interest.","White","Chardonnay","US",20570
"29469","The relatively cool Adelaide Hills are making a name for their Sauvignon Blanc, and this example shows a restrained, grassy bouquet and flavors of grapefruit and tangerine. It's plump on the midpalate, then almost razor-sharp on the finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",29469
"26853","Forest floor, black plum, menthol and a whiff of exotic spice unfold on this elegantly structured wine. The precise palate offers mature black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and hint of chewing tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",26853
"10926","Hot, salty popcorn, pan-fried apples and melting butter show the oak but in a judicious manner. Flavors of lemon are layered over poached apples, all presented with a mouth-enlivening acidity, and culminating with a touch of vanilla bean on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",10926
"7615","Light and earthy, this wine glows in spicy citrus, with a rhubarb-and-strawberry tartness and black tea accents. Medium-bodied, it shows an underlying crispness that belies its weight and depth, the oak subtle yet supportive.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7615
"18375","Herbaceous, with notes of fresh leaves, green florals and honeydew, this bargain eiswein is ethereally delicate on the palate. It's honeyed in sweetness, but briskly composed, with sharp lemon acidity.","White","Riesling","Germany",18375
"28011","Here's a rich, flashy Chardonnay. It has a fat, butter-and-cream mouthfeel, with waves of pineapple tart, lemon meringue, buttered toast and honey flavors that finish soft and lush.","White","Chardonnay","US",28011
"104186","Broad and ripe on the nose, with sappy blackberry, plum and youthful aromas. The palate is big, full and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors in front of a smoky, hickory-driven finish. Chewy, blowsy and generous for $10 Tempranillo.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",104186
"75479","Ripe botrytis, honey and peaches make for an attractive, open, ready-to-drink sweet wine. The acidity keeps the richness in check.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",75479
"24831","Pure Cabernet, ageworthy wine. Right now it is quite tight, somewhat herbal and compact. The fruit is layered, a range from strawberry through cherry and into cassis, and it leads sharply into spicy tannins with a clear edge. This cellarworthy wine will need considerable breathing time; or pop it in the cellar for up to a decade.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",24831
"96091","Chocolate, mocha and espresso mark this big, bold and full-bodied wine that includes a touch of Petit Verdot in the mix. Smoky and smooth, it's ready for cigars or hearty winter platters.","Red","Malbec","US",96091
"15898","This is a nice Bordeaux-style blend with pretty cherry and currant fruit and some cedar shadings, but lack the complexity of others in its style. It's straight forward, polite and restrained.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Australia",15898
"86930","A little off in texture, with a grainy mouthfeel that's part tart acids and part edgy tannins. However, it's lusty in forward cherry and raspberry fruit flavors, and will surely satisfy many Pinotphiles.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86930
"59605","This has brisk, tingly acidity and rich, toasty new oak flavors, plus mineral and fruit notes. Try this in 2015 as it could become surprisingly complex.","White","Chardonnay","US",59605
"18593","Smells of vegetable oil and farm-fresh sweet corn still in the husk, but the flavors are more like what you expect from a Riesling: green apples and underripe Asian pears. The finish is a bit metallic, but otherwise features fresh lime zest.","White","Riesling","New Zealand",18593
"3096","With a vineyard planted in the traditional Beaujolais style of individual bushes rather than trained on wires, this is a light, soft and fruity wine. It has attractive tannins and fresh red fruits. Drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",3096
"39900","This ripe, bold wine is rich in black fruits. They cushion the naturally prominent tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional that form part of the blend. It is a solid effort, juicy and ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",39900
"14359","From vineyards at 2000 feet elevation, this is a rich and spicy wine that has a pure streak of fruit freshness and a firmly tannic core. It is perfumed from Touriga Nacional in the blend, with red berry and black plum flavors coming through strongly along, balanced by acidity. It will be better from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",14359
"9074","This blend of Merlot and Cabernet has aromas of bell pepper, black currant and a hint of cedar wood. The palate shows one-dimensional flavors of plum, black currant and oak.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",9074
"90159","Cabernet Sauvignon (38%), Syrah (35%), Merlot (22%) and Sangiovese comprise this blend of declassified barrels. It displays aromas of mocha, barrel spices, dark berries and cranberry. The black-fruit flavors are ripe and generous, backed up by a firm lick of tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",90159
"76735","The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of fruit leather, medicine cabinet and green herbs. The palate brings more of the same, seeming more advanced than its age might indicate.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",76735
"55493","A plush, lush, value-priced Merlot, this is herbal and rich in truffle mushroom, fierce black-cherry fruit and oak. The generous finish suggests a measured helping of spice.","Red","Merlot","US",55493
"105724","This is a flavorful full-bodied wine from a cool growing region that keeps a tangy balance to support the generous apple, white peach and mineral flavors. It offers more depth and concentration than most versions and will be enjoyable to drink before or during a meal.","White","Pinot Gris","US",105724
"86172","This 100% Grenache cuvée displays charming and complex aromas of garrigue and ripe cherries and raspberries. It's lush and creamy in texture despite being vinified and aged in concrete. It's a touch warm on the finish, but delicious nonetheless. Drink now–2020.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",86172
"77926","There's a full-bodied character to this wine evidenced most by its sizable tannin presence and thick concentration. In the end it becomes quite approachable, spicy and savory in black pepper, currant and leather.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77926
"95833","There's a closed-off and slightly bitter edge to this wine, a blend of 35% Petit Verdot, 25% Malbec, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. A weedy, herbal streak is most prominent throughout.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",95833
"37461","An everyday Chardonay, this is seemingly sweet and fruity, with pineapple, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",37461
"14375","Quite fruity and fairly rich, this medium-bodied wine has plenty of apple, lime and dried herb flavors, and a fairly crisp but smooth texture. More than just a thirst-quencher, it brings some heft to the table.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",14375
"33254","This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",33254
"81391","The producer stays true to its roots with this deliciously made white, a blend of mostly Sauvignon Blanc with some Sauvignon Gris and Sauvignon Musqué. Waxy apple comes first, followed by fully etched acidity that manifests itself as fresh-cut lemon and tangerine. A 100% stainless-steel wine, it finishes refreshingly.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",81391
"45508","Opens with classic lychee and melon aromas and only a touch of flower blossom. The palate has a nice, clean, healthy feel and flavors of green apple, lime and melon. Exceedingly clean and easygoing, with juicy acidity and proper balance.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",45508
"57677","Thick and sultry smelling, with aromas of menthol, mint, tobacco, leather and ripe black fruits. Feels good but oaky, with resiny tannins and baked berry and vanilla flavors. Dark, toasty and mellow on the finish. Shows ripeness, balance and lots of oak. Drink now through 2014.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",57677
"94080","This simple wine offers subdued charred earth and dark-skinned berry aromas. On the palate, an unusual medicinal note and green hint of sage accent the faint sour cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent yet fleeting.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",94080
"96229","Craig has struggled to move this Paso Robles Syrah off-center and into the end zone for years. The fight continues. The wine is just too soft and simple in structure, although it does show pretty pepper-sprinkled black and blue berries and stone fruits.","Red","Syrah","US",96229
"9962","Light, subtle pink color echoes this wine's subdued nature on the palate, which reveals whispers of orange peel, strawberry and rose as it opens.","Rosé","Rosé","US",9962
"91188","Palate offers sweet but simple yellow fruit flavors, particularly peach and banana. Finishes with peach pit and caramel flavors. What's here is fine, but better concentration would have merited it a better score.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",91188
"63332","A vivid yellow-gold color grabs the attention and creamy, tropical fruit flavors deliver the goods in this medium-bodied but full-blown wine. Pineapple, grapefruit, fig and almond are layered in an almost unctuous texture, but supported by vibrant acidity that keeps everything in great balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",63332
"87470","Condensed up front, with aromas of berry compote and molasses. So why is this so tangy and tart in the mouth? Maybe the grapes weren't as ripe as they seem from the nose, and in the end it fails the all-important balance/wholesomeness test.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",87470
"74980","Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",74980
"75192","Plump blackberry, dark strawberry, dried herbs and baking spice show on the nose of this well-rounded and easily likable bottling. The palate mixes fleshy red and purple fruit with a strong chaparral component in the midpalate. The firm grippy texture makes this a more serious Zinfandel than most.","Red","Zinfandel","US",75192
"98274","Warm and hearty, this opens with aromas that recall mature dark-skinned fruit, leather, truffle, scorched soil and a menthol note. The big, chewy palate delivers black cherry marinated in spirits, ground pepper and anise alongside a tannic backbone. The heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and gives it a monolithic quality.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",98274
"57270","With soft tannins and fresh fruits, this light, crisp wine has a red fruit-flavored character that is intense in its acidity. Drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",57270
"72643","Blackberry and black cherry sauce aromas are given intrigue with tobacco leaf and sharp clove spice on this wine from a vineyard between the Santa Lucia Highlands and the Carmel Valley. Cinnamon stick and allspice shine on the very spicy palate, which is laid across a boysenberry backbone, with flecks of black pepper throughout.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72643
"60852","Remember when all Châteauneufs were priced like this? Now this is entry-level pricing, yet the wine is very good, delivering a complex, harmonious blend of leather, earth, spice and plum notes. It's soft enough to drink now and over the next few years.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",60852
"84333","Beeswax, light yellow melon, yellow peach and a touch of peach custard show on the nose of this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Picpoul Blanc and Viognier. Lime zest and yellow pear dominate the palate, which is light, fresh, intriguingly textured and full of acidic sizzle.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",84333
"42788","Made of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and redcurrant aromas. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black cherry and underbrush notes with a fine layer of smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",42788
"76326","Rusty in color but deep and complex in nature, this varietal Tannat dessert wine is jammy-smelling but tight and piercing on the nose. A thick, chewy palate is braced by good acidity, while flavors of licorice, kirsch, blackberry and burnt caramel finish long and intense, with additional notes of chocolate and raisin.","Red","Tannat","Uruguay",76326
"78197","Steve Dooley has championed this region since 1994, and this appellation blend is another strong argument. Aromas of sour tangerines, tangy pear, sea salt and hints of quinine are leveled by the slightest touch of brown sugar on the nose. The palate is dusted lightly with vanilla and offers ripe cherimoya and pear-custard flavors, bound together by steely, crisp minerality.","White","Chardonnay","US",78197
"76746","This takes the color rosé to an extreme. Almost white, with only the palest hint of color, it comes from 80-year-old Grenache vines. That creates what little concentration this light and delicate wine has. There is an attractive spicy herbal character that lies at the back of this fruity wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",76746
"35956","This blend of Chardonnay (72%) and Pinot Nero (28%) opens with aromas that recall white spring flower and a hint of sage. The palate offers easy drinking appeal with yellow peach, mature apple and toasted walnut flavors alongside bright acidity.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",35956
"106315","Beautiful touches of oak and lemon butter meet with sea salt and tangerine pith on the nose of this appellation blend by Bibiana González Rave. The balanced acidity of the palate presents fresh lemon-lime flavors, with a touch of Meyer lemon pith, and is wrapped in a chalky texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",106315
"33163","Tight and firm, this wine's herbal character and black currant fruit bring out the dry character of the wine and intense acidity on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",33163
"70149","Aromas of black plum, coffee and baking spice lead the nose on this hearty red. The ripe accessible palate displays prune, tobacco and vanilla framed in chewy assertive tannins. Drink through 2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",70149
"50966","Smells great and flashy, with inviting notes of blackberries, black currants, green olives and spicy sandalwood. Candied and sweet in the mouth, with blackberry and black cherry fruit. Tasted in March, 2011, the wine could well have been going through an awkward period. Should re-emerge by Fall and age well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",50966
"52075","Baked plum, baking spice coconut and vanilla aromas lead the nose. The evolved, fleeting palate offers raisin, nut and a hint of clove. Drink now.","Red","Barbera","Italy",52075
"78914","This warm style of Sauvignon Blanc has apricot and citrus flavors. Packed with fruit and with refreshing acidity, it makes a fine apéritif.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",78914
"106466","A rounded wine, benefiting from the fruitiness of the year to give soft tannins, ripe strawberry fruits and an attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although could age a few months.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",106466
"37787","Char and savory spices accent blackberry and cherry aromas on this crisp, medium-bodied wine. On the palate, delicate fruit flavors are a bit overwhelmed amidst layers of oak and spice. It ends with a soft kiss of tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37787
"57056","Fresh and fruit forward, this is a fine value in a most enjoyable style. Bananas, pears, apples and more are in play, with a mouthfilling, generous midpalate.","White","Chardonnay","US",57056
"100940","A vineyard-designate for the producer since 1975, the fruit shows well in this wine, an exotic tribute to tropical elements and stone fruit like peach, supported by a medium-weighted amount of vanilla oak. The ripeness of the fruit is complemented by endnotes of minerality and herbs.","White","Chardonnay","US",100940
"92269","This 900-foot-high vineyard produces wines that are flinty, mineral and tight. With its textured character and zesty lemon notes, this wine is fresh yet still developing. Plenty of fruitiness will explode in the next few months. Drink after 2016.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",92269
"86757","Potent, inky aromas of blackberry and licorice reflect this beefy Malbec's opaque black color. In the mouth, this is energetic and not just heavy and extracted. Lightly salted black-fruit flavors are lifted by acidity, while this finishes deep and strong. Drink through 2022.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",86757
"65024","This opens with herbal aromas of menthol, rosemary, sage and black pepper that frame the red berry and cherry core. The palate boasts ample acidity and medium tannins which, coupled with the ripe fruit flavors, result in a crushed-velvet texture. Clean and enjoyable now.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",65024
"79976","Blackberry, rubber, leather and spice aromas roll out on a good bouquet. In the mouth, this blend of 80% Monastrell with Syrah and Garnacha is ripe, smooth and full in feel, with chocolaty flavors of blackberry, espresso and peppery spice. Finishing notes of coffee and blackened toast are right for the wine.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",79976
"66942","Incredibly rich and sweet with honey, apricot and orange flavors, this intense dessert wine is balanced with citrusy acidity. It's super-delicious, long and gooey sweet on the finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",66942
"47325","Cabernet-philes who want to experiment with Petite Sirah will find this a rewarding entry wine. It shows the variety's firm, punchy tannins, full-bodied muscularity, and deeply extracted black currant, plum, carob, coffee, pepper and cedar flavors that are powerful and long-lasting. Yet beyond the brawn is elegance and finesse. Drink now through 2010.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",47325
"60399","This wine has a dark red color, bold, smoky, tobacco-like aromas, full body, generous blackberry and dark plum flavors, firm tannins and a dry impression overall. It seems to improve and show more depth with each sip. Drink now through 2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60399
"52690","Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot delivers succulent black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper, grilled herb and mocha flavors alongside firm but velvety tannins. It's well balanced with surprisingly fresh acidity for the hot vintage. It's already drinking well but will be even better after 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",52690
"38664","This is a highly unusual blend of Marsellan and Touriga Nacional, and it smells reduced, lemony and like cola and coffee. The mouthfeel is grating, with sandpaper tannins. Odd, herbal, citrusy notes infiltrate core blueberry flavors, while the finish is hard as nails and tannic to an extreme. Only 200 cases made.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",38664
"84640","Aromas of blue flower, dark berry, scorched earth and a whiff of oak spices come together in the glass. The palate offers dried cherry, game, ground pepper, toast and espresso alongside grippy, drying tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",84640
"30643","Smooth, polished and ripe, this is a blend of Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Those are both warm appellations, and in this warm vintage, the wine is extremely ripe. It brims with chocolate, cassis and licorice flavors. Almost too fruity, this is saved by a dry finish.","Red","Merlot","US",30643
"68860","A spicy aroma of ginger cookies meets dark, blackberry flavors on the palate of this medium-bodied, pure-tasting wine. The gushing fruit flavors are compelling and palate-cleansing, with light tannins and acidity keep it fresh and lively.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",68860
"50761","A bit of serious minerality has been coaxed out of the frequently frivolous Gewürztraminer in this fairly crisp example. The medium finish shows appealing notes of fresh grapes. Drink up.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",50761
"2323","Here's an earthy expression of Sangiovese that opens with aromas of truffle, forest floor, ripe plum and a whiff of barnyard. The rustic appeal carries over to the palate, which offers ripe blackberry, ground pepper, bitter sage and a gamey note. Assertive tannins provide backup but leave an astringent finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",2323
"5023","This wine is tight and mineral textured. Still young, taut and nervy, orange zest flavors are blended with apple and grapefruit acidity. There is a juicy concentration that develops in the glass and will become more dominant as the wine ages. Drink from 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",5023
"76722","Earth, leather and tarry berry aromas yield to a fresh, forceful palate with power and balance. Spicy plum and berry flavors are a touch herbal and pointed, while a peppery, woody, spicy finish is leathery, hot and scratchy. Drink through 2018.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",76722
"105398","You'll find it difficult to keep your hands off this gem, a block selection from the estate vineyard. The name, notes the winery, comes from an ancient Greek dance. Dark, smoky and toasty, this gripping wine is tight-knit and packed with raspberry and black cherry fruit, set against sweet baking spices. The balance is perfect, and this will drink well now through 2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105398
"60584","A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",60584
"79680","This salmon-colored wine is powdery on the nose, with aromatic hints of apple skins and raspberry. The palate feels lean, pinched and rubbery, while flavors of pithy citrus fruits finish chalky, with some tang.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",79680
"49716","This is an attractive, fruity wine that has soft tannins and ripe fruit. Berry flavors and a full-bodied fruitiness are right up front, while the aftertaste has crisp acidity. Drink Now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",49716
"37295","Shows the grace and beauty that characterize this fine vineyard, and also the integrity of the vintage. Firm tannins and tart acidity frame ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola and sandalwood. Excellent, but needs time. Best mid-2010 through 2013.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37295
"12773","This wine that Doug Margerum makes from the Los Alamos Valley vineyard owned by Dan and Meghan Reeves presents intriguing complexity on the nose, from violet and rose petals to smashed boysenberry, thyme, rosemary and roasted boar meat. Blueberry, blackberry and black cherry soak the palate, which is evened out by pine sap, cedar, purple flowers and shiitake mushroom-powered umami.","Red","Syrah","US",12773
"92533","Light notes of forest berry, cassis and licorice root unfold on the nose and on the medium-weight palate. This might not be the most complex wine, but it's clean, balanced and approachable now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",92533
"66270","Redhawk makes an interesting lineup of value-oriented Pinots, this one just a cut above their popular Grateful Red. Medium bodied, it carries fruit flavors of raspberry and plum, with a hint of dark chocolate from aging 13 months in 20% new oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66270
"89022","Dry and balsamic on the bouquet, with earthy, mellow berry aromas that do not push. In the mouth, it comes across charred and roasted, with baked, chocolaty, leafy accents on top of core red fruit flavors. Turns more leafy and charred as it unfolds, with a forward finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",89022
"88515","Light, airy aromas of tropical fruits and kaffir lime are modest. In the mouth, the wine is tight and chalky. Flavors of lime, lychee and green apple finish firm, with nice acidity and a slight oily character.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",88515
"87031","Made to be drunk young, this surprisingly soft Malbec is ripe and full of smooth fruit. Juicy red berries come strongly through the light tannins that are accompanied by acidity and a fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.","Red","Malbec","France",87031
"33551","Appealing aromas of berry and pepper spice lead this likeable Merlot from Romania. Integrated but somewhat simple, the wine nontheless has an overall elegant character and tannins with enough chew to temper aging. An interesting choice from an emerging (to the U.S.) wine region.","Red","Merlot","Romania",33551
"85869","Intensely spicy and rich on the nose with notes of cinnamon, dark plum and black cherry, this Zin has an aromatic intensity that fades somewhat on the palate. It's structured and textured with dusty tannins and finishes with a touch of prune.","Red","Zinfandel","US",85869
"8019","A big, ripe wine that is full of tannins as well as rich black plum fruit flavors. It is dark with bitter chocolate, smoky bacon flavors as well as a concentrated structure that promises aging. This 100% Touriga Nacional is still so young, still tough, so drink from 2018.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",8019
"93657","This balanced, ripe and fruity wine is already refreshing and crisp. Plenty of red-currant flavors go along with the lively acidity and bright aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",93657
"23356","The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",23356
"51534","Purple to the eye, with intense aromas of mint, licorice and saturated black fruit. The mouth is like blueberry-blackberry compote, while the oak seems heavy given the wine's higher acids and limited depth. Has plenty of positives but sings just one note.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",51534
"20195","Concentrated hibiscus and rose petals are cut by an iron minerality and anise character on the nose of this wine that Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton make for a Japanese partner. It's rich on the palate but still just medium weight, showing graphite, Asian spices, black peppercorns and lots of textural energy and acidic verve on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20195
"91259","This full-bodied wine brings a basket full of fruit to the table. It smells like grape juice and black cherries, and tastes plummy, almost jammy but not sweet. The tannins and acidity are lighter than usual, making it easy to enjoy.","Red","Tempranillo","US",91259
"24297","Pert and juicy in feel, overripe lemon and peach tones mark the nose and palate. This is enjoyable but not overly engaging or long lasting on the palate.","White","Riesling","US",24297
"38840","Past vintages of Moccagatta's Basarin Barbaresco have been stellar, but this bottling still needs time to find its feet. The fruit is youthful and raw; the tannins are tight and astringent. Give this wine 8–10 years to evolve.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",38840
"61516","Blackberry jam aromas are followed by fleshy and full dark-fruit flavors, surrounded by a layer of fine grained tannins. It provides a lot of quality and value.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",61516
"22858","Fans of stickies may find pleasure in this bottling, but it is tremendously sweet and oily. Candied honeydew and kiwi scents meet with sweet juniper and pine on the nose. On the palate, it tastes squarely of golden honey. It's soft, unctuous and thick in consistency.","White","Moscato","US",22858
"63002","This is intensely ripe and almost tropical, with yellow fruit and flower notes that are balanced with layers of smoke, wet stone and brisk, steely acidity. This is a dry yet lavishly textured wine, with flavors that meander long on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",63002
"21976","A prime example of why Pinot Noir is great to release later in its life, this six-year-old wine is signing with concentrated strawberry, iron, dried rose petals, stewed black cherry and raw beef. The palate is quite earthy but also packs black plum, vanilla, pepper, thyme and marjoram into a wondrous and complete package.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21976
"15183","Well-rounded pear and apple aromas get a fresh squeeze of lemon in this good-deal Sauv Blanc. It's easy to drink, with apple popover flavors (whose toasty elements come from the 20% barrel fermentation) and a brisk acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",15183
"78835","Any winemaker will tell you how difficult it is to make Pinot Noir in large volumes, so this is a notable achievement. Delicate herb and cherry aromas pick up vanilla shadings on the palate, then finish with a silky texture and a hint of tomato leaf. 10,000 cases imported.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",78835
"15971","Adelaida's basic Paso Cab is delicious and charming, a wine to enjoy with grilled meats or even a simple roast chicken. Direct in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, it finishes a little sweet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15971
"19857","Made from 70% Sangiovese and other red grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a little rustic and wild. The palate is rich, full and offers plenty to chew on. Bold plum and black cherry flavors dominate. A nice woody accent graces the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",19857
"7118","Lots of rich, savory Pinot flavors in this silky wine. It's kind of generic, and not showing much sense of terroir, but it is a properly grown coastal wine whose brisk acidity highlights cola, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7118
"103253","Rich plum, earth and spice aromas are followed by lush black cherry, blackberry, cassis, herb, coffee, chocolate and raspberry flavors. An intriguing floral edge runs through the core for added interest, all supported by firm, ripe tannins and fine body. The finish is long and smooth, with just a hint of brightness on the end. Made from 100 percent Cabernet Sauvignon. A first release from the folks who also make Harlan.","Red","Red Blend","US",103253
"3933","This forward Brunello opens with a fruit and spice fragrance of ripe black berries, cinnamon and hot red pepper. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry, ripe black raspberry, black pepper and cake spices alongside dusty tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",3933
"3406","Deep and concentrated, this full-bodied wine has a noticeably dark color, big aromatics like cedar, black cherries and tobacco, and mouthfilling flavors that combine savory, peppery elements with very ripe fruit. It is rich enough to coat the mouth and linger on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",3406
"29781","A bit spicier than the other R Wines Shirazes, the 2007 Boarding Pass features mainly McLaren Vale fruit, offering blackberry tinged with coffee and peppery spice. Turns tart, tangy, almost a bit citrusy on the finish.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",29781
"14740","Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging.","White","Chardonnay","US",14740
"55560","Sweetly extracted fruit and oak star in this rich Pinot Noir. It has flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pop tart, vanilla, buttered toast, brown sugar and cinnamon. All this richness is balanced by brisk, mouthwatering acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55560
"63260","Scents of freshly-pressed apple waft from this crisp, easy-drinking Riesling. Refreshingly light on its feet, with sprightly lemon and lime acidity, it finishes moderately long with delicate apple and pear flavors.","White","Riesling","US",63260
"88129","Aromas of acacia flower, fresh stone fruit and nut all come together in the glass. The juicy palate offers up white peach, green apple and a citrus note while crisp acidity provides support. Mineral and white almond notes delineate the finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",88129
"99941","Coming from one of the strongest vintages of the last decade and with a full five years in bottle, this blend of Pepper Bridge (60%) and Minnick Hills fruit brings aromas of smoke, barrel spice, cranberry, cherry and dark berry. The dark-fruit flavors are rich, luscious and palate coating. It brings a sense of hedonism and balance that is impossible to ignore.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99941
"56445","This fresh, light and cherry-flavored wine has acidity, soft tannins and bright fruit. It's all about the crisp fruitiness, ready to drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",56445
"20939","Standard and proper, this is made in the popular style. It tastes sweet, with buttercream, buttered popcorn, pineapple and peach flavors, followed by a smoky, oaky tone and good balancing acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",20939
"53862","I Poggiarelli opens with fleshy, dark concentration and brawny aromas of smoked bacon, dark fruit and spice. But don't be swayed by your first impressions. The high acidity and overall crispness offered here cuts out any of the overdone softness or chewiness you might initially expect.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",53862
"5659","Four clones, aged in 50% new French oak, constitute the heart and soul of this outstanding reserve. Redolent with a fertile mix of moist earth, compost, tobacco and floral highlights, it fills the mouth with a rich and seamless mix of plums, baked cherries and barrel notes. It leaves a tantalizing trail of mocha, toasted hazelnuts and caramel as it winds dreamily through a lingering finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5659
"53480","Made with 95% Schiava Grossa and 5% Lagrein, this bright wine conveys aromas of red currant and violet. The savory, easy-drinking palate doles out crunchy red cherry and baking spices. It's balanced with crisp acidity and soft, smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",53480
"1265","This is a delicious and ripe-fruited wine. Dominated by Fernão Pires, it has an apple-puree texture: smooth and creamy. The wine has an edge of light acidity at the end to give it a lift. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",1265
"32006","Appetizing and warmly generous pear notes characterize the nose. The palate has the same, friendly fruit, boosted by some residual sugar. The plump fruit is countered by ample lemony freshness that creates an inherent balance. The finish is just off dry, but very refreshing.","White","Pinot Gris","France",32006
"95716","Spicy, peppery cherry and plum aromas precede a medium-bodied palate with grip but not much depth. This tastes warm and spicy, with driving berry flavors. A fresh, lightly woody finish fits the wine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",95716
"97414","The multi-dimensional, hedonistic nose of honey and exotic spices promises big things to come. The palate could have a bit more complexity but overall we have few complaints. A crisp finish keeps the slight residual sugar from seeming cloying.","White","Pinot Gris","France",97414
"45768","Vanilla, honey, citrus and spice aromas lead this luscious white blend from Bellingham. On the palate, vanilla, lemon and creamy white fruit all mingle in a round, integrated character, but are spun with spice. A pretty, appealing white with something for everyone.","White","White Blend","South Africa",45768
"95568","Blackberry, licorice, black pepper, uncrushed cloves and pencil shavings emerge from this wine by veteran Steve Dooley. It's richly layered on the palate, with dried strawberry, fennel, black earth, oregano and chopped dried sage, providing a flavorful offering from his home vineyard.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95568
"103828","This is one of a trio of single-vineyards bottlings from this producer. It comes from the village of Fuissé and is situated in a small valley. Elegant and perfumed, the touch of wood aging enhances the white-fruit flavor. The aftertaste is juicy while also ripe. Drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",103828
"45439","Here's a hit from Tuscany that boasts rich concentration and thick layers of fruit, spice, cola, molasses and almond. The color is gorgeous and so is the mouthfeel that really comes alive thanks to the wine's delicate balance between fruit and tonic freshness.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",45439
"66669","This is the third bottling of this wine, which employs whole-cluster fermentation to provoke a slower ferment and mellowed tannin. It succeeds, though it doesn't hold back, showing plenty of firm tannin backbone seasoned by clove, black tea, sage and anise. The acidity tingles on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66669
"22927","Now firmly in its new cellars, Clerc-Milon's wine is performing at the top of its form. This is a dense wine with juicy acidity as well as sweet tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. They give a ripe wine that is finely structured. The juicy aftertaste, typical of this vintage, is appealing although it does not detract from its power and longevity. Drink from 2022.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",22927
"48494","Tart and earthy, this unusual Pinot does not lack for flavor interest. Cranberry fruit, sharp acidity, a streak of cola, a hint of wintergreen and a slight bitterness to the finish keep the palate on its toes (if such is possible).","Red","Pinot Noir","US",48494
"39799","Huge intensity, inky concentration and rich texture characterize this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot from coastal Tuscany. Aromas of cherry, toast and exotic spice are carefully woven within.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",39799
"55609","This wine does a great imitation of a Port at a lighter alcohol level. The color is deep and inky, the aromas are concentrated and uberripe, and the texture is thick, nicely tannic yet smooth. Bring on the chocolate or cigars.","Red","Red Blend","US",55609
"7963","Leafy cranberry aromas smell a bit like wet cement. This is choppy and drawing on the palate, with sharp acidity that creates tartness. Core flavors of herbal, leafy red-berry fruits are briny and finish with a spot of resiny oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",7963
"65302","A soft, simple wine, the tannins set the pace, but the fruit doesn't quite follow. It is relatively light, with some red fruits and good acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",65302
"56039","This opens with aromas of coconut, roasted coffee bean and steeped plum. The dense, extracted palate offers oak extract, blueberry syrup, espresso and a confectionary note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",56039
"71836","A viscous, floral explosion of beautiful fruit, this wine is bright in acidity, with concentrated flavor. Textured, it's meant for the table, where it will play well with a range of rich foods.","White","Viognier","US",71836
"26772","When this wine was launched in 1987, it was the first in the region to be fermented in wood. That wood aging has continued. This latest release (Sauvignon Blanc, Mauzac and Muscadelle) by Jean-Marc Balaran gives a beautiful wine that is finely balanced between tightly crisp fruit and smoother, creamy spice and wood flavors. The wine is ready to drink.","White","White Blend","France",26772
"19039","White peach, melon and lime flavors are pure and pristine. A kiss of honey sweetens the palate, lingering softly alongside a spritz of lemony acidity. Enjoy now through 2016 for its crystalline character.","White","Riesling","Germany",19039
"64840","The aromas are clean, intense and penetrating and exhibit ripe black fruit with measured background shadings of spice, vanilla, toast and distant herbal tones. The blend of Syrah and Petit Verdot (with 25% other varieties) showcases the full beauty of its vintage in a feminine and understated way. But at the same time, this wine is determined and powerful.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",64840
"91828","Feathery, lifted notes of citrus, lemon zest and leaf announce a lightness of touch. Some topnotes of chamomile tisane swing alongside. The palate is fresh, taut, dry and light-footed. Deeper notions of fruit are still just hinted at, a core of fruit that still takes time before it is unlocked. Purity and elegance mark this one out.","White","Riesling","France",91828
"77689","Subtle lemon hints and zesty freshness mellow a little on the creamy but nonetheless very slender, graceful palate. Elegance and purity are hallmarks here and it is depth rather than power that convinces. Very clean finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",77689
"61324","This wine has herbal, floral aromas and a candied lemon flavor. Medium-bodied, it is fruitier and seemingly sweeter than many of its peers.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",61324
"62464","Ripe black cherry, blackberry and black pepper sensations dominate this brooding blend of 86% Sangiovese and 14% Syrah. The spicy, dense palate is forward and warm accompanied by bracing tannins that carry through to the finish. It's shy on fresh acidity so best enjoy this soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",62464
"30622","This blend of Sémillon and Rolle is ripe and fat. It has a rich character that is crispened by a herbal edge. Now that it is mature, it's well balanced while keeping plenty of fruit. There is a nutty soft aftertaste. Drink now.","White","White Blend","France",30622
"93984","This big, ripe wine is soft and round, with integrated tannins. It evokes licorice, blackberry jam and toast on the palate, with mountain sage and molasses notes that linger on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93984
"59407","For such a small price, this off-dry Riesling offers surprising refreshment and enjoyment. It's straightforward and fruity, bursting with white-peach and pear flavors, yet remarkably pristine in style. Zesty lemon-lime acidity showers the midpalate and leads a long rejuvenating finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",59407
"70479","Eschewing new French oak entirely and with just 10% second fill, it's lightly aromatic with notes of apple and stone fruit. With no malolactic fermentation, the fruit flavors are medium-bodied and sweet, showing a sense of balance that carries through to the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",70479
"105830","This wine brings fruit-forward aromas of cranberry, red Fruit Roll-Ups and spice. It's tart, with the flavors seemingly lacking in concentration, backed by lightly gritty tannins.","Red","Merlot","US",105830
"53990","This sleekly styled wine displays aromas of citrus peel, green apple and Bosc pear. The citrus flavors are lightly spritzy, bringing a sense of lightness and freshness. It's perfect for a summer day.","White","Pinot Gris","US",53990
"77341","This is already drying out, its fruit fading and its mouthfeel turning a bit woody. There's a trace of of tart berry fruit, with plenty of drying tannins. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",77341
"13426","This blend of 47% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah is reminiscent of a walk through the dewy sagebrush, with dried wild herbs most prominent alongside cola, rustic plum and mulberry and a hint of pine forest. Those forest-like flavors show on the sip as well, with bay leaf, green peppercorn and a savory salts enhancing the baked berry and tangy plum skin elements—a GSM with teeth and structure.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",13426
"46205","This Cabernet Sauvignon, with 11% Merlot added, offers intense ripeness and a plush texture of soft tannins. Rich blackberry jam and chocolate flavors are layered with soy and leather notes, benefitting from integrated oak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",46205
"82571","This is full of steely acidity as well as complex fruit. It is rich, full of toast and spice that show up the generous swathes of yellow fruits that are just beginning to show their glory. It will develop over many years. Drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",82571
"18227","Long Island is not typically known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but in the hands of winemaker Anthony Nappa (who also crafts excellent Cabs at Raphael), the variety shows remarkable promise. Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly “savage” in style. Sharp cranberry notes and mineral tones lend edge to a lingering finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",18227
"8389","This is a big wine both in terms of consistency and alcohol (17%). In fact, it's too big in many respects and it's hard to image what foods can stand up to this power. The wine is redolent of brambly sour notes of earth and forest floor and there's a touch of bitter astringency on the close.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",8389
"73460","Blueberry, black plum, dark chocolate, coffee and a little asphalt show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is medium bodied and relatively straightforward, yet shows a depth of noticeable tannins and dark fruit flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",73460
"1910","Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1910
"95743","Marked by jammy citrus and tropical flavors and crisp acidity, this is a standard Chardonnay. It shows the oaky, caramelized notes that Americans love in this most popular white wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",95743
"31768","Lemon butter, shreds of nectarine and a dash of sea salt make appearances on the fairly faint nose of this wine from San Jose-based winemaker Adam Comartin. The wine comes alive once sipped, with white peach flesh, lemony acidity and chalky grip, all culminating in a zing that goes on for minutes, finishing with a touch of marzipan.","White","Chardonnay","US",31768
"4744","This is a powerful Cabernet comprised of all the key players. The nose is oaky, with coconut and vanilla aromas alongside fast and furious spiced berry scents. A meter-pushing palate tastes of spiced cherry, blackberry, herbs and chocolate, while the finish simmers with coffee and mocha notes. Drink through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",4744
"3279","With hints of mint, and a firm structure from wood as well as tannins, this is a flattering wine. The tannins are rich, layered within the jammy black berry fruits. This is a wine for aging, but is deceptively attractive now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",3279
"12996","A Bordeaux saved from its high alcohol by its acidity. There is power and superripe fruit yet parallel to these is the black currant acidity that cuts right through. Age for 1–2 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",12996
"67882","This gorgeous wine opens with scents of ripe, dark-skinned berry, cake spice, star anise and a balsamic note. The delicious palate tastes of layers of juicy raspberry, black cherry, licorice and a hint of tobacco framed in firm refined tannins. It already shows impressive depth but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2030.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",67882
"21655","This wine from a single 25-acre vineyard in the appellation is lushly spicy in red currant, plum and clove, with seasonings of black pepper. Lively in the glass with balanced acidity and sumptuous weight and texture, it's lovely, focused and bold.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21655
"83900","The soft delicacy to this wine is compelling, inviting and surprising, given the power of the vintage and the relative warmth of the vineyard site in the appellation's Middle Reach. Floral with rose, it's deceptively fruity, hiding its depth of black cherry and citrus to the end.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83900
"76446","For a Grenache-dominated (70%) blend, this shows outstanding structure. the firm tannins are slightly drying right now, but should smooth out nicely by 2012 and the wine should continue to drink well through at least 2020. Ripe cherry and cassis notes are framed by subtle cedary oak, imparting a sophisticated elegance to the long finish.","Red","G-S-M","Australia",76446
"54697","Petite Sirah and Syrah are included in this intensely fruity wine, aged for one year in French and American oak, 25% of it new. Aromas and flavors of barbecue smoke provide a hint of char, offset by the background sweetness of vanilla.","Red","Zinfandel","US",54697
"15706","Top flight Merlot, brimming with ripe black cherry, blackberry, chocolate, smoke, sage, thyme, anise and pepper notes. It's all framed in silky ripe tannins, smooth, sleek and lush. The finish is long. -J.M.","Red","Merlot","US",15706
"4633","The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.","Red","Merlot","US",4633
"42415","A classy Cabernet, this wine shows the potential of this emerging San Benito County appellation. It's dry and smooth, with firm but supple tannins that provide grip to the blackberry, cherry and black currant flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42415
"51941","This estate-grown, pure varietal effort is exceptionally rich and succulent. The flavors of sugared grapefruit, lemon pulp and rind and sweet tea are concentrated and lingering. Despite the impression of sweetness, it's not a dessert wine, just an especially ripe and rich one.","White","Viognier","US",51941
"91177","Rather spare despite the cherry-berry, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are ultralight, and the acidity you'd expect from this cool coastal appellation isn't there. That leaves alcohol and fruit and a certain flabbiness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91177
"62576","Simonsig's 2015 Avec Chêne is a bit more retrained in its overt woodiness than previous bottlings, with herbal notes of grass and fynbos before fruit tones of green plum and white melon. The fresh and easy palate offers bright acidity and juicy flavors of citrus and apple, framed by spice and toast accents. Well balanced and accessible now, enjoy through 2020.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",62576
"49128","A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040.","White","Riesling","France",49128
"53177","Heavy and jammy for a rosé, with strong flavors of cherry, oranges and raspberries. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo.","Rosé","Rosé","US",53177
"21714","From one of Barbaresco's most celebrated vineyard crus, this ruby-colored wine exhibits loads of intensity and power in the form of cherry, cassis, leather, tar and cola. The wine's compact, tonic mouthfeel would make a great companion to rich, sophisticated cuisine.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",21714
"38899","This bottling is an ode to Bill Foley's Texas roots. It shows dried strawberry, rich olallieberry, baked cherry, black-cardamom cream and plum cookies on the deliciously spiced, fruit-forward nose. The palate is refreshing and fresh, with black raspberry and black-pepper flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",38899
"8809","This annually anticipated bottling offers a blend of Doug Margerum's top barrels from a variety of vineyards. In this vintage, aromas of baking spice and red fruit come with minty sagebrush lift. Herbs, from oregano to dried thyme, play a central role on the palate, with red cherry fruit and a tighter, tart plum skin finish, proving slightly lighter in style.","Red","Syrah","US",8809
"5087","Briny citrus aromas announce a palate with citric acidity. Similar briny citrus flavors are one-dimensional, while notes of hay and green herbs pop up on a racy finish.","White","Albariño","Spain",5087
"95071","This nicely structured Pinot Grigio shows a ""ramato"" or copper color and slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch, bitter almond and ripe melon. The structure is bigger and more defined than a standard Italian white.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",95071
"42984","Altesino is part of an elite group of vintners that really put Montalcino on the international wine map. Its 2008 Brunello shows some of the nervous acidity that is typical of the vintage, but it also delivers soft tones of cherry fruit, spice and chocolate that round off any sharp edges.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",42984
"98973","Full blackberry and black-plum aromas come with controlled but obvious oak. This feels tight and direct on the palate, with ripeness and weight. Blackberry, cassis and chocolaty oak flavors finish woody and peppery, with drying tannins. This is a powerful, oaky Garnacha made for the modern palate.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",98973
"50171","This shows the fruity side of Cabernet Franc. No wood aging, just red fruits, spice and stalky tannins, with a hint of smokiness and a light structure. Drink from 2015.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",50171
"74484","Tight and precise, with sharply defined edges, this needs hours of breathing time. Dense black fruit, pretty herbal grace notes, supple, slightly grainy tannins. Built for the long term.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",74484
"78952","This is a medium-bodied, crisp and tangy wine with fresh parsley aromas and lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. It's well balanced, restrained and will be very versatile with food.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",78952
"100912","A light, easy Pinot Blanc, rounded, creamy and with just the right balance of fresh acidity. It's simple, attractive now, ready to drink.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",100912
"31498","For the price, this is a pretty good Merlot for drinking now. It's soft and approachable with cherry, blueberry, red currant and oak flavors, along with a sightly sweet finish.","Red","Merlot","US",31498
"21249","From a 17-acre Merlot-dominated vineyard, this is a dry wine, where the tannins dominate the fruit. The wine has a bitter edge from too much extraction. The hints of fruit are not quite enough.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",21249
"86411","Hailing from the recently designated Paso Highlands subappellation, this hearty wine shows earthy aromas of nutmeg, iron, hot rocks, loam and cherry extract. It's lush and ripe with cassis and black cherry fruit, yet shows a more elegant chalkiness on the palate as well, rounded out by cocoa powder.","Red","Zinfandel","US",86411
"74064","Ripe, loamy raisin and kirsch aromas set up a pinched clampy tannic palate that grabs like Velcro. This tastes of vanilla and creamy oak along with herbal red berry fruits. Resiny, vanilla-driven flavors crowd out residual berry fruit on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",74064
"3483","Aromas of mature orchard fruit and botanical herb lift out of the glass. The aromas repeat on the bright palate along with a juicy hint of nectarine and an almond note.","White","Garganega","Italy",3483
"77602","A bit obviously pungent and sweaty, this passion fruit-scented wine is direct and to the point, marrying medium body with a tangy, mouthwatering finish. If you enjoy slightly feral citrus notes, you may rate it higher.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",77602
"33862","This wine has more body and a richer mouthfeel than many of its peers, with mild floral and almond flavors and a touch of butterscotch.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",33862
"13213","Soft and sweet, like a melted fruit tart dessert in wine form. High alcohol gives a burn to the Porty raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",13213
"101749","Smooth in texture and very modest in flavor, this has a faint aroma of Golden Delicious apples and hint of almond. Medium body and moderate acidity make it easy to swallow.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",101749
"41450","From a relatively young vineyard (planted in 2000), this is a nicely complex effort, showing hints of rose pollen, cherries and herbal tea. It's round in the mouth, yet virtually weightless, showing off a wonderfully silky texture that persists through the finish. Without any real track record, opt for drinking this one on the young side (now–2012).","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",41450
"83085","Mature mealy apricot aromas lead to a spent palate with unfocused cidery flavors that taste old and demanding. This finishes heavy, pulpy and without much point or pleasure. Albariño is meant to be fresh and friendly, but this is neither.","White","Albariño","Spain",83085
"65039","A green, grassy quality that recalls lime and garden herb first opens the nose of this bright Soave. The wine is easy and thin with a drying touch of talc powder on the close.","White","Garganega","Italy",65039
"48658","Among the most northerly of the run of Beaune premier crus, the wine is structured but the structure is cushioned by the ripe red-berry fruits to give a generous wine. Backed by tannins, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48658
"39652","A little one-dimensional, this soft Pinot has forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, vanilla, mint and smoke. It's an easy wine to like, with a silky texture and clean, spicy finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",39652
"87619","The vineyard needs a warm vintage to fully ripen, which 2010 definitely wasn't. The wine is acidic and green, with an ammonia edge to the pineapples, mangoes and limes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",87619
"104009","Clumsy out of the starting blocks, with creamy chocolate aromas, leather and leafiness. The palate is solid and concentrated, but short on elegance and depth of flavor. What's here is blocky and chunky, but also sort of green and flaky. Decent but with some issues, and just good on its best day. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",104009
"65850","A pale pink-orange color, this Pinot Noir rosé displays unusual aromas of blood orange, herbs and reduction. It drinks off dry, with mandarin orange and herb flavors, finishing tart.","Rosé","Rosé","US",65850
"13160","Lightly spiced up front, with cinnamon and nutmeg aromas adding complex sweetness to cherry and cassis scents. It feels juicy and sincere, with a mix of berry, plum, herb, spice and licorice flavors. This turns toward vanilla on the finish. A traditional wine that's ready now.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",13160
"74796","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah initially smells cool and earthy, then more woody, spicy and animal-like. On the palate, this is concentrated and deep, with milder tannins than the winery's varietal Petit Verdot. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are powerful, while burnt wood, bitter chocolate and peppery flavors drive a muscular finish. Drink now through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",74796
"100868","Grenache and Syrah are the anchors here, with just a splash of Mourvèdre. Lush red fruits, long and balanced, capture a pleasing whiff of umami, along with nuances of cured meat, licorice and sea salt.","Red","G-S-M","US",100868
"47640","Dusty minerals tones, dried mushrooms and luscious black cherries collide on the nose and palate of this unusual New York Sangiovese. It's a bold, full-bodied and forward wine, but brisk acidity and fine-grained tannins lend elegance and style.","Red","Sangiovese","US",47640
"77475","An opulently ripe, wood-aged wine that's both fruity and textured. It has weight, richness, a lightly mineral texture with crisp apple and green plum flavors. Give this attractive while serious wine until the end of 2014.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",77475
"82993","This is a delicate signature white, with lovely honeysuckle and flint aromas. High-toned acidity buoys layers of grapefruit and preserved lemon flavor, finishing with well-defined minerality.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",82993
"89060","A simple, diluted and somewhat intensely ripe white, this is youthful, still tense and one-dimensional.","White","Chardonnay","US",89060
"421","From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice. With a depth of body and soft, integrated tannin, it's complex without being overpowering, finishing in a mix of sautéed mushroom and forest floor.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",421
"105436","Tradition in Alsace means an entry-level bottling. This fruity wine is a good introduction to Gewurztraminer with its touch of spice, rounded texture and fresh acidity at the end. Drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",105436
"56987","This smells like plums and blueberries, tastes smooth and rather rich, showing light spicy, oak accents over the plummy flavors. It's medium bodied, rather light on tannins and acidity, so it has a soft texture overall.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",56987
"61270","Saffredi is one of the most exciting super Tuscans of the year. The blend is Cabernet, Merlot and Alicante and the results of underscore the immense potential of Maremma. The wine is vibrant, intense and sprightly with an outstandingly complex offering of pristine aromas: ripe cherry, floral essences, red apple and subdued almond.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",61270
"10289","Barrel-fermented, this is medium-sized all the way around, offering medium acidity, texture, body and finish. Flavors are autumnal in juicy lemon-lime, Golden Delicious apple and creamy pear.","White","Chardonnay","US",10289
"1835","Tenuta di Sesta is run by a perfect father-mother-daughter-son team and is located in one of the least-traveled corners of Montalcino. The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age. Cellar this wine 10 years.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",1835
"53280","This wine shows a ton of oak influence, from the smoky charred aromas to the sweet-seeming maple syrup flavors to the velvety clinging texture. It is medium bodied, lush in mouthfeel and high in spice content that dominates the fruit flavors underneath.","Red","Merlot","US",53280
"42874","This easy-drinking, estate-grown, Bordeaux-style blend tilts more toward Merlot than Cabernet Sauvignon in this new vintage.

"27403","A strong element of minty eucalyptus shows in this wine that is full bodied on the palate and integrated in oak, with an accent of clove. Fruity berry pie and mocha round out a softened, approachable texture that'll pair well at the table.","Red","Merlot","US",27403
"102279","Fleshy berry aromas are lush, inviting and surrounded by notes of shoe polish and violet petal. This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-led multigrape blend that's chunky on the palate.

"94665","Moris Farms offers a very generous and intense interpretation of Morellino with remarkable integrity of fruit and a big, plump, juicy style. The wine could pair with roast pork or fried chicken. A small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is added to the wine.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",94665

Beautiful to drink now, and it should age effortlessly for the next 10 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",85052
"60840","This is a brooding selection, with layers of dark fruits (think blackberry, plum and cherry), chewing tobacco and bay leaf alongside a hint of vanilla bean. The palate is rich and dense, with a texture like crushed satin. Tight and flavorful now, this would benefit from a bit more time in the cellar; try after 2015.","Red","Grenache","France",60840
"39793","The densely planted vineyard that gives this wine its name yields fine concentration, dense pear and melon flavors. The apple skin texture also shows a distinct bite of acidity. Wafts of fruitiness combine with pepper right to the end. An impressive, ageworthy wine.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",39793
"29172","Spicy white pepper pervades this rich, rounded red. Structured tannins call for meat if this is to be drunk now. These will mellow by 2016 in cellar and the ripe, crunchy red fruit will come to the fore.","Red","Red Blend","Austria",29172

"73340","Firmly structured but elegant, this offers aromas of blue flower, tobacco, tilled earth, black fruit and a balsamic note. The vibrant palate boasts wonderful intensity, weaving notes of white pepper, baking spice, savory herb, licorice and mineral around a black cherry core.

The wine has good complexity combined with a firm and appetizing texture due to moderate tannins and acidity.","Red","Barbera","US",32219
"32181","In a blind tasting, it's hard to imagine many people would identify this wine as from Washington, due to the coolness of the vintage and the style. It's almost impenetrable when first opened, with brooding notes of graphite, exotic spice, herbs, toast and dark fruit. The acids are mouthwatering, the tannins firm and tightly wound, and they need significant time to uncoil. But when they do, the wine glorious. Give it at least until 2019 in the cellar or a 24+ hour decant. One of the highlights of the vintage.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",32181
"102067","A standout in a flight of more expensive wines, this five-grape blend leans heavily on the Bordeaux varietals, with a bit of Syrah as well.

"58126","This is produced from 40-year-old vines that are planted in a walled vineyard. It is a beautifully concentrated combination of pure ripe yellow fruits and intense acidity.

"43411","Going through a tough patch, with the primary fruit beginning to fall out and drier, earthier notes marching in. The grapes come from the cool climate vineyards of Bien Nacido and Watch Hill, and the wine shows consequent dryness and acidity. A year or two ago, blackberries would have overwhelmed. Now, they're drying out, permitting charred meat, mushroom and herb notes to co-star. Drink up.","Red","Syrah","US",43411
"28695","This Pinot offers bright tart cherry fruit and earthy spice in good proportion and is softly textured. From the remote Mendocino Ridge and aged in entirely French oak, it's still young and exhibiting plenty of oaky toast on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28695

"25461","The pedigree and vintage of these impeccably grown grapes are apparent in this wine. It's dry in style, but rich and concentrated with black cherries, cola, exotic spice and anise flavors, balanced with fine acidity and tannins. It's a big wine, and should develop bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25461

"94371","Maison Louis Jadot's Willamette Valley project continues to bear fruit and has increased the production of this entry-level cuvée.

"80080","This winery atop the mountains overlooking Silicon Valley makes amazingly earthy and age-worthy wines. This bottling's nose is soil-driven, with sun-baked loam laid across red cherry, condensed lilacs, cola and sandalwood aromas. The sip is structured firmly and strategically like the frame of a well-built home, where dark mulberry and savory spices reside. Drink now–2028.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80080
"72849","Dark and saturated in color, this has earthy and meaty aromas like bloody, rare steak and charred bone—that sort of proteinous spirit. The actual fruit flavor is incredibly rich and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and crisp bacon. The impression is of a sweet, delicious Cabernet that's a touch warm in alcohol, but lush and refined.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72849
"28264","Perhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit.","White","Chardonnay","US",28264
"84278","Morrison Lane's Sangiovese includes a little Syrah and Carmenère in the blend, giving it a light sprinkling of peppery spice. Tart red fruits fill in the rest.","Red","Sangiovese","US",84278
"24231","This is a big, powerful wine, packed with flavor. It's very good, even succulent, and startles with the intensity of its fruit, but has an edge of overripe raisins that may limit ageability. With firm tannins, the tastes suggest baked, pastry-filling blackberries, mulberries and currants.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",24231
"95035","Combine a warm year with too much time in bottle and this is what you get. This chunky, barrel-fermented Verdejo smells and tastes of early oxidation; it's creamy on the palate and strained in terms of flavors. Wheaty, leesy, faded melon and apple flavors have lost their verve.","White","Verdejo","Spain",95035
"87003","Fresh apple, lemon and crushed mineral tones are demure on the nose but gain power and concentration on the palate of this bold, richly textured Chardonnay.

"58140","Aromas of plum jam, blackberry extract and dark baking spice lead the nose. The smooth dense palate tastes of dried black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco framed in velvety tannins. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while notes of raisin and exotic spice close the firm finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58140
"7558","Too sharp in texture, with a cut of acidity that emphasizes the white pepper, and seems to bring out some greenness. Other than that, you'll find a smoothly tannic wine, with blackberry and currant fruit.","Red","Syrah","US",7558
"89499","Dry, spicy, leathery aromas are herbal but solid. This feels full and balanced but rudimentary, with cherry, cassis, chocolate and herbal flavors. A finish of dark-fruit flavors comes with overt oak notes, peppery spice and heat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",89499
"21782","Dark, thick and aromatic, this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah can stand alongside others selling for two or three times the price. It's a supple mix of dark fruits and spicy herb; it almost bristles with sharp hints of nettle, pepper and green tea.

Organic Tempranillo, Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon comprise this tight, dark, rugged wine with forward tannins and acidity bolstering cherry, cassis and   cola flavors. Made in the modern, ripe style. Drink now–2010.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",24219
"45231","Nearing the age of four years, this Cabernet remains hefty in tannins, but it's not undrinkable, because those tannins are soft and lush. In fact, they're an integral part of the network that makes the wine so interesting, which also includes the classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries and cassis. Drink this elegant wine over the next six years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45231
"22541","Lovely attack, plummy and evolved, with no rough edges. The fruit is soft and sweet, layered and full, and the overall palate impression is of elegance and balance. This is a terrific drink-me-now bottle with nicely aged flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",22541
"19778","Meaty, rubbery aromas open it up, and it evolves into a dark, chunky, aggressive type of wine. The palate is big and round, with medium tannins and dark, slightly burnt flavors of blackberry and licorice. The finish shows coffee and extract, but not much length or refinement. Husky and ripe more than sleek and elevated.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",19778
"33566","Ripe, jammy blueberry and blackberry aromas come with a hint of graphite and sweet-smelling oak. This is choppy and edgy in feel, with coconut, blackberry and tart, drawing flavors.","Red","Malbec","Chile",33566

"91084","Though Adelsheim offers a large assortment of single-vineyard Pinots, this is the first they've made from Zenith. It surely won't be the last. Concentrated, thick black raspberry and black cherry fruit centers a substantial wine, laced with vivid streaks of vanilla, tobacco and spice. The immediate impact of the fruit is amplified by the density on the palate, and the finish, loaded with baking spices, reflects the aging in one-third new French oak barrels.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91084
"74349","Gritty, spicy aromas of kirsch, dried cherry and cinnamon set up a narrow, high-acid palate that's fresh but grating.

It's layered feeling on the finish, with a bit of syrupy residue.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",86044
"54508","This hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a great go-to wine for a crowd. Cabernet leads the way with cedar, cranberry and tobacco notes, clipped by sizable tannin. As it opens, layers of dense raspberry and vanilla flavors unfurl.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",54508
"16442","This is technically a white wine but with eyes closed it could be taken for a big red.

"27672","Strong and direct in licorice, cassis, cocoa and smoky cedar flavors, the wine is balanced with adequate acids. It's also thoroughly dry, a good thing.

"38153","Gritty, muddled dark-fruit aromas come with burnt overtones. This has a hard, grinding palate along with roasted blackberry and raisin flavors. A minty character and hard tannins drive the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",38153
"11685","Initial fiery aromas give way to notes of creamy oak, raspberry, plum and chewing gum.

Modest comlexity on the finish comes with a candied fruit flavor.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",11685
"102587","This offers aromas of pressed rose, cherry marinated in spirits, aromatic herb and menthol.

"69774","Labels like this one are probably what confuse American consumers, but the truth is that this is just great wine.

"94726","Oak and resin aromas are overpowering and dominant. The wine is big and woody in the mouth, so much so that it almost collapses upon itself, leaving resiny flavors of melon and underdeveloped citrus. Flat on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",94726
"9705","The bouquet of this wine starts off subtle and dainty, needing time to become more expressive and reveal scents of cured meat, sweet smoke, violet and small red berries. Gamy notes are at the forefront of the medium-weight palate, with underlying flavors of red cherry and currant. A smoky, savory and spicy selection; drink now–2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","South Africa",9705

As it develops, the wine will become richer and more intense.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",58181
"74510","This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit.

"25993","Floral berry and plum aromas are direct and pure, emphasizing fruit over oak. A punchy palate follows the nose, while bright plum and berry flavors complete the package. This captures the essence of Malbec while not going overboard.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",25993
"100292","One tightly packed parcel of citrus zest and white pepper, this is streamlined, compact and linear, making it a moreish refresher. It's light-footed nature makes it very easy to drink. Ideal for hot days where real refreshment is needed.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",100292
"71004","Owned since 1999 by the Kressman family of Latour-Martillac in Pessac-Léognan, this wine reflects fine winemaking thanks to its ripe tannins and the fruitiness of the vintage. It is juicy, rich with blackberry fruits and already shows a fine balance. It is ready to drink.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",71004
"48933","A cool, alpine streak runs through this easygoing but refreshing Riesling, revealed through greenish glimmers of pine frond and fresh herb. Off dry in style, it calibrates sweet-tart green plum and apple notes against streaks of lime and lemon. Drink now.","White","Riesling","Germany",48933
"105584","With no concession to fashionably pale rosés, this is a boldly colored wine. It has red-berry fruits, a soft caramel texture and crisp acidity to balance. Of course, it is ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",105584
"54181","Honey, melon and cider aromas precede a juicy palate with no real texture or body. This is citrusy, tart and green tasting, with briny saltiness to the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",54181
"72296","This is a balanced, fruity wine with a beautiful line of fragrant acidity. Apples, pears and a touch of chewy tannin all work together well to give a wine that is both firmly textured and fresh with fruit. It could be drunk now, although it will be best from 2016.","White","Chardonnay","France",72296
"99062","It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.","Red","Merlot","US",99062
"46113","Fruity in blackberry and dark cherry with a meaty undercurrent, Heritage blends 47% Barbera with 22% Petite Sirah, 18% Alicante Bouschet and 13% Carignane. Meaty and brisk in acidity, it has a brightness to it traditionally inspired field blends don't often have, amidst a core of power and follow-through. This is a great Lodi wine.","Red","Red Blend","US",46113
"28111","Pure Chardonnay, Luxe is finished at lower alcohol (at least according to the fact sheets) than the other sparklers in this lineup. It is definitely the wine with the most depth; it has a roundly fruity core of lemon cake and light citrus.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",28111
"64076","There's a fine wine hiding inside this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, which contains Cabernet Franc and Merlot. But its qualities are buried beneath strong tannins. The fruit is impossibly young, all jammy cherries and blackberries, and new oak sticks out in the form of buttered toast. It's all very imposing, so don't even think about drinking it anytime soon. Should begin to blossom around 2018, and will be going strong for another decade.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",64076
"5385","Green apple with a squeeze of fresh lemon makes for a basic and easy unoaked Chardonnay. While standard and simple, this is a perfectly enjoyable wine to pair with lighter fare.","White","Chardonnay","US",5385
"48119","A blend of fruit from Boushey (70%) and Olsen vineyards, this wine offers subdued aromas of red fruit, coffee, herb and iron. The flavors are generous and full, coating the palate from end to end, with a velvety texture heightening the appeal.","Red","Syrah","US",48119
"62101","Opens with a burst of blackberry, mint, game and smoky oak, and turns rich and flavorful in the mouth, with enormous concentration and depth of flavor. Bone dry, the fancy berry flavors float in a silky texture framed by toasty oak.","Red","Syrah","US",62101
"27857","This rosé is slightly confected on the nose, but boasts ample weight and richness on the palate, along with appealing notes of raspberry, white chocolate and citrus.","Rosé","Rosé","France",27857
"83494","Exuberant aromas of espresso, smoke and dark fruit leap up from the glass. The palate is considerably more reserved with fruit and earth flavors that linger.","Red","Syrah","US",83494
"14236","On first pour, the aromas of toast, char, spice and herb show some reduction that blows off over time. The purple-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pleasing sense of purity, with the concentration dipping in the middle before coming back together on the finish.","Red","Malbec","US",14236
"13115","This wine seems slightly past peak with aromas of overripe apple, lees and pear. It's lightly sweet with the concentration not seeming all there.","White","Pinot Gris","US",13115
"33954","Seems heavy on the American oak, displaying lactic, dill-laden aromatics that partially mute the berry fruit underneath. Still, the tart berries come through on the finish—a good sign for the future. Give it a couple of years in the cellar to come together. —J.C.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",33954
"29693","Steely cranberries and earthy tannins control the palate here. As the wine sits in the mouth a certain sense of green coffee beans arises. The finish is light and supple.","Red","Syrah","US",29693
"70659","This tastes juicy, sweet and vibrant, with candied raspberry, pink bubblegum, vanilla, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. A nice Zin to drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",70659
"34338","Buttery cream is on the nose of this vineyard-designate, a relatively affordable offering from an esteemed producer in the heart of the Napa Valley. Oaky on the palate, the medium-weighted wine is nicely offset by a searingly crisp bite of lemon that peaks on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",34338
"20051","This starts off with scents of melon and wet stone. A sense of plumpness unfolds on the attack, then accelerates across the palate in a burst of bright, citrusy acids. A tactile, silky edge to the finish adds length and complexity.","White","Riesling","Australia",20051
"32862","Fruity and juicy, this attractive wine has delicious soft tannins that are already balanced with the ripe fruitiness, which suggests it will develop quickly. The wine comes from Pinhão the estate owned by the Bergqvist family. Drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",32862
"94206","Ripe aromas of dark fruit, crème de cassis and cherry liqueur. The wine is thick, juicy and chewy, with a touch of tightness or astringency on the close.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",94206
"68981","Aromatic and floral, this lovely bottle has a tangy, nicely defined core of raspberry, cranberry and pomegranate. The tannins are crisp, the acids bracing, the fruit etched in minerals, and the balance poised and appropriate to the lightness of the wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68981
"50170","Crunchy and somewhat bitter, this has tight citrus rind flavors and a whiff of vanilla. A small percentage of the blend spent a bit of time in neutral oak.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",50170
"85043","Januik's reserve blend is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Franc. The fruit is cloaked with lush layers of barrel toast, and it may require several hours of decanting for it to open up. When it does, the flavors multiply on the palate with cassis, black cherry, dark chocolate, pencil lead and wood smoke, along with dusty, mouth-coating tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",85043
"13409","This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner. The more you get to know it in the glass, the more you can identify delicate floral and ethereal aromas that point to a traditional Chianti Classico style. Sharp acidity and bright fruit flavors tell the same story in the mouth.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",13409
"22977","Succulent in red cherry and cassis, this wine has a surprising level of depth and grip. It finds its way with integrated tannins, soft layers of caramelized oak and a brightness of fruit and acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22977
"22164","A blend of Syrah, Carignan, Mourvèdre and Grenache, all in even proportion, this is a lush and dense selection that offers upfront notes of wild blackberry, boysenberry, licorice and sweet spice. The palate is lush and the texture creamy, with medium tannins and lovely chocolate and toasted-oak accents that linger long on the finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",22164
"33730","Scents of rapberry, cherry and earth make for a nice begining and lead into some attractive pepperiness on the palate but the finish drops off quickly. The wine's refreshing acidity will pair nicely with spare ribs.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",33730
"91893","Blackberry, oak, spice and chocolate aromas are dealt in equal parts. This feels ripe and fairly plush. Flavors of burnt toast, black pepper and charred wood lead secondary fruit notes across the palate and onto the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",91893
"79477","A majority of new French oak nestled this wine, contributing to its dark golden color and oak intensity on the nose and palate. Slightly sweet in ripe apple and vanilla, it will benefit greatly from the enjoyment of food alongside.","White","Chardonnay","US",79477
"16747","With a high proportion (60%) of Merlot, this is a ripe wine while also being structured. It has a dense character that comes from the still young, firm tannins. Behind these are the ripest black-currant fruits, crisp and juicy, packed with flavor as well as acidity. Drink this wine from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",16747
"79446","A tough, dark wine, needing considerable aging to bring out its balanced fruits. It has the feel of a serious, impressive wine, dominated by powerful tannins. Underneath, the fruit is dark, brooding and firm. Give this wine at least five years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",79446
"21750","Winemaker Molly Lyman takes a delicate approach to this 100% varietal estate wine, from a longstanding vineyard in the Chiles Valley. From a block named for a farming family linked to the site, Las Flores is sanguine in cranberry and graphite, food-friendly, with a lightness despite its pronounced plum, cassis and oak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21750
"57845","Exotic fruit and pineapple open the nose of this bright Italian white. The wine shows slightly more heft and determination than your average Soave Classico and the mouthfeel delivers creamy peach and a long finish.","White","Garganega","Italy",57845
"15089","A blend of 54% Roussanne, 29% Marsanne and 17% Viognier from the sought-after vineyard site Alder Springs, this is an estate wine made in small quantities, gorgeous in apricot and white peach aromatics. Completed by a mouth-coating texture and crisp acidity on the finish, it offers balance and effusive minerality.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",15089
"100559","Formerly labeled simply as a Roussanne-Viognier blend, this is now the companion wine to Tranche's Slice of Pape Red. Here is a wine with power, balance and concentration. It's a polished, focused, utterly seductive blend, dominated by the Roussanne, but with the Viognier contributing brightness and a floral top note. There's a riot of fruit flavors, from citrus to tangerine to Macintosh apple and spiced pear, with a slightly saline finish.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",100559
"84419","Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84419
"102494","There is a great amount of dark strawberry freshness on the nose of this intriguing and seductive bottling, enhanced by gravel, pepper and a distinctive mintiness. Peppercorns, beef char and smoke hit the palate alongside blueberry and boysenberry, with plum-skin tartness and firm tannins ensuring ageability.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",102494
"99365","With a ruby-clear color and a light mouthfeel, this low-alcohol Pinot also is a little light in flavor. The cherries and red currants are compromised by a problematic mushroom taste.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",99365
"67812","From a vineyard atop Pritchard Hill, this wine delivers big, bold flavors and structure. Integrated tannins form around flavors of cloves, baking spices and dried herbs. Blackberry and black cherry pop in between a flinty, earthy side. Drink through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",67812
"39217","Super smooth and open, this loose and lovely Merlot coats the palate with pretty cherry and raspberry fruit, slathered in tasty milk chocolatey oak. Not a deep wine, but deeply enjoyable, and ready to drink right now.","Red","Merlot","US",39217
"16419","Rich, full of citrus and ripe apple flavors, this is a sophisticated wine. The mineral texture and the dense fruit flavors offer a delicious take on Sauvignon Blanc, giving complexity and ripeness. Drink this wine from 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",16419
"89334","This has a bright, light-gold color, substantial aromas and flavors of oak and baking spices. The texture is smooth, with a sense of softness in the balance, and the wine leans toward richness rather than crispness. Impressions like hazelnut, vanilla, sweet pear and nutmeg provide a mouthful of flavor.","White","Chardonnay","US",89334
"91604","Dusty clay and spice notes lend savory nuances to high-impact peach, nectarine and lemon in this mouthwatering Riesling. It's boldly fruity and lip-smackingly sweet-tart. Vibrant acidity leads a long luminous finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",91604
"83433","A fashionable pale-salmon color, this dainty rosé opens with delicate floral aromas of sweet pea and white clover that are framed by fruity tones of red cherry and strawberry. The palate is fleshy and fruit-forward, buoyed by ample acidity that finishes fresh.","Rosé","Rosé","France",83433
"14428","Polished aromas of roasted nuts, sea salt, Meyer lemon peel and onion skin show on the nose of this widely available bottling from the Chardonnay kings. The sip is a little bit flat in terms of texture and acidity, but there are compelling and satisfying flavors of roasted walnuts and pecans, with a citrusy acidity that rises toward the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",14428
"86599","Woodsy and thickly textured, this Weir Pinot is balanced in just-ripe cherry goodness that neatly scrapes the edge of sour-ness. Fine earth and herbal overtones show off its varietal qualities, more typical of its warmer climate than the Deep End of Anderson Valley.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86599
"100656","Sprays of rose petals and violets mingle decadently with notes of brandy-soaked cherries on this deliciously juicy Pinot Noir. Dry, yet densely concentrated in fruit, its bright acidity carries towards a soft, candy-coated cherry finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100656
"100911","Hints of garrigue herbs and bramble add depth to the bright red-berry and strawberry aromas on the nose of this wine. Juicy fruit flavors continue on to the balanced and accessible palate, alongside soft tannins and a clean, mouthwatering finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",100911
"6357","Produced with organically grown grapes, the wine is firm, still tight and with ripe black fruits. It is full, structured with enough fruitiness to balance the tannins. As it ages, this wine will come together into a rich while fruity wine. Drink from late 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",6357
"35209","Pure varietal, this pushes the winery's characteristic oaky, smoky winemaking style to the limits. There's some bright, tart raspberry fruit in the mix, but the scents and flavors of charred wood dominate from first sniff to last swallow.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",35209
"94090","This unfolding white offers lemon and oaky spice on the nose and palate, with rounded, silky flavors and a spicy finish. A bit bigger and richer, it can handle bigger dishes—think lobster, oysters, cream dishes.","White","White Blend","Greece",94090
"63312","Crisp green apple, lime and vanilla wafer mingle on the palate of this 100% Chardonnay, méthode champenoise sparkler from the Bazzano Vineyard. It drips with minerality, lively and tangy with a medium to light body that picks up depth and breadth on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",63312
"28322","This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",28322
"93145","This blend of 66% Shiraz, 16% Mourvèdre, 14% Grenache and 4% Cinsault is pure and balanced, with an immediately perceptable core of brambly berry that's accented by notes of white pepper, charred cedar, forest floor and cocoa nib. The medium-weight palate is fleshy yet firm, with spiced-fruit flavors and structured tannins. It's certainly drinkable now, but this will continue to mature and evolve nicely through 2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","South Africa",93145
"89423","This is concentrated, but it's all structure at this stage. It has rich black fruits that lie under the dense tannins, with a potentially rich powerhouse of flavor. It needs at least six years of aging.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",89423
"103018","Tobacco, cassis and vanilla notes bring the aromas and flavors, while the wine's firm structure gives a medium-weight feel and dusty texture. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",103018
"28768","A partnership between winemaker Chris Phelps, who makes the wines for Swanson, and his son, Josh, this Cab is silky in currant, cassis and black raspberry, the oak more sweet than overwhelming. With room to age through 2015–2017, let it open before enjoying.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",28768
"77323","This lightly crafted, affordable red blends in smaller percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. It works as a soft, approachable and rounded experience of moderately tannic black cherry and cola, with a streak of black pepper, graphite and cedar mixed within.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77323
"105574","Aromas of wood shop, coffee and espresso all carry over to the palate along with oak extract and toast. It lacks the fruit richness necessary to stand up to the oak.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",105574
"40989","A light, straightforward and focused wine, 100% varietal, this offers cranberry, mushroom and a complexity of tannin and oak. High acidity dances around fresh layers of strawberry and raspberry on the palate, with a grippy, cinnamon-spiced finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40989
"79336","Edging towards minerality, this is a textured wine, its acidity penetrating right through. This intense, crisp character is complimented by the balanced fruit with its ripe apricot and kiwi flavors. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",79336
"85169","This starts with a startling but tangy lemon-tea flavor. Cinnamon and plum notes enter the palate, which are underscored by rather chalky acidity, and finished with a coffee highlight.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85169
"25880","This wine blends competing elements of steely minerality and ripe, nearly sweet elements of red apple and squeezed tangerine on the nose. The flavors are also well-rounded, with apple fruit and Asian pear balanced by lemon juice acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",25880
"55931","This bottling from a winery whose owners are originally from Brittany shows peppery spice, tart red fruit, rose petal and lava rock scents on the nose. The flavors range widely from white pepper and dill to fresh-pressed strawberry and red plum, with a slight hint of caramel. Varietally pure and very fresh.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",55931
"90357","Willamette Valley Vineyards' vintner Bill Fuller planted the Draper clone vines that go into this wine at his Tualatin Vineyards in 1973. Buttery barrel flavors are immediately apparent—highlights of butterscotch, vanilla and spice around a core of ripe apple fruit. It seems to gather strength throughout the sip, with a lingering finish. Drink 2019–2030.","White","Chardonnay","US",90357
"86786","Soft, warm and smoky wine, this has a finely layered wood flavor to go with the black currant and red berry fruits. It's dry, yet warm and ripe, finishing with freshness.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",86786
"17697","Bright in cherry and cranberry, this classically styled Nebbiolo is light red in color and buoyant in acidity. A sanguine back layer brings the earthier elements of the wine to life. With not much Nebbiolo to try in California, this one is worth a taste to savor the possibilities.","Red","Nebbiolo","US",17697
"56265","The warm Fourchaume vineyard has produced a ripe, full wine that could almost come from further south in Burgundy. Just a touch of minerality keeps anchors it in Chablis. A refreshing white fruit flavor follows through into the finish. Drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",56265
"27422","The powerful blend is as big as ever in this vintage, combining Zinfandel with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Charbono. The grapes are sourced from some of Napa Valley's finest sites, including Tofanelli Vineyard in Calistoga. It's expressive and expansive in tobacco and tar, thick and rich, with a finish of bittersweet chocolate.","Red","Red Blend","US",27422
"19872","Mustard-seed aromas pierce the nose, which otherwise is mostly apple and pineapple. Lemon, green apple and passion fruit flavors are accented by the lightest touch of oregano and basil. For a cru, it's rather simple, with extremely light fruit on the finish and very little length or substance to the back end.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",19872
"63681","The winery's first release of the variety, this wine is sourced from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road in the Petaluma Gap and Sangiacomo Green Acres in Carneros. Orange-blossom aromas wrap around crisp apple and mango while the wine maintains medium weight and bright acidity, the toasted oak subtle.","White","Chardonnay","US",63681
"8808","From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8808
"14916","Pretty soft for a Pinot Noir, and lacking the structural integrity the variety needs. Nonetheless, the flavors of black and red cherries, cola, orange zest and spices are delicious. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14916
"80256","Overripe in raisin, blackberry jam and high alcohol glycerine flavors. Feels harsh and aggressive, too, with a raisinskin astringency. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80256
"106196","A big, strong Chardonnay that's impressive for it's sheer power. This offers in-your-face flavors of pineapple and apricot jam and oak. It's rich and opulent, but lacks some delicacy and grace. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",106196
"96366","This single-vineyard wine from Lonesome Spring Ranch was entirely fermented and aged in stainless steel. Aromas of plum, tobacco, flowers and orange peel lead to fresh, tart, rounded fruit flavors, with bitters on the finish. Pair it with pasta with a red sauce.","Red","Dolcetto","US",96366
"87988","This is a dry wine although the fruit does show potential. It is concentrated and firm, tannins foremost. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",87988
"10719","Black cherry and berry jam aromas bring a touch of raisin as well. The palate is mostly fresh and zesty, with medium weight and intensity along with crisp red plum and raspberry flavors. Tight, mildly acidic and a bit toasty on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",10719
"47263","With a couple of extra years already behind it, this Oregon Riesling is drinking well, but should be consumed now. It has the body of a Chardonnay, rich and round, with mixed stone fruits and a hint of bitter citrus rind. Quite dry and already mature.","White","Riesling","US",47263
"89231","This is soft, ripe and delicious, in the cult style, with heady blackberry jam, chocolate and sweet, caramelized oak flavors. It's thoroughly dry and really easy to like, with a certain dramatic impact. Drink soon.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89231
"31146","What a combination—quality on par with some of Australia's top performers at a price point that doesn't put you on the bread line. Lively, with brisk acidity, the Bin 7 has lime, grass and mineral notes and just enough viscosity to remind you that it's Riesling, not Sauvignon Blanc. Finishes long and fresh, with sour apple flavors.  Editors' Choice.","White","Riesling","Australia",31146
"54803","Named in homage to a Marquesa de Alorna who was a poet in the 18th century, this wood-aged rich wine is serious and complex. It has ripe yellow fruits that balance with the spice from the wood aging, giving a ripe creamy wine that will still age. Drink from 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",54803
"8010","A rare 100% Petit Verdot, this is dense in red and black fruit, from plum and blueberry to blackberry, ripe enough to be in a cobbler. Cinnamon dusts the top, with a puff of smoke in the background. Balanced despite its heft, it finishes soft, ready to be paired with meaty foods.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",8010
"53269","This catchy named, three-grape blend is a nice wine that's sinewy and leathery; overall it ranks as a natural and controlled reflection of Jumilla. The nose is forward and fiery, while the palate has berry-driven ripeness and plenty of oak. Better with food; the tannins are kind of scratchy with nothing to absorb them.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",53269
"97503","Smoky aromas on a wine that is curiously lacking in flavor. It is soft, light, missing acidity, just hinting at pear fruits. Boring could be a word.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",97503
"37393","Though it's 100% Chardonnay, this wine doesn't taste particularly Chard-like: it has light floral and stone fruit notes more akin to a Riesling. It's a lightweight in the mouth, rounded out by a little creaminess. A decent, economical choice to quaff on a hot day.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",37393
"53976","With high alcohol, this mountain Zin is robust and a little hot, with a pricky pepperiness. But it's awfully good. Really delicious in ripe, briary blackberries, black cherries, licorice, chocolate, anise and tobacco, the flavors sink into the tongue and spread throughout your head. Really defines the powerhouse style of Sierra Foothills Zinfandel.","Red","Zinfandel","US",53976
"70417","This blend of Niellucciu and Grenache brings the two French Mediterranean wine cultures—Corsica and Provence—together. With its structure and dark tannins, it's a dense wine. It has a stalky edge and black currant juiciness, both of which will soften as it ages. Drink from 2019.","Red","Red Blend","France",70417
"40879","This wine bursts from the bottle with rich and appealing fragrances and flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and citrus. Tart and expressive, it seems to gain extra dimensions from fermentation with wild (native) yeasts. It holds a floral character that is most intriguing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",40879
"32051","This is a rich, full-bodied and generous wine. It has great red berry flavors that are supported by a light oak character and freshened with acidity. Although young, it is ready to drink.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Portugal",32051
"61646","No specific blend is listed on this delicious wine—in the past it's been Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Sémillon. Luscious, ripe fruit flavors of grapefruit, melon and loads of fresh pear combine to show a wonderfully fresh and tasty white wine. The acids lift up the brightness, and this round and fruity style is a can't miss proposition.","White","White Blend","US",61646
"43593","The latest release of the legendary Comtes de Champagne comes from a great vintage. It has full, toasty bottle-age notes that give the wine depth of flavor, with a ripe, rounded mouthfeel and taut acidity. An almond note combines with the citrus-driven acidity on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",43593
"55790","A good Cabernet, rough and tannic, with blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors that finish a bit sweet and syrupy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55790
"78427","Aromas of graphite, subtle oak and ripe woodland berries carry over to the palate, along with notes of vanilla and espresso. It has an almost sugary-sweet finish. It's already extremely accessible so drink now.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",78427
"7160","Shows the classic structure of a fine Russian River Pinot, and Merry Edwards' way of making everything elegant. Dry and crisp, the wine displays cherry pulp and skin, cola, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into ultra-refined, velvety tannins. Doesn't seem to have the fruity focus and concentration of recent vintages, though, so drink soon.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7160
"36742","This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc showcases pure flavors of lemon, lime and green melon. The acidity is brisk, providing brightness. A touch of sugary sweetness on the finish should make it pair nicely with Asian fare.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",36742
"79299","This is pure and intense with layers of limes, kiwis, apricots, oranges, pineapples and golden mangoes. Only neutral oak was used, providing background hints of buttered toast. The winemaker did not put the wine through malolactic fermentation, resulting in wonderfully bright acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",79299
"47233","Produced from organically grown grapes, this wine has attractive red fruits and a warm ripe character. Dominated by Grenache, it has a light peppery edge as well as plenty of bright acidity to contrast the fruitiness. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",47233
"38057","With some Pinot Blanc blended in for richness, this wine has a honeyed edge to the lemon, pineapple and pear fruit flavors. It's crisp with Monterey acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",38057
"42124","This wine was aged for 30 months in new French oak before subsequently seeing time in bottle. It offers aromas and flavors of herbs, woodspice and red and black fruit, with firm tannins providing the frame.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42124
"93653","This medium-bodied wine has bold aromas of black pepper, tobacco and clove that merge with straightforward cherry and herb flavors for a nicely complex profile. It has way more depth and interest than the price tag would suggest.","Red","Merlot","US",93653
"25046","A simple, fruity Chardonnay, ripe with pear flavors and a lacing of lime. It is round, warm, soft, ready to drink in a few months.","White","Chardonnay","France",25046
"82074","Always at the top of the Chilean Pinot heap is this true, complex wine from Kingston Family. The nose features light raspberry, citrus, oceanic brine and toasty, creamy oak. The palate is lush and rolls across the tongue with ease; ripe fruit in the cherry zone along with cocoa and spice make for fine flavors. Finishes with purity, smooth tannins and herbal twinges.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",82074
"96735","This is dry, crisp and nicely detailed, with a persistent, clean and fresh mouthfeel. Notes of cucumber, salad greens and citrus, notably lime and grapefruit, are underscored with appealing minerality. This remains one of the highlights of Chehalem's expansive portfolio.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",96735
"60604","The nose on this appellation blend is plump and inviting, blending pan-seared Gala apples and browned butter with a more intriguing botanical aroma. There is zip on the tip of the sip, with flavors of lime peel, lemon zest and a nuttiness in the midpalate.","White","Chardonnay","US",60604
"16166","Cherry, berry and sinewy leather make for a memorable experience of fruit and savory accents in this farm-designate that impresses from start to finish. Offering length and breadth, it's balanced despite noticeable ripeness and body.","Red","Zinfandel","US",16166
"66362","A lovely Riesling, made in the German style. It's dryish, low in alcohol, high in racy acidity and tantalizing in flavor, with suggestions of citrus fruits, wildflowers, minerals and a distinct touch of petrol. It's wonderful as an apéritif and fine with Indian and Vietnamese food.","White","Riesling","US",66362
"70553","This unlikely blend of 87% Shiraz and 13% Petit Verdot hits the right notes for a bargain sipper, boasting plenty of weight and an interesting juxtaposition of raspberry fruit with dark chocolate. Earthy notes provide depth, and the finish is surprisingly silky for a wine in this price range. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",70553
"28337","Enticing fragrances suggest alpine wild flower, stone fruit and savory herb. The linear palate is loaded with finesse and character, delivering creamy green apple, tangerine, mineral, white peach and mint. It's well balanced with bright acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",28337
"55939","Though light in color and body, this wine carries tremendous aromas and flavors, thanks in part to its 5% cofermented Viognier. The nose shows charred beef, crushed elderberry and potpourri scents, while the palate shows tart red currant and cranberry fruit, with smoked beef, white, pepper, rosemary and fennel accents.","Red","Syrah","US",55939
"8880","Obtuse, unfocused aromas of squash, carrot and citrus are not as zesty and direct as Verdejo should be. This feels wide, with spritz to the palate. No single fruit flavor stands out in front of a soft finish with mild apple and stone-fruit notes.","White","Verdejo","Spain",8880
"74839","This ripe, pineapple- and peach-flavored wine has a soft texture, hints of vanilla and light acidity. It is rounded, full in the mouth and with a light textured aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",74839
"53626","A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard. Give it plenty of decanting (two or three hours) to help it open up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53626
"58333","This is a rich and perfumed wine that is solid with dusty tannins and ripe fruit. Bold acidity adds balance and promises good aging. It is quite dry with fruit hiding behind all the structure, but it will soften, so drink from 2016.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",58333
"12505","Named for an apple variety once common to the area, this vineyard sits outside the town of Graton in Green Valley and was developed in 2007. Elegant and weighty, it shows a youthful tightness of tannin and oak, its savory twists of black tea, blackberry and rhubarb compote chomping at the bit to be enjoyed. The acidity is mouthwatering.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12505
"40030","One of the more controlled, tighter Viogniers out there, without showing the variety's rich flamboyance. It could be a Pinot Gris, with brisk acidity and a clean, cold, steely mouthfeel, except that the citrus fruits do have rich suggestions of mangoes. Still, it shows tremendous elegance and will be delicious in many settings.","White","Viognier","US",40030
"53339","Peppery and tasting of freshly picked blackberries, Haraszthy's old-vine Lodi Zinfandel has a gamy, austere, dusty quality, and is more restrained than in some years past. Pair with anything grilled.","Red","Zinfandel","US",53339
"58490","A terrific value, Borlais's white is subtle and floral on the nose, then full bodied, broad and weighty on the palate, with flavors of melon, pineapple and a dry, stony note that lingers on the finish. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",58490
"7188","Fortified Tannat certainly has tannins, but it lends itself well to this sweet style. It's rich, obviously ageworthy with ripe black fruits and concentrated sweetness that's balanced by acidity. It should be aged until 2018.","Red","Tannat","France",7188
"68143","Winemaker John Benedetti relies on a single clone usually used for sparkling wine in this bottling from a 25-year-old dry-farmed vineyard at 1,700 feet. Aromas of buttered cherries, rhubarb, red flowers, cinnamon and milk chocolate give way to a palate that shows lots of slate and graphite as well as dried cherry, eucalyptus, dried mint and a touch of leathery gaminess.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68143
"85209","Crisp with peach and apricot goodness, this full-bodied white's gravelly texture works to its advantage, providing both steely acidity and grip. That grit becomes velvety smooth as the wine opens in the glass, making it irresistibly seductive and inviting.","White","Chardonnay","US",85209
"54009","Crisp and tight, this is a steely, mineral-driven wine. The texture is taut and nervy, lively with acidity and just hinting at a more creamy future. The toasty edge is attractive and fills the wine. Drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",54009
"74248","This bright, juicy red offers rose, dark berry, baking spice and new leather scents that mingle together in the glass. On the palate, crushed raspberry, wild cherry, licorice and clove notes are bolstered by chewy tannins and fresh acidity. It's delicious now but will reward a few more years in the cellar.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",74248
"65390","An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mélange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",65390
"88779","A streak of unripe green mint mars this wine. It's almost vegetal, stealing the thunder from the cherry and oak flavors. The tannins and acidity are beautiful, but that asparagus note is disturbing.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88779
"99435","A strong effort, this medium-bodied wine combines hints of nettle leaf with bold fruit flavors of nectarine, pineapple and grapefruit. There's creamy texture and ample concentration on the midpalate, followed by a long, silky finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",99435
"86431","This hearty Primitivo is ripe and  jammy with tones of black cherry preserves and blackberry pie. There are gritty tannins and a chewy feel that gives this wine power and succulence.","Red","Primitivo","Italy",86431
"59786","Winter spices like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg waft from this full-bodied and complex wine, joining gentle black-cherry flavors on the palate. The texture is smooth and caressing, and its richness lingers on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",59786
"64541","From vines close to the medieval castle of Numão in the Douro Superior, this wine represents the top of the range for this family-owned estate. Layers of new wood vie with the ripe fruit of this wine that offers spice as well as black-plum fruits and acidity. It is developing well, giving a rich wine that will be ready to drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",64541
"28773","Ripe, almost candied aromas of berry fruits are offset by creamy oak scents and a touch of olive. This is chunky, weighty and trying hard to keep its form. Flavors of roasted black fruits, chocolate and herbs finish soft and low on structure. Drink this warm-vintage, full-flavored Cab through 2017.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",28773
"80227","A soft wine that hints at the richness of Meursault, with caramel flavors giving weight, and a distinct citrus and apple character giving freshness. For early drinking.","White","Chardonnay","France",80227
"99724","The blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc gives this wine a rich character. It does have a firm edge of tannins still producing a dry character that needs to soften. The juicy black currants are developing well and should balance the tannins in a year or two. Drink this solid wine from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",99724
"72767","Oak dominates this Chard. It's an example of the old criticism, drinking toothpicks. The flavors of buttered toast, caramel, roasted meringue and crème brûlée dominate the pineapple and pear fruit, unbalancing an otherwise excellent wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",72767
"70021","Right up there with last year's bottling, this Grenache Blanc-Sauvignon Blanc blend is unoaked, offering pure flavors of terroir-inspired fruit. High acidity backs up the lemongrass, pineapple, peach and honeysuckle flavors that finish so dry and spicy.","White","White Blend","US",70021
"75423","Black ash, cedar and crushed raspberries are the aromas here, while an underlying note of wet earth keeps things grounded. The palate has a sweet cherry cordial character while the short finish offers up a hit of mixed berry soup. Drink up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",75423
"58886","A very good Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend from Agustin Huneeus. While it would not be true to say it's a second wine of Quintessa, it does show the balance and integrity of that bottling, with a firm structure and dramatically layered black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58886
"76916","Red-berry fruit with a heavy dose of herb and bell pepper marks this red blend. The mouthfeel is smooth, but the acidity is high and the wine finishes slightly tart, with a green note. Another victim of this tough year. (We'll look forward to the 1999.)","Red","Red Blend","Chile",76916
"93012","Bocara is a simple rendition of the Garganega grape that shows easy lines and bright tones of lemon rind, tangerine skin and honeydew melon. There's a fatty, or waxy element to the mouthfeel that is followed by bright acidity.","White","Garganega","Italy",93012
"62888","Some appealing floral highlights rub against flavors of orange crush, cherry soda and toasted cracker. This young wine seems structured for early drinking.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",62888
"44352","Delicately sparkling, this creamy Champagne is crisp, fruity and on the dry side of Brut. It has citrus as well as pear flavors giving a fruity edge to the lively texture. This delicious wine should age a little longer, so drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",44352
"24339","This wine, with its black color, barely escapes being too much. Initially, it seems too rich, too concentrated. But slowly its more elegant character, ripe and smooth, comes through. The acidity gives surprising freshness considering the weight and density. It does need time, so drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",24339
"17934","Taking the idea of its name from Sauternes producers, the second wine from Romaneira is rich, succulent and fruity. There are plenty of tannins, but they are soft, leaving the main flavors to black fruits, toast and spice.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",17934
"97629","A little rustic, with a briary, brambly mouthfeel, but it's a good example of a Sonoma County Zinfandel. The winery says the vines are old, and there are deep, concentrated flavors of wild forest berries, shriveled raisins, licorice, pine tar, grilled beef and black peppers. Because of the roughness, you'll want to give this wine a few hours of decanting.","Red","Zinfandel","US",97629
"70906","Pink and light, with a sharp nose that's sweaty and sour. The palate is quite strong in acidity, so there's razor-like sharpness and spiky flavors of grapefruit and early season red plums. Overly zesty and tart; made from Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot.","Rosé","Rosé","Chile",70906
"53949","A deep purple color, this ripe selection leads with lush aromas of raspberry jam, blueberry and boysenberry, all of which carry through to the fruit-forward palate. Medium tannins and ample acidity provide good framing to the fruity richness, resulting in a crushed velvet texture. Drink now.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",53949
"96857","Amber to the eye, this wine features an enticing bouquet of almond blossom and toffee. It is slightly chalky on the palate, with a sophisticated mélange of baked apple, peach, smoked meat and pencil-lead flavors. A touch of brightness marks the soft finish.","White","White Blend","",96857
"678","Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",678
"91078","There's a feral quality to this wine, with its flavors of wild forest berries, red currants, cola, spicy smoked meats, tangerine zest and sandalwood, and hints of pine cones, rosemary and thyme. It's big and dry and, although silky in the mouth, tannic. An impressive young Pinot Noir that should be cellared for 5–6 years, at least.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91078
"11488","With touches of the typical minerality of the appellation, this is a young, tight wine. Crisp apple, lemon and spice add interest to this perfumed wine. It will be better to drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",11488
"15090","Passion fruit and canned pea aromas are typical of Leyda, especially in a cool year like 2013. This is consistent on the palate, with zesty acidity. Flavors of passion fruit, mango, lime and green herbs finish citrusy and fresh.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",15090
"15927","This has aromas of wood, vanilla and toast. The palate is already evolved and tired, and it lacks the fruit richness to carry off the oak.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",15927
"33762","This is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse.","White","Chardonnay","US",33762
"77445","This elegant wine is all about silky texture and balance. It delivers crushed flower, sour cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and balsamic sensations alongside supple tannins and vibrant acidity. It's already accessible but is still young and promises to blossom into a Barolo with complexity and depth. Drink 2020–2040.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",77445
"28471","Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016.","White","Chardonnay","US",28471
"68620","Drawn from Craggy's extensive holdings in Martinborough, this is a food-friendly Sauvignon Blanc. It doesn't push the herbal extremes of the variety but instead offers plenty of zesty citrus fruit tinged with snow pea, medium body and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink it over the next year or so.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",68620
"72561","The thing to know about this wine is it's a little sweet and also a little soft. The flavors are lovely, suggesting apricots, peaches, Meyer lemons and honeysuckle flowers.","White","Chenin Blanc","US",72561
"17230","This Salta Cabernet is closed on the nose, green and smelling like cigar ash. Hard, green tannins and astringency create a tough environment for stewy flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",17230
"48868","Subtle apricot and herb aromas, then juicy apple and apricot flavors characterize this straw-colored, sturdy wine. It is crisp and dry, with enough body to keep the texture smooth and the whole taste experience balanced.","White","Albariño","US",48868
"24884","Heady aromas of honeysuckle, orange blossom and yellow stone fruit lead the nose on this lightly sparkling dessert wine. The bright palate offers yellow peach, apricot and candied citrus zest alongside a foaming mousse.","White","Moscato","Italy",24884
"30103","A soft and spicy wine that has firm tannins and ample plum fruit notes. Balanced acidity gives this accessible wine a sense of freshness as well as weight. Drink now.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",30103
"68998","Concentrated aromas of ocean brine, sweat and citrus fruits feed into a juicy, minerally palate. Green, tangy flavors of tangerine and canned beans end long, minerally and fresh, with lasting acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",68998
"72992","This wine leads with new leather, dark spice, iris and eucalyptus scents. Its linear, slender palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and ground clove—flavors that are held taut by fine-grained tannins and racy acidity.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",72992
"57475","A drop of Petite Sirah gives this wine a color and tannin boost. The flavors are enormously ripe, brimming with blackberries, cassis, grilled beef and oak notes that go on into a long, spicy finish. The wine shows the classy structure of Napa Zin, and is ready to drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",57475
"86524","Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 95% of the blend, along with 5% Merlot. Sourced from the Beckstoffer Georges III vineyard, this wine shows the enormous ripeness and softness that vineyard is known for, with rich, opulent black cherry jam and mocha flavors, balanced by acidity and tannins. There's a lot of new oak. Drink now–2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",86524
"95164","This is a rich and toasty Chard with notes of wood-grilled peaches, soft Cortland apple flesh and vanilla cream. The finish is long and the mouth round without being flabby or overdone.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",95164
"43980","Made light and bright, this wine combines 56% Viognier with 22% Roussanne and 22% Marsanne. The three varieties are fermented in stainless steel to preserve the lean linear characteristics of lemon and lime that wrap around crisp tight acidity, the entirety buoyant in floral honeysuckle.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",43980
"36906","An unusual wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot. It's floral but underdeveloped, with volatility and stunted fruit. The palate has punch and size but also saucy, herbal flavors and a leathery, salinic finish. Shows flashes but it doesn't dance in the mouth.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",36906
"93328","The producer's flagship wine, this is sourced from several Green Valley sites, including Amber Ridge and Manna. Both contribute a full-bodied wealth of packed-earth flavor in a generously layered, rich explosion of dark cherry, plum and pomegranate. Along the way, streaks of citrus and black tea provide exotic interludes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93328
"493","It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance.","Red","Grenache","US",493
"103139","It's almost two-thirds Riesling, which gives the wine its tight focus and strong mineral and citrus overtones, but there's also Sauvignon Blanc, Marsanne, Viognier and Chardonnay in the mix, giving it layers of fruity complexity. Awfully good for the price.","White","White Blend","Australia",103139
"99800","Light strawberry, leather and tomato leaf aromas all come together to form a true, traditional crianza bouquet. The palate is also in that vein, showing apple skin, red plum and strawberry flavors. With a hint of butter and drying tannins coming on late, this fits squarely into the mold of traditional Rioja crianza.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",99800
"71387","While soft on entry with slightly pulpy, sweet plum flavors, this Cab Franc gains intensity on the midpalate as spicy bramble notes and soft tannins accumulate. Approachable in style, it's a pleasant everyday red with just a hint of leafy green on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",71387
"60357","This is a purely varietal, estate-grown wine from Mount George, cave-aged for nearly two years in all-new French oak. Generously expansive on the palate, it offers full-bodied richness around a thoughtful layering of clove, juicy black cherry and savory red currant, lingering on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60357
"45937","This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Cold Creek vineyard. Smooth and fruit forward, it's done in a seamless, accessible, ready-to-drink style that makes it difficult to put down. A fair amount of vanilla flavor comes through, accenting a consumer (and consumption) friendly style.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45937
"30817","A very nice Cabernet, with a rich vein of tannins that gives it a crunchy texture, and forward black currant, cherry, and plum flavors that are as juicy as they come. Nearly 100% varietal Cab, it feels upscale and plush in the mouth, and gets better as it warms in the glass. Fair price for a Cab this good.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",30817
"99500","There's an abundance of crisp black cherry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon, but hints of green leaves and wet soil lend a dark, elegant tone. Quite supple and full on the palate, it finishes long with staunch, grippy tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99500
"24989","Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",24989
"44310","A wine of medium weight and alcohol that tastes bigger on the palate due to the tannins. There's dullness to the fruit, which shows blackberry and cherry amidst a trace of clove before a hint of greenness on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44310
"98627","Lightly toasted almond, melted butter, chalk and Meyer lemon scents are delicately woven together in this expressive yet restrained bottling. There is well dispersed acidic energy throughout the palate, where smoked lemon flavors lead into sea salt and white flower notes on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",98627
"17830","There's a tawny edge to this wine, suggesting that it's quickly maturing and should be consumed soon. That said, it's drinking very well, with a slightly roasted, nutty character over soft strawberry/cherry fruit. Hints of pine needle and cured meat add further flavor interest.","Red","Tempranillo","US",17830
"64962","With vineyards south of the Michelin tire city of Clermont-Ferrand, this producer is on the edge of the volcanoes of the Puy de Dôme. The wine, lightly fruity with fresh wild-berry flavors, is soft and fruity, ready to drink young. Just wait until early 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",64962
"39452","A dry Gewürztraminer, more fruity than many, showing intense spice and pepper as well as sultana and pear flavors. It has concentration, a dense texture, and delicious perfumes.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",39452
"59474","This wine is firmly tannic and dry. It has ripe fruits and these should develop well. With its structure and fruitiness, it will become a generous, full wine from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",59474
"39796","Lots of rich, heady flavors in this delicious young Cabernet Sauvignon. It appeals now for the intense blackberry, cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and anise flavors, but such is the tannic intensity that it should easily age. Hold until 2015 and try again.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",39796
"52086","On the plus side, this is a well-ripened, full-bodied wine, with a mix of pear and citrus. It's lightly spicy and drinking at its peak, broad and just a little flat on the palate.","White","Pinot Gris","US",52086
"48621","This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",48621
"35189","This is a substantial, complete and well-balanced wine with a deep red color and brickish rim. Intensely fruity and spicy aromas incorporate elegant oak nuances, black cherries, nutmeg and cinnamon, leading to generous, ripe flavors and a smooth, velvety texture. It's quite complex and delicious.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35189
"95437","Ripe, delicious flavors of tropical fruit, butterscotch, honey and spice compose this flashy Viognier. It's a bit high in alcohol, with a chili pepper singe on the finish.","White","Viognier","US",95437
"53108","Dark and brooding, this has inky concentration, power and determination. The nose is alive with tones of blackberry, maraschino, leather, tobacco and rusty soil. The mouthfeel is thick and penetrating.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",53108
"63060","This is always a major wine, and this vintage is no exception. It is spectacularly ripe, spicy, concentrated and fruity. The yellow fruits, tangy citrus and mineral structure all contribute to an intense complexity. Age this wine for many years and don't drink before 2017.","White","Riesling","Austria",63060
"41865","Apple and citrus scents mark the nose, and then the wine adds mineral notes of crushed vitamins on the palate. It's plump and medium in body, with a crisp, citrusy-minerally finish that would go well alongside Asian dishes without too much sweetness or spice.","White","Riesling","Germany",41865
"11282","Tangy, citrusy aromas suggest sour plum and cranberry. In the mouth, this is shearing and high in acid, with sharp, tart flavors of currant and plum that finish with a distant hint of spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",11282
"94337","Appealing aromas of coffee, cherry, vanilla, woodspice, mesquite and herbs lead to concentrated, rich cherry and chocolate flavors that linger. It's drinking well now but also should have a long life ahead of it in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",94337
"8296","Soft with cranberry and red currant accents, this fairly priced wine is subtle in tannin and oak, with a core of succulent black cherry and clove flavor. Approachable and round on the palate, it's a good choice for big gatherings.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8296
"96582","One of a pair of wines that comes from specific soil types. This impressive wine, from granite soil, is strongly mineral while also having some great fruit. Apples, pears and green plums all make their presence felt in this wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2018.","White","Melon","France",96582
"68193","Full bodied and gritty in texture, this wine smooths out in the glass, opening to slowly unravel layers of forest pine, black cherry and cola. With measured oak, it has a depth and breadth across the palate, revealing concentration within a graceful context.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68193
"22472","Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.","Red","Petit Verdot","Spain",22472
"36993","Shows the edgy tannins that Dry Creek red wines invariably display, with a sandpapery texture. That makes the wine, which is a Bordeaux blend of five varieties, a little rustic. But the dryness and bite are a nice alternative to the riper, softer Napa style, and more versatile at the table. Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",36993
"27414","Lush aromas of melon, mango and pineapple are pristine and primary on this delicate, brisk Riesling. Off dry in style, it's a straightforward yet irresistibly juicy thirst quencher sure to please a wide audience.","White","Riesling","US",27414
"38220","A surprisingly mature-colored wine, with flavors that are of herbs, dark tannins as well as more juicy beets and dark black cherries. There is firm concentration, but the wine should be drunk now.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",38220
"8128","Pure Pinot Noir from the south of Beaujolais, this is soft, fruity and with attractive acidity. Red fruits and a crisp acidity give this wine its bright character. Ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",8128
"16633","This wine checks all the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc boxes. It's medium in weight and ably marries some green, leafy character with white grapefruit notes. The lasting impression is of an herbal grapefruit sorbet that leaves behind a clean, refreshed palate.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",16633
"55527","A good value in Oregon Pinot, this wine features fully ripe cherry aromas with some chocolaty overtones allied to a smoked-meat note. The fruit really sings on the palate, where some cranberry and cocoa flavors chime in. Best Buy.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55527
"47418","The tannins of the Zweigelt show through the rich texture of this wine, giving a fascinating balance between smoothness and a dry, firm, smoky core. Even at six years, it does need more aging to round out even more and bring out the natural honey flavors.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",47418
"93543","From the Apalta Vineyard in Colchagua, this robust, fruity Merlot is rich and sweet, and offers a fine mesh of blueberry and black raspberry fruit. The wine is warm and friendly, and overall it's quite easy to drink. The structure is there and so is the flavor and foundation. And it improves with airing, always a good sign of quality.","Red","Merlot","Chile",93543
"19474","The richness of the aroma belies the elegance of this outstanding Pinot Noir. Tightly woven scents of sweet herb, tobacco, clove, forest floor fungus and spicy red fruits provide an introduction to a wine that can only be called svelte. It's as smooth as silk in the mouth, loaded with flavor and polished to a warm glow, which is exactly what it leaves you with after just one sip.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19474
"63817","A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean. The palate offers prune, dried cherry, black pepper, graphite and espresso alongside dusty tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",63817
"87211","Generous and ripe, this is a wine that is finely balanced and very ready to drink. Ripe tannins, soft texture and final acidity make for an easy-drinking wine.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",87211
"78043","Quite light and restrained on the nose, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows pithy Key lime and scratched grapefruit-skin aromas. There is a decent sizzle of acidity to the palate, with lime rinds, pith and juice playing together. Touches of almond and flint add interest.","White","Chardonnay","US",78043
"48487","This brut offers notes of citrus, stone fruit and Mediterranean herbs. It's fresh and linear, with an elegant perlage. The quenching finish closes on a note of bitter walnut.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",48487
"5634","Soft yet perky strawberry aromas meet licorice, fennel bulb and cinnamon on the nose of this well balanced Zinfandel from a historic vineyard. There is a strong garrigue edge to the palate and a touch of roasted meat, giving depth to the bright and candied red fruit. Great with barbecue.","Red","Zinfandel","US",5634
"66174","This Barolo shows ripe black cherry and plum aromas with spice undertones. The concentrated palate shows dark cherry, white pepper, mint and menthol. It has a delicious creamy texture and big, brooding tannins. While this will evolve nicely for the next few years, it's a tad shy on acidity so don't lay it down for ages.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",66174
"16400","Jammy, somewhat green aromas are suggestive of tomato sauce with oregano and thyme. This feels full, creamy and thick, with earthy, herbal berry flavors that finish with creamy weight and chewy tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",16400
"31549","When Donatella Colombini left the family estate of Fattoria dei Barbi, she set up her own production network at Fattoria del Casato. Here she has made an elegant 1997 Brunello, brimming with black tar and cherries, and balanced ripe, sweet tannins and acidity. While it is not powerful, it is smooth, ripe and seductive.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",31549
"51694","From the Château d'Aulnaye vineyard that is part of the Thébaud estate, this wine is still tight and textured, with a strong mineral element as well as crisp green fruits. It is rich with a touch of vanilla smoothing things out. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",51694
"1011","Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1011
"51935","This is a big, meaty wine that wears its youthfulness on its sleeve, showing a touch of reduction and assertive oak. Beneath its wall of ripeness, black licorice, cherry and pomegranate characteristics are buoyed by a depth of thick tannin.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51935
"90977","The little subregion of Te Tuna Road, set apart from the vines in and around the village of Martinborough itself, is home to several fine vineyards. This is medium to full in body, with flavors of black cherry, menthol and toast, silky tannins and a long finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",90977
"28873","Earthy aromas lead to a wine that is at a stage of development that suppresses fruit. The wood aging and the extracted structure are still strong. Hints of juicy black fruits emerge, promising a good, if tannic future. Wait until 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",28873
"75321","Drinkable and very generic in taste, this medium bodied wine has little varietal character and a broad, soft texture.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",75321
"38593","Pineapple appears first on the nose and palate, followed by high-toned acidity and a back-up of lemon and lime. Medium bodied, the wine remains light and crisp throughout, finishing in a swirl of lemon zest and grapefruit pith.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",38593
"43538","Produced from vines close to the chateau of Santenay, this is a tight, mineral wine. It has intense crisp acidity, tangy citrus and excellent potential. The fruit is asking for time to fill out, so drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",43538
"87676","Immaculately clean and fresh, this enters the mouth with a pleasing lightness, displaying a mix of stone fruits and a streak of vanilla wafer running right through its core. It opens in the glass, adding muscle and depth, ultimately developing into a complex and persistent wine that simply refuses to quit.","White","Chardonnay","US",87676
"45145","This presents the nose whiffs of pineapple and wet stone while the lean palate offers rennet apple skin, tangerine and a hint of mineral. Bracing acidity dominates the finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",45145
"106494","Stony citrus aromas blend with green notes and lees-based vanilla. This is lean and citrusy on the tongue, with nectarine, citrus and green-herb flavors. A zesty finish is a bit shallow, but overall this fresh wine is easy to like.","White","Verdejo","Spain",106494
"95690","Forest floor, chopped herb, iris and red berry aromas lead the nose on this medium-bodied red. On the smooth silky palate, notes of star anise and white pepper accent juicy red berry alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",95690
"35377","The aromas bring notes of vanilla, cream and baking spice, with the oak playing a prominent part but still showing appeal. The palate brings sweet cinnamon flavors that linger on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",35377
"24521","Lightly herbal aromas of black currant, tobacco, minerals and latent char provide for a fine opening. Given that this is now 14+ years old, its core structure and acidity level are excellent. Rooty flavors of licorice and black currant show toast and chocolate accents, while the finish is dry, spicy and whole. This is living proof that top Chilean Cabernets from exceptional vintages can age for up to two decades; drink through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",24521
"49189","Greg Bjornstad brings his deft touch to this lovely wine. Hard to imagine a better restaurant Pinot for the wine list, with food-friendly bright acidity. It's light and silky, brisk in acidity, and compellingly rich. The raspberry and cherry fruit has earthy notes of mushrooms, giving the wine great complexity. Good as it is now, it will easily develop bottle notes over the next 5–6 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49189
"80789","The winery's Affinity bottling has had mixed results over the years, but this is one of their best, right up there with the 2007. It's a beautiful wine, absolutely dry, tannic, smooth and complex in black currant flavor. A bright streak of acidity provides wonderful balance, and should help the wine to age through at least 2019.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80789
"43464","This stylish white offers delicate peach and lemon aromas and a combination of zippy citrus and warming spice on the palate. Approachable but complex, the wine offers power and grace.","White","Viognier","South Africa",43464
"41042","Sumptuous, ripe and very full on the palate, this wine is dense and packed with notes of botrytis that give a strong sense of structure. This well-balanced wine shows potential to age, offering rich acacia honey and beautiful final acidity. Drink from 2020.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",41042
"73361","This lightweight, silky-textured wine features scents of strawberries, tomatoes and campfire smoke. Those same elements appear on the palate, ending without much tannin. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",73361
"34171","Oak, espresso and toast aromas jump out of the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers plum cake, roasted coffee bean, oak extract, licorice, a confectionary note and licorice but not much fruit richness. Raspy wood tannins provide the framework.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",34171
"90317","There's a drily tannic texture that gives this very ripe Cab structure and balance. Thoroughly dry, it tastes of red and black currants, smoky oak and peppery, dusty Asian spices. Gets better and better as it unfolds in the glass.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90317
"90256","Opening with aromas of fresh and dried herbs, this wine follows with notes of blackberry, flowers, and black currant, with smoked meat and black olives providing undertones. The black fruit flavors don't hold back, packing a powerful punch.","Red","Syrah","US",90256
"44728","Ser Gioveto (Sangiovese with some Cabernet and Merlot) delivers thick notes of fruit, herbs and earth and has a textured nose and great depth and dimension. The wine's structure is thick and solid and those fresh fruit flavors last a long time on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",44728
"59763","Lemon, blossoms and a slight kerosene nose lead into a prickly, slippery texture, with lemon-lime and wet stone flavors. A classic example of Clare Valley Riesling.","White","Riesling","Australia",59763
"4696","20% whole-cluster fermented, this rich, brooding blend of Alder Ridge (86%) and Snipes Mountain Grenache brings notes of licorice, dark cherry, black pepper and mortared herbs. It's broad in feel, tart, fruit filled, and tightly wound, needing time in the cellar to unfurl.","Red","Grenache","US",4696
"2090","Only very slight citrus notes appear on the nose. The palate opens into soft fruitiness with slight hints of apricot and peach. The chief attraction, though, is a central, vivid theme of white pepper. This is light bodied but full of subtle charms.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",2090
"51100","Gherardino offers tight fruit nuances of forest berry, white cherry and cranberry, wrapped within generous tones of almond, wet earth and blue flower. It's an easy-drinking Sangiovese, with bright acids on the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",51100
"10694","Aromas of tire rubber mix with plum and berry on a rustic nose. This wine displays a strong grip but also shearing tartaric acidity. Smoky plum and berry flavors suggest char and hickory, finishing spicy and savory. Drink through 2020","Red","Malbec","Argentina",10694
"78132","While this smells plump, mealy and soft, it's decidedly acidic and citrusy in the mouth. In terms of feel, it's limited and monotone, while the flavors run toward vanilla, orange and oak. The finish is fleeting finish and light on flavor.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",78132
"46057","Dark pink in color, this wine offers a pleasing brightness of strawberry and grapefruit, with moderate acidity that retains body and texture. It finishes ripely succulent.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46057
"104970","The smell of tart green apple frying in butter introduces this bottling from Dan Lee's historic winery. On the palate, lemon-lime spritzer and pear flow into a saline minerality in the midpalate, with acidic tartness emerging on the finish. This is a very tight and focused Chardonnay.","White","Chardonnay","US",104970
"83409","This is a wonderful Pinot Noir to drink now for its dry crispness, silky elegance, and pleasant cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper  and teriyaki beef flavors. Polished and supple, and easy to find, with nearly 38,000 cases produced.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83409
"41885","Soft and fruity, a mix of apples and peaches, with a hint of toasted cracker. A simple, light Sauv Blanc that is smooth and easy-drinking.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",41885
"61266","This is an expertly extracted and penetrating Sangiovese-based wine (with a small percentage of other grapes mixed in) that boasts an absolutely irresistible nose. It is generous and full, sweet and succulent and will definitely please now or in 10 years. Black cherries and chocolate are the main themes, with coffee and chewy tannins in the mouth: An exciting discovery from a relatively unknown estate.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",61266
"96351","This late harvest selection boasts ripe apricot, lychee, golden raisin, honeydew and baked apple fruit characters alongside glimmers of sweet spice, candied orange rind and raw honeycomb. It's full and deliciously weighty in the mouth, with a stunning ginger-infused lift to the long close.","White","Gewürztraminer","Israel",96351
"83008","Pristine white peach mingles with saffron, candle wax and dusty minerals in this enticingly spry wine, but the shriekingly high acidity cuts the palate with a razor's edge. Welcome touches of honey add some balance towards the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",83008
"95929","Powdery and oaky smelling, with not much fruit to get excited about. Feels soft and mushy, with banana, pear and resiny vanilla flavors. Feels resiny on the finish, too.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",95929
"52634","Frank Family is one of those wineries that Cab lovers should know more about. This, their basic Napa Cab, is a solid hit, tannic, dry and balanced. It shows classic flavors of black currants, with contributing notes of chocolate, anise and cedar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52634
"42238","This is richly oaked, which may turn off some northern Rhône purists, but the underlying fruit is superb, with the toast, cedar and vanilla notes amply supported by black cherry fruit. The texture is velvety, leaving the flavors to linger softly on the finish.","Red","Syrah","France",42238
"96094","One sip is all it takes to understand that this is a vital, impressive and possibly profound wine. A blend of 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, it displays the voluptuous richness of a Heidi Barrett wine, but also shows a firmness of character and a structural dryness that elevate it. Exceptionally flavorful in blackberries and cherries, it has tantalizing hints of herbs, olive tapenade and, of course, intensely fine oak. Drink now–2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",96094
"83416","Shows the rich fruit, acidity and silky texture of Calera's spot on Mount Harlan, with cherry, cola and sweet sandalwood flavors. It's not as complex or concentrated as the single-vineyard bottlings, but is a good approximation.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83416
"29173","From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",29173
"9388","This fresh, savory blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Sangiovese offers a bouquet of blue flowers, cedar, wild berry and light cooking spices. The vibrant, focused palate doles out juicy wild cherry, ripe red currants and white pepper alongside silky smooth tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",9388
"29585","Fresh and fruity, it offers a touch of citrus as well as acidity with pear and red apple flavors. The lightest hint of wood rounds the wine out. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",29585
"98505","Not really distinguishable from the winery's regular bottling of Sangiovese, this too has just a hint of sour cherry, with leafy, earthy, drying tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","US",98505
"71650","Though not one of the producer's single-vineyard bottlings, this estate blend manages to stun the nose and palate nonetheless. Tart mulberry, Kalamata olive, hibiscus, rose hips, red plum and sandalwood aromas wrestle attention immediately, then the sip delivers bergamot, cedar ash, exotic cranberry and rosemary depth. It delivers an excellent combination of wood, fruit and herb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71650
"96655","Winemaker Laurent Montalieu has outdone himself with the fruit from this heritage vineyard. Silky and deep, with a luscious mix of berries, it's a supple, seductive Pinot, wrapped in sleek layers of spicy, toasty oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96655
"95047","This intriguing mix of cedar and cassis, with meatier elements of black licorice, sings in the glass, remaining restrained and elegant despite a full-bodied ripeness and cradling of French oak. Priced below many wines of similar provenance and quality, it's age-worthy, too. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95047
"105423","Blanketed with heavy, minty, candied oak, this Malbec-led blend is meaty, sulfuric, pasty and gaseous on the nose. Plump, oaky and sticky on the palate, with vanilla and candied blueberry and black-plum flavors, this is more fat and oaky than structured and defined.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",105423
"10654","This opens with rustic aromas of barnyard, wet animal fur, game and overripe black fruit. The overripe quality carries over the palate along with notes of bacon, rubber and fleshy blackberry. It finishes on an unpleasantly bitter note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",10654
"71632","Deep in color, big in flavor and full bodied, this is a rustic, straightforward wine. It smells like very ripe blackberry and black cherry, tastes dense and feels full, tannic and firm-textured.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71632
"27676","Viu's first Sauvignon from coastal Leyda is more neutral than desirable. But as it opens you get tangy and fresh flavors of citrus, tropical fruit and grass. It's racy and lively, but the depth and complexity seem regular and not reflective of the reserve notation. Imported by Baystate Wine Co.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",27676
"89609","A compelling effort, stylish and dark, this has a crisp minerality that underpins fruit flavors of black cherry, fig and plum. The texture, length and definition are first-rate.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",89609
"101686","There is not just a notion of ripeness but almost of overripeness of pear fruit on the nose, accompanied by hints of honeysuckle. There also are hints of sandalwood and gentle vanilla. The palate is cushioned with mellow residual sweetness, making the rich flavors even more rich and generous. A vein of citrus freshness counters this, but this is in the generous, medium-sweet spectrum, oozing fruit and generosity. The finish, nonetheless, is precise and fresh. A great example of mature Pinot Gris.","White","Pinot Gris","France",101686
"78403","This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, chopped sage, wild berry and a whiff of leather. On the full-bodied palate, notes of cinnamon and licorice add depth to dark cherry and raspberry compote while a tannic backbone lends structure. Drink 2021–2028.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",78403
"35161","Sonoma Chard costing far more, this one showed off really well. Not as powerful in fruit, but dry and smooth, with delightful pineapple, crème brûlée, peaches and cream, and caramelized oak aromas and flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",35161
"3471","Aromas of exotic spice, game, cherry and medicine cabinet lead to plush fruit and savory flavors. The overt gaminess seems distracting, with the flavors tapering off toward the finish.","Red","Malbec","US",3471
"24566","Acidity dominates this Pinot, giving it a tingly scour. While it's silky and dry, the cherry fruit is a little slender.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",24566
"13837","Situated outside Listrac, this estate has produced a soft, unfocused wine. It has tannins and gentle fruitiness and acidity. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",13837
"56527","A gorgeous Corbières with beautiful expression of the terroir thanks to prominent notes of wild berries and animal laced with accents of garrigue herbs and spice. A hint of cocoa dusts the firmly structured mouth, the palate brimming with flavors of boysenberry and mulberry. Tobacco leaf and licorice root remain on the close.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",56527
"33631","Peter Zemmer produces an enjoyable and pristine expression of Pinot Grigio that really hones in on the freshness and simplicity of the grape. The finish is marked by tones of citrus, pear and white peach.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",33631
"3865","Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality. Dried strawberries, black cherries and plums show on the palate, enhanced by a toasted clove, graphite, juniper and forest floor mintiness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3865
"21881","This is one of the coolest premier crus, meaning that the wine can often age well. In the warm 2015 vintage, the wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",21881
"56007","Recognizably Pinot with its raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, silky tannins and crisp acidity, and gets the job done. But there's an awkward sweetness of residual sugar and a thick, gluey texture that lacks zest and crispness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56007
"66734","Very dry and fairly tannic, with cassis flavors, this Cab is quite enjoyable now and should hold for a couple of years. It has an elegance and structural balance that bring to mind the pre-cult era of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66734
"85693","Light cranberry aromas meet turned loam, cinnamon and porcini mushroom-like umami touches in this bottling from a famed vineyard in the region. The mouthfeel is full and broad, but it's also lively with tart cranberry and raspberry fruit, earthy spice and a touch of raw beef rusticity","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85693
"69829","Cabernet Sauvignon is blessed with 9% Merlot, coming together in a seamlessly rich wine intense in dark chocolate, coconut and vanilla. Soft, the tannins are integrated and the juiciness of the fruit concentrated, finishing with more of that rich taste of chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",69829
"59041","As the blend of 75% Chardonnay, 15% Viognier and 10% Sauvignon Blanc would suggest, this wine combines toasty complexity, fragrant curviness and clean acidity all in one. Overall, it's a more robust white that could handle richer dishes and as a solo sip, is substantial but not heavy. A good white for winter or summer enjoyment.","White","White Blend","US",59041
"78456","Ripe aromas of peach, nectarine and yellow pear meet with a hint of flint on the nose of this exuberant, well-priced and appealing bottling. Stone-fruit flavors show on the palate, with apple, pear and ripe lemon touches cut by dried grass. It's easy to quaff on a warm day.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",78456
"70416","A spearmint aroma give this wine a fresh character. That enhances its berry fruit, spice and perfumed acidity. Drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",70416
"6830","From a dry-farmed vineyard planted more than 50 years ago, this 100% varietal wine is highlighted in compost, leather and graphite. Well structured, with firm, strong tannins, it offers a tartness of pomegranate and black cherry along with a complexity of savory tobacco leaf.","Red","Zinfandel","US",6830
"23926","A fine Chardonnay, front-loaded with tropical fruit, Asian pear, and green apple flavors, with rich honey and vanilla from charred oak barrels. With a crunch of acidity, it's Trefethen's best Chardonnay in years.","White","Chardonnay","US",23926
"88023","Nearly equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also features good handfuls of Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc that offer soft, velvety flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Lightly oaked, the tannins are grippy while the wine generates an herbal undertone on the nose.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",88023
"40427","Ripe orange and plump stone fruits rise from the glass while subtle rose scents hover. The palate is fresh. There is enough acidity and a slightly bitter phenolic edge to frame the peach and orange fruit that is augmented by a little residual sweetness. The finish is off dry. Drink while flavors are fresh.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",40427
"50624","Aromas of wet stone, smoke and petrol seep evocatively into the sweet pineapple bouquet. The palate is dry but deeply concentrated with a ripe stone fruit character. Finishes briskly with a bracing lime juice acidity.","White","Riesling","US",50624
"38281","Kingston's top-level Pinot Noir has been a consistent scorer for the past three vintages. The 2008 starts with pure raspberry and cherry aromas as well as tea accents, while the textbook palate has a proper feel and tasty raspberry and cherry flavors. Spice notes and integrated oak help it achieve its status as one of Chile's truest, most recognizable Pinot Noirs. Drink now through 2011; 300 cases made.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",38281
"20615","This Bordeaux-style blend is bone dry and scented strongly with dried leaves, earth and herbs. The lightly-ripened fruit suggests pomegranate and rhubarb.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",20615
"56571","Aromas of vanilla, butter and barrel spice are followed by lightly styled fruit and barrel flavors. The concentration seems faint.","White","Chardonnay","US",56571
"70953","This straight-shooting Chianti presents loads of red berry fruit and a touch of apple skin, with background shades of pressed violets and moist earth. The wine only sees stainless steel, so the brightness of the fruit is what drives it forward.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",70953
"64870","A bit too pungent for this reviewer, with layers of crushed tomato stalk and leaves holding the edge over more attractive passion-fruit notes. It's light in weight and clean on the finish, so does offer some refreshment value.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",64870
"72755","Made in the méthode Champenoise style from a blend of traditional Georgian grapes, this is a delicately effervescent sparkler with a delicious bouquet of brioche, white flowers and sugar cookies. Pleasantly dry with notes of fresh pears and pineapple, it's an elegant wine with vibrant acidity and a rich minerality throughout.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Georgia",72755
"2402","Subdued aromas recall white flower and stone fruit. The muted palate reveals mature yellow apple skin, lemon zest and notes of nut butter alongside sharp bubbles. It has a tangy but fleeting finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",2402
"13288","Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",13288
"6238","It's too hot for Pinot Noir in Paso Robles, right? This wine shows why. It's not bad, but clumsy, with heavy, earthy flavors. It lacks delicacy and subtlety, which is what Pinot Noir is all about.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6238
"53394","This plump, medium-bodied blend of Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Viognier, Clairette and Bourboulenc features notes reminiscent of ginger, nectarine and melon, then finishes with fresh, zesty citrus. Drink it through mid-2018.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",53394
"72073","Plum, berry and spice aromas are a touch volatile. A hard, flush palate is loaded with rubbery tannins. Baked berry, cassis and prune flavors fall off on a finish that tastes slightly cooked.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",72073
"55370","This is the winery's best Nebula in years. While it's still a little on the soft, sweet side, the cool vintage has resonated in the wine's flavor, giving it a good structure housing cherry, currant and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55370
"105900","Velvety smooth, this estate-driven wine is soft, with a backbone of integrated oak, seasoned in pleasing handfuls of clove and black cherry. Juicy on the palate, and well structured, it finishes brisk in acidity and a note of mocha.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",105900
"54680","There's a very good wine in here, but the winery has released it far too early, which shifts the burden of cellaring to the buyer. Right now it's all primary fruit, acidity and oak. But the fruit is beautifully layered in tiers of roasted blackberries, grilled cherries and cola, and the oak is splendid. This dry, silky wine desperately needs to be held until at least late 2010, and should drink well through 2014.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54680
"61976","Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",61976
"31331","Castello di Bolgheri enjoys some of the most coveted vineyard sites that are located a stone's throw away from the Bolgheri castle tower. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, and it delivers black fruit aromas, backed by wet earth, button mushroom and leather notes. It feels plush, yet structured.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",31331
"128","Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.","White","Riesling","Germany",128
"41349","Light flavors mix citrus and stone fruits, with hints of honey and lemongrass. Just a tad above bone dry, it's finished with 8g/L residual sugar.","White","Riesling","US",41349
"93673","This wine definitely shows a ripe side in its cured meat, tobacco, sandalwood, smoked bacon and old spice. Delivers a rich, plump feel in the mouth, backed by gritty tannins and bright acidity. Despite the cooler vintage, this wine packs power, heat and a tiny touch of sweetness on the close.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",93673
"51839","A négociant effort, this was done entirely in stainless steel and neutral oak. Tart and light, it has simple strawberry fruit with a touch of spice. It offers no tricks, just straight-ahead Pinot at a modest price for Oregon.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51839
"5213","Enticing scents of honeysuckle, jasmine and orchard fruit mingle together while the bone-dry savory palate offers apple, pear and tangerine. An elegant perlage and vibrant acidity lend finesse and freshness while a hint of thyme closes the crisp finish.","White","Glera","Italy",5213

Fruit flavors are concentrated and rich with firm tannins that will benefit from additional time in the bottle. Best after 2017.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77687
"8314","Tight grapefruit flavors, very perfumed and totally dry and crisp, this is a pure-fruited wine, packed with acidity, flavors of white currants and a final zesty minerality. Screwcap.","White","Riesling","France",8314
"105662","Cabernet doesn't get bigger than this. It's an immense wine, explosive in blackberry, black currant, cedar and spice flavors, with immaculate Oakville tannins. Right up there with the best. Refined and exquisite on release, even without decanting, it will easily negotiate many years in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",105662
"8395","Opens with leathery aromas suggestive of animal hide along with a leafy element and nuttiness. Airing reveals a compact, medium-intensity palate with baked, roasted, fairly sweet berry flavors. Finishes sweet and mildly leafy.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",8395
"45932","Aromas of graphite, chocolate, olive, herbs and berry fruits open this cool-climate Syrah. Laser-beam acidity comes on like gangbusters, while those sharp acids create racy, almost tart flavors of currant and huckleberry. The finish is more flashy and racy than generous and tasty, and thus crispness is the defining character of this wine.","Red","Syrah","Chile",45932

"18839","From the home vineyards of the Saget family, this a warm and generous wine. While endowed with many green Sauvignon Blanc characteristics, the tropical fruit style makes it feel rich. As it ages, it will offer even more complex flavors. Drink from 2015.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",18839

A note of bitter almond closes the tangy finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",72205

"78116","Very young, fruity wine. The tannins are already soft and there is stalky black currant acidity that gives the wine a bright freshness. It has no wood and will develop fast.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",78116
"80441","This is a bold, ripe and fruity wine. It has rich black currant fruits, solid tannins and a dense texture. Very aromatic, it is powered by its dry core that is showing signs of softening and rounding out. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",80441
"13243","This shows some of the heat of the 2005 vintage. It is bold and black, with enduring aromas of cherry, prune, leather, spice and licorice. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",13243
"30372","This wine has some structure, with enough tannins to sustain the red-berry fruits. It's juicy, with stalky acidity and an attractive texture that will allow it to age a few months. Drink from early 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",30372
"85597","This is a ripe generous wine that has solid tannins as well as red-plum flavors. It is concentrated and full of flavor. As the tannins soften, it is likely to be ready to drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",85597

"8326","This is Dutton Estate's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc. It did not go through the malolactic fermentation, but it started as very ripe grapes, so what you get is pure citrus, Asian pear, white peach and green apple flavor, zesty and clean in acidity, with slight a sweetness in the finish. Nice with Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese fare.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",8326

"72457","A traditional blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, this medium-bodied rosé offers delicate floral aromas as well as some slightly confected bubble-gum scents. It's less overtly fruity on the palate, then finishes with a welcome burst of lime zest.","Rosé","Rosé","France",72457
"36534","Delicious in flavor, with fresh, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak overlay adds richer layers of sweet caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. A crisp spine of citrusy acidity adds brightness. An appealing Merlot for drinking now.","Red","Merlot","US",36534
"46145","Ripe and full, this is an apricot-and melon-flavored wine. With this ripeness comes a soft texture that offers some warm acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. From 50+-year-old vines, the wine is attractive now and ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",46145
"97045","Zippy acidity balances soft sour-cherry and rustic earth tones on Millbrook's standard-label Pinot Noir. It's an elegantly subdued wine, with soft, gentle tannins and a hint of green herb that linger on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",97045

It's so rich and ripe in citrus and tropical fruits, you won't miss the barrel influence. Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese.","White","Chardonnay","US",2212
"53613","Rough around the edges, this is a dry and tannic wine. It has mint, red currant fruit and a dry center. It needs a year or two, but is likely to remain rustic.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",53613
"20066","A kaleidoscope of sweet, sun-kissed fruit, this dazzling kabinett offers an array of glazed grapefruit, tangerine and stone fruit flavors. It's exceptionally light and airy in texture but penetrates deeply. Spry acidity and a sheen of crushed minerals freshens the midpalate, guiding a clean, citrusy finish. Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its youthful exuberance.","White","Riesling","Germany",20066
"73043","Deliciously rich and extracted in jammy raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, with lots of sweet oak adding vanilla and buttered toast. Could use greater depth, though, as it's a little one-dimensional. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73043
"16424","Sourced from the estate's Bayliss-Bower vineyard, this reserve is a barrel selection that saw a touch more new oak (17%) than the regular bottling. It's tannic and a bit chewy, with lush black cherry fruit. Subtle cola and graphite suggestions add complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",16424
"24993","A soft impression of ripe peach mellows the zesty concentration. The wine is still enigmatic at this point, but will open and reveal more fruit, more ripeness and even more citrus flavors. Enjoy as of 2017.","White","Riesling","Austria",24993

"90259","Starting with the package, this comes in a lovely, graceful, goosenecked bottle.

The length, texture and integration of the barrel and fruit flavors make this extra special.","White","Chardonnay","Canada",90259
"90366","Aged in a mixture of concrete and stainless steel, this wine brings perfumed aromas of crushed stone, flowers and peach. The flavors are mineral laden, broad and silky in feel, showing an impeccable texture and sense of balance. This shows a beautiful sense of freshness.","White","Viognier","US",90366
"41713","This is the winery's first-ever release of a varietal Tempranillo, after using the grapes with Syrah for years in other bottlings.This wine has a softness around a touch of black pepper and dried herb that's inviting, if not a tad generic. The finish is round and lean.","Red","Tempranillo","US",41713
"46499","An intense wine, this is certainly full-bodied, but has fruit weight and concentrated power to match. Beautiful yellow stone fruits—apricots, peaches—are super ripe, their richness allied to sweet acidity, pink grapefruit tones and a smooth, almost oily texture. The one downside is the alcoholic burn that shows through, an unfortunate end to an otherwise spectacular wine.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",46499
"19941","This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",19941
"33017","Grapes for this wine are sourced from a wide selection of sites, from Poe Vineyard in Carneros to Bald Mountain Vineyard on Mount Veeder. Together they sing harmoniously, offering a lightness of color and plenty of perfume around a rich body marked in toffee and supportive oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",33017
"93331","Notes of fresh sourdough rye bread, crisp apples and citrus vie for attention and signal an evolved wine with beautiful notes of long autolysis. This is borne out on the exquisitely pure and fresh palate, still sprightly with lemon and green-apple freshness against a background of bread crust and crumb. Over time, the apple notes mellow and are reminiscent of spiced winter apple. This is marked by exquisite elegance and purity. Without any dosage, this shines with pure, intense and lively fruit.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","France",93331
"76710","The name of this wine refers to the blend of Portuguese grapes with French. Together they give a ripe, now mature and juicy wine. With sweet tannins and black cherry acidity, the wine is smooth, rich with a structure that's well integrated into the fruit. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",76710
"11727","Underbrush, grilled herb, new leather and spiced plum aromas lead the nose of this chewy Brunello. The palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and pipe tobacco notes, framed by robust, fine-grained tannins. Despite the powerful structure and hefty alcohol, it has elegance. Drink 2019–2027.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",11727
"38668","Corte Lenguin's Amarone is less intense aromatically and laid-back in general with measured aromas of ripe fruit, resin, tar and mesquite. It offers more in the mouth however, in terms of density and taste, with a broad texture and bright cherry flavors.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",38668
"47971","A nice, charming Cab, filled with good varietal flavors of ripe blackberries, currants, cherries, red licorice and cedar. Feels a little too soft and one-dimensional for the price.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47971
"17514","With its hint of acidity along with the textured fruit, this is a fruity wine that is balanced between richness and crispness. It has a light tannic structure that gives the wine its shape and ability to age for a few more months before drinking. Drink from mid-2017.","Red","Gamay","France",17514
"80679","This is all about buttered toast, buttered popcorn and orange- and pineapple-soda flavors. Fans of the popular style will love it.","White","Chardonnay","US",80679
"101514","There are extreme amounts of citrus on the nose of this bottling, particularly reminiscent of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, as well as an edgy, crushed slate minerality. The grapefruit character explodes on the sip, which is very refreshing, unique and compelling.","Rosé","Rosé","US",101514
"70142","Here's a robust Zinfandel with ripe, briary flavors and firm tannins that make it especially apt for barbecue. It's forward with blackberry, mulberry, mocha and  spice notes that lead to a long, satisfying finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",70142

"68369","This bold, firm-textured and full-bodied wine still sips easily because of its elegant balance and fine-grained tannins. It smells like sweet oak and red cherries, tastes like ripe black cherries and chocolate, while the texture is mouthfilling but velvety. Those delicious nuances linger on the finish, too.","Red","Red Blend","US",68369
"68925","A significant price drop and a riper vintage make this a fine, every day go-to Pinot Gris. Apple and pear fruit, spiced up with cinnamon highlights, lead into a clean finish. Drink it young.","White","Pinot Gris","US",68925
"29182","This wine shows a more savory side of Cabernet Sauvignon without being in any way underripe or malnourished. It's a big, ripe wine, but the mulberry and cassis fruit is marked by cinnamon and clove shadings. It finishes lush, velvety and warm, with hints of chocolaty richness. This should drink well through at least 2024, and possibly for longer if it firms up a little.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",29182
"84987","This wine is densely packed in ripe red-fruit aromas and flavors, but still expressive in earthy notes of cocoa nib, anise and black tea. Medium tannins and plush berry flavors flesh out the mouthfeel, with a crushed satin texture. The evolving finish seamlessly transitions between ripe, fleshy fruit flavors to cherry skin and finally lightly charred oak and woody spice. Drink now–2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","South Africa",84987

"81291","This is a forceful and powerful wine from a vineyard site in the producer's portfolio since 2005. Broad-shouldered, it offers juicy strawberry and pomegranate expressive of a ripe, picture-perfect vintage. It also manages to retain a pretty, floral characteristic and a depth of dried herb, clove and peppery spice, particularly on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81291
"35218","While the nose is a bit subdued, suggesting bruised apple and herb notes, the palate of this spry, off-dry Riesling is fresh, fruity and elegant. Crisp white peach and grapefruit flavors are lively and tart, finishing with a refreshing green herb note. Drink now through 2018.","White","Riesling","Germany",35218
"54250","This young Chardonnay still shows plenty of yeasty scents and flavors, turning it almost beer-like. Light lemon and tea flavors, with a dash of baking spices, complete the picture.","White","Chardonnay","US",54250
"1525","Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",1525
"76574","One of the producer's signature wines, in a region becoming well-known for the variety, this elegant, herbal-tinged wine does not part with the Napa Valley's imprint of boldness in its length and breadth of rich red fruit, clove, vanilla and toasted oak.","Red","Merlot","US",76574

"27467","A big, black-colored wine, impressively rich. Fermented in open stone lagars, it has an opulent ripe character, the black fruits sweet and generous. At the same time, the dense tannic structure promises good aging. Keep for 5–6 years or more.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",27467
"51510","An immediately attractive wine with intense aromas of black raspberry, cherry and plum laced with toasted cedar and mocha accents. The texture is like crushed velvet, and the rich mouth filled with firm but fine-grain tannins. A touch of cola spice unwinds on the long finish. Drink now–2014.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",51510
"71677","Strong, dusty, stringy herbal notes run right through this wine, contributing to an overall impression of thin not-ripe-enough-for-prime-time fruit. Tart and hard, it's principally cranberries and bitter herbs, with a tannic finish. It helps to give it a lengthy decanting and/or aeration.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71677
"71278","Smoke and bramble on the nose contrast with the kaldeidscope of fresh green melon, stone fruit and citrus flavors in this delicately sweet wine. It's juicy and light-footed, balanced with zesty acidity. The finish lingers on a slightly sugary note.","White","Riesling","Germany",71278

"44226","Prickly pickled aromas are offset by candied fruit notes, while the palate is thin and candied, with nectarine and other less-than-berry flavors. An edgy wine that does little for the image of the obscure Bonarda grape.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",44226
"91075","One of the best wines made on the beautiful island of Sicily, Donnafugata's Mille e Una Notte exhibits gorgeous smoothness in the mouth and exceedingly rich aromas of black currants, chocolate, spice and tobacco. Under all that are notes of toasted almond and pistachio that are characteristic of the Nero d'Avola grape.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",91075
"716","Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",716
"4341","Exotic, complex and vivid aromas, rich and fulfilling fruit flavors and a hefty structure form a great package in this full-bodied and extroverted wine. The winemaker allowed wild yeast and kept 30% whole clusters in the fermentation, then aged it in neutral barrels.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4341
"96895","With more weight than its partner Vie Vité, this is a rich wine, with red plum as well as berry fruits. Almonds, vanilla and a mineral texture all contribute to its natural ripeness. Wait until the end of 2014.","Rosé","Rosé","France",96895

"73701","This is a concentrated wine, full with dry tannins and perfumed red fruits. Hints of the wood aging give the wine toast and smokiness. The fresh fruits form a contrast offering a future of fragrance and stylishness. It needs to age, so wait until 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",73701
"75431","Rough in texture, with jagged tannins and a dry, rasping finish. This blend of the two Cabernets, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah is rustic, with fruity, berry jam, currant and cedar flavors.","Red","Red Blend","US",75431
"94631","A nose with diverse aromas of herbal berry, grilled meat, carob and compost doesn't exhibit clean fruit scents. A grabby palate with rugged tannins hosts hard-edged flavors of plum and leafy berry that dry out on a slightly murky, funky-tasting finish.","Red","Malbec","Chile",94631
"25329","Made with biodynamic and organically-farmed fruit, this cheerful vineyard-designate Prosecco Superiore sports the traditional string closure instead of a sparkling cage and capsule.

"65423","The nose is still closed but the palate reveals yellow mirabelle plum notes enlivened by lemon freshness. This is fruit-driven and refreshing with a slender, easy body that has a dry, lively finish.","White","Riesling","France",65423
"91301","Try giving this Pinot Noir 5–6 years in the cellar. It's not that it's undrinkable now, but it's immature, offering just a hint of what it wants to be. The fruit is ripe and jammy, suggesting red cherries and pomegranates, and the acidity is juicy and tart. Pinots from this vineyard are known to age well.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91301
"102218","Chunky, flat and stemmy on the nose, with herbal, generic fruit aromas. The palate is o.k. but sort of scratchy, while the flavors veer toward herbal, roasted cherry and berry. Herbal and sort of sweet and heavy on the finish. Pretty much what you'd expect for a $10 Cab.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",102218
"79171","Light aromas of red cherry and raspberry can be discovered upon deep nosing, but the fresh garrigue, tree bark and raw cocoa nib notes steal the show. A hint of vanilla-strawberry sweetens up the close. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",79171
"104384","The medium-sweet stone-fruit and orange-peel flavors are direct and bring appeal. It goes down easy.","White","Riesling","US",104384
"101306","Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101306
"13603","Big for a Riesling, this has concentrated, sappy, rich tropical-fruit flavors. The grapes used were sourced from the Lawrence Vineyard on the Royal Slope. It has a fair amount of residual sugar, adding extra richness. Succulent peach, apricot and papaya notes sends lip-licking flavors deep into the finish.","White","Riesling","US",13603
"53716","The odd but endearing Riesling trait of petrol stands out in the aroma of this light-bodied and dry wine, while the flavors are more like apple juice with a touch of honey and earthiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, and a little richness lingers on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",53716
"35266","A nice, easy Syrah made for immediate drinking. It's dry and balanced, with rich flavors of black currants, cherries, cocoa, leather, tobacco and pepper flavors.","Red","Syrah","US",35266
"16737","Aromas of toffee-covered caramel apple, crème brûlée and a touch of petrol combine forcefully to invite one into this otherwise light-bodied, expressive wine, the texture salty and sublime.","White","Chardonnay","US",16737
"50452","This is easy to drink, with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that brightens the lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors. It's slightly sweet, but not overtly so—just enough to pair with Asian-inspired fare.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",50452
"53364","Green beans and grapefruit mark the nose; nectarine, pineapple and beans appear on the palate. At just 12.6% abv, it's reasonably plump and a bit sweet-tasting, making for a slightly disjointed package.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",53364
"90753","A classy Chardonnay for sipping now. Dry and zesty in acidity, it has appealing tangerine, Meyer lemon, white flower, honey and mineral flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",90753
"95558","A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, this presents lovely fragrances of blue flower, incense and tilled soil. On the palate, velvety tannins provide a backbone for juicy blackberry, black cherry and Asian spice. Soft and elegant, this is ready to be enjoyed. Drink through 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",95558
"55656","Aromas of scorched earth, grilled porcini, black plum and a confectionary note lead on this robust red. The hearty palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, toasted oak, anisette, coconut and oak-driven spices alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins carry the warm, ripe flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",55656
"104727","Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam. All that and more can be tasted—the wine is a riot of fruits and baking spices. This makes the best possible case for Mourvèdre as a stand-alone varietal wine here in Washington.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",104727
"74877","This ripe, fruity wine is ready to drink. With red berry fruits and fresh acidity spiced with wood flavors, it's an easy wine that is ripe and soft.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",74877
"25749","Generic berry aromas combined with oak and bath soap scents set up a jammy, soft, chunky palate with baked berry, plum, loam and savory flavors. Licorice, baked berry and an overriding ripeness carry the finish on this ready-to-drink Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",25749
"97141","Ripe, pristine pineapple, mango and honeydew burst from this luscious semi-dry Riesling. It's juicy and lush, boasting a tropical fruit flavor, but also structured and sprightly, with a surprising mineral finish.","White","Riesling","US",97141
"49632","Kendall-Jackson helped define the buttery oaky Chardonnay movement, and this bottling plays that card quite strongly. Oak meets with roasted nuts, sea salt, pecan brittle and Gravenstein apple on the nose. The rounded palate shows sandalwood, candied walnuts and chamomile, though oak is very prominent as well.","White","Chardonnay","US",49632
"91586","Concentrated and dark in color, this wine reveals itself slowly, sharing vibrant layers of raspberry and citrus around burly tannins. It's an all-in-all juicy wine that balances Napa exuberance against a sense of elegance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",91586
"46885","This densely textured wine is ripe with blackberry fruits over firm, smoky tannins. It has a generous feel to it, rich with fruitiness while just moving into a more mature mode. Drink this wine now for its forward fruit, although it will be even better from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",46885
"54251","Dusty mineral notes mingle alongside pretty floral and apple aromas on this softly effervescent sparkling. A blend of 66% Pinot Noir and 34% Chardonnay, it's strikingly high in acidity but has pleasant lemon and apple flavors.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",54251
"20606","From vines that are up to 70 years old, this is a single-parcel wine. It is rich, with some good concentration and a mineral edge. Ripe apricot and apple fruits are combined with a tight acidity that suggests the need to age. Drink from late 2015.","White","Chardonnay","France",20606
"69129","Spicy from the wood aging, this wine is rich, fruity and ready to drink. It has red fruit and acidity along with a smooth texture that gives it an attractive and ripe aftertaste.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",69129
"70488","Its acidity turned up high, this structured Barbera has a savory profile, smooth in woody, toasty flavor, earthy and peppery. Since it's built to age, give it an hour or two in a decanter or open it on subsequent nights to enjoy its evolution.","Red","Barbera","US",70488
"5347","There's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",5347
"18668","Lively and fresh with a floral and lemon citrus character in the nose and on the palate, this full-bodied Gewürtz offers lovely aromas and full-bodied flavors. Dry in style with a clean character. Pair with Indian or Asian cuisine or grilled chicken.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",18668
"88317","Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close.","Rosé","Rosé","France",88317
"16725","This is a concentrated wine, full of blackberry fruits with acidity and spice. The wood-aging character is balancing out well, giving structure without dominating the fruit. Drink from 2020. Grapes are vinified by variety and plot from the 60-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (40%) and Petit Verdot (5%). The property was purchased by Jean-Christophe Mau in 2004.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",16725
"71341","Notes of grass, lime leaf and garrigue herbs lead the bouquet of this attractive wine, supported by fruity tones of white melon, green plum and citrus peel. The medium-weight mouthfeel is countered by ample acidity and pithy flavors that finish slightly astringent. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",71341
"6072","Plenty of smoky, spicy oak on this Chard, along with ripe, orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. It's a little rough around the edges, though. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",6072
"16609","Ripe and crisp in acidity, this 100% Pinot Gris comes from a single vineyard in this highly regarded Santa Barbara County appellation. The wine never saw oak, so the pineapple, apple butter, mango and vanilla flavors come entirely from the grapes.","White","Pinot Gris","US",16609
"3271","Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.","Red","Syrah","Chile",3271
"42266","The chilly vintage has produced a very dry, young wine whose flavors veer toward acid-inspired mineral, citrus peel and apricots, rather than the riper flavors of a warmer year, such as 2008. The result is a tight Chardonnay, one more geared for revealing complexities than for opulence.","White","Chardonnay","US",42266
"38001","Luscious Mirabelle plums and honey melons are tempered by hints of smoke. The slender palate leaves an impression. Assertive but light, it finishes with a long, clean cut.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",38001
"148","This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.","White","Chardonnay","US",148
"5022","This wine is soft, fruity, rounded and red fruit flavored. Soft tannins and black plum skins give the wine a light structure. The wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",5022
"2653","Golden caramelized oak supports a fleshy, full-bodied sensation of pear and fig in this bold, rich wine. Resolved on the palate and possessed of moderate acidity, it finishes in a plume of nutmeg.","White","Chardonnay","US",2653
"13780","The nose here is flat as a board, offering next to nothing. Simple green apple and underripe pear flavors fail to rescue the wine, while a finish lacking definition and length seals its fate. For a producer that largely succeeds with Shiraz, the cute name of this wine is unfortunately the best thing that it has to offer.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",13780
"98923","This wine starts a tad reductive, but that blows off quickly to reveal aromas of seared citrus, pear blossom, apple sorbet and lemon curd. There is zippy acidity on the sip, with intriguing flavors of dried apple, chamomile and lemon syrup, as well as an earthy quality of sandy soil and dried yellow flowers.","White","Chardonnay","US",98923
"43520","Aromas of lemon curd and citrus blossom come with a hint of pine. This feels lemony and narrow, with a tight body that's showing little to no give. Nectarine, citrus and green-melon flavors are fresh prior to a dry citrusy finish.","White","Albariño","Spain",43520
"82714","Reduced aromas provide significant distraction at the outset, with floral and tropical notes fighting to get to the surface. The palate doesn't entirely stay together, as if the wine can't make up its mind which way it wants to go. White grapefruit flavors come through on the finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",82714
"88769","Deep garnet in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberry and roasting meat. It offers a sophisticated mélange of flavors, in particular ripe red cherry, smoke, roasting meat, cranberry and light spice with a hint of brambles. It is very bright on entry, but tannins sneak up and then linger on the gums beyond a smooth finish that is punctuated by a touch of smoke.","Red","Shiraz","India",88769
"45668","Inky, grapy aromas come across hard and reduced. This is pinchy and tannic on the palate, with dark berry, game and crusty flavors. On the finish, it's hard-driving, with heat and tannic grab.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",45668
"42591","From a vineyard that's actually west of the already coastal Sta. Rita Hills, this wine offers rounded red fruits of strawberry, plum and even watermelon on the nose, along with cinnamon and graphite touches. The palate combines cherries, hibiscus, rose petals and tangy cranberry, sailing through herbal touches into a dried mint flavor that carries deep into the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",42591
"92099","The wine is round and full in the mouth. The acidity gives a fresh character to the ripe caramel flavors that shine through the light texture. It is a wine that needs food, with its lively acidity giving a dry, mineral aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",92099
"59886","Aromas of iris, violet and dark berry slowly take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers fleshy black cherry, plum, espresso, tobacco and a hint of vanilla alongside firm tannins. Drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",59886
"75036","Here's a youthful nine-year-old that offers intense aromas of crushed blue flower, leather, tobacco leaf and baked plum. The savory palate delivers crushed dried black cherry, prune, vanilla and nutmeg framed in velvety tannins. Drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",75036
"4289","Fragances of wild berries, bramble and honeysuckle pave the way for flavors of cherry cola, toffee and tangerine zest. This is soft and round in the mouth, with tannins that are almost imperceptible at first yet last through the finish, hand-in-hand with remarkably bright acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Israel",4289
"29647","Very similar to Peju's regular '05 Cab Franc, released a few months earlier, except it tastes much oakier. You'll find the soft structure and cherry, currant and violet flavors, but the toasty oak and caramel are overwhelming.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",29647
"105772","This opens with subdued, mature yellow apple, acacia and almond aromas that carry over to the abrupt, tangerine-inflected palate. It has a lean, bitter finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",105772
"54732","Deep, alluring aromas of blackberry and cassis are youthful and thus a bit animal and wild. In the mouth, this young CS is chunky, rubbery and dense. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black coffee are on the dark side, while the finish offers a meaty, substantive feel, tons of lasting fruit flavor, and a touch of heat and burn that will fade away with more time in bottle. Best from 2016–2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",54732
"55303","Soft and ripe green pears play on nose and palate where that textural, phenolic mouthfeel is the main feature, suggesting that this belongs firmly on the table.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",55303
"45949","An estate-grown wine in its second vintage, this comes from the cooler-climate hills of the coast. This plush wine is dark brown in color and brimming in stinky earth—a rich, funky and concentrated expression that's herbal, spicy and shy in raspberry fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45949
"72595","This racy, vivid wine carries an Oregon AVA, but the fruit is principally sourced from warm sites in the Columbia Gorge. Bright raspberries are set amidst sappy acidity, and the structure brings both precision and vitality into play.","Red","Red Blend","US",72595
"49456","Lots of flashy blackberry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet. Easy to drink, but feels way too soft to earn a higher score. Drink up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",49456
"6949","This wine's most outstanding quality is the elegant and delicate manner with which the bouquet slowly reveals itself. This vineyard-designate wine is a traditional blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo, opening with subtle aromas of red cherry, dried violet, moist earth, vanilla and cured meat.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",6949
"9837","This standard-issue Malbec is attractively priced and cohesively fruity without too many rough edges. The fruit tends more to red than dark with just a hint of vanilla on the finish.","Red","Malbec","US",9837
"59140","Made to commemorate the winery's 20th vintage, this smooth and polished effort combines choice lots from the Shea, Freedom Hill, Temperance Hill and Vista Hills vineyards. Sweet cherry fruit carries interesting suggestions of ash, smoke, anise and toasted almond, buffed and buttressed by crisp acids.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59140
"663","With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",663
"37505","This Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for a year-and-a-half. It's a dusty rose in hue, and its tart rhubarb fruit is speckled with peppery spice. The time on skins seems to have amped up the tannins past optimal balance. This is a one-of-a-kind style of Pinot Gris.","Rosé","Rosé","US",37505
"51509","Petite Verdot is a difficult wine to make interesting in its own right, but Reverie has pulled it off. It's very much like a Diamond Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, dry, tannic and filled with blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. Not exactly clear why you'd want a Petite Verdot instead of a Cabernet, except for the interest value, but it's certainly an achievement.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",51509
"30416","This wine has just enough residual sugar to take it to the upper threshhold of dry. It's quite full flavored with a thirst quenching mix of citrus, apple and pineapple. Crisp acidity enhances the freshness and contributes a tangy, lemony kick to the finish.","White","Riesling","US",30416
"56809","With 40% Grenache, 40% Syrah, 20% Carignan and no oak aging, this is a fresh and juicy wine with characteristics of black cherry, black berry, thyme, Asian spice and cola. Solid acidity and a medium finish make this an easy pleaser.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",56809
"103190","simple, straightforward Chianti Classico, it's made from 80% Sangiovese and other red varieties. It starts with earthy aromas of wet soil and violet. The palate offers almost-overripe plum, black cherry and cinnamon alongside astringent tannins. This isn't an ager so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",103190
"24779","This opens with aromas of dark berry, violet, toast, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor. The one-dimensional palate offers crushed plum, blackberry, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside drying, astringent tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",24779
"29954","A well-made and full-bodied wine, this has generous helpings of succulent blackberry and boysenberry flavors, with a firm texture of tannins and acidity to balance out all that richness. It smells fresh and fruity, tastes juicy and crisp, and seems to gain depth and interest with repeated sips. The blend includes 10% Petite Sirah and 5% Carignan.","Red","Zinfandel","US",29954
"7143","This blend of 59% Roussanne, 36% Grenache Blanc and 5% Viognier is very lemony on the nicely restrained nose that also offers mango, yellow apple and grapefruit pith. Once sipped, the wine is wide and welcoming with red and yellow apples, Meyer lemon and tangerine flavors, proving quite easy-drinking.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",7143
"35023","With small percentages of Syrah and Viognier, this Petite Sirah is simple and has a pronounced smoky personality.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",35023
"68224","While this smells slightly briny and gritty, there's controlled energy and a sense of quality to the palate. Peppery, dry flavors of apple and peach are lasting on a stone-fruity-heavy finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",68224
"61419","Ripe aromas of black cherry and blackberry come with hints of leafy herbs and a shot of alcohol. This four-grape blend is well structured but a touch tannic. Flavors of baked black fruits, herbs and olives finish savory, with plenty of unabsorbed oak.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",61419
"82130","Saline, mineral, match stick and tropical fruit aromas define the bouquet. It feels plump but flat, with maderized flavors of white fruits that feature bitterness and not much kick. It's fleshy, remaining slightly bitter on the finish.","White","Albariño","Spain",82130
"16870","Soft and diffuse, this offers light flavors of pear with a hint of spice. Done entirely in stainless steel, it's a good, all-purpose white.","White","Pinot Gris","US",16870
"86234","This half-and-half blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon is structured and with a firm layer of tannins. It also has plenty of ripe berry fruits that are balancing the more serious texture. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",86234
"60689","This is ripe in cherry and red currant flavors, with a smoky, bacony touch from the charred oak. The mouthfeel is marked by edgy tannins. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",60689
"44336","The nose of this bottling is extremely focused on black raspberry and grapeseed, and its snappy dark fruit is tempered with agebrush, lavender and mace aromas. Firm and upright tannins frame the palate, where dark cranberry and clove flavors combine for layers of energy and depth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",44336
"73261","Supple at first, with brown sugar and prune flavors that seem sweetly ripe, but this full-bodied wine firms up substantially on the finish, where it turns a bit leathery in flavor and coffee-astringent. Drink now, before the fruit fades.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",73261
"42988","A very structured, firm wine with excellent acidity and dark, dry tannins. The alcohol does show through, but the wine is firm and very dense, a big success from this Lurton family owned property.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",42988
"23890","This barrel-fermented, estate-grown wine matches its luscious citrus and pineapple fruit to veins of butter, caramel and toast. It's perfectly balanced, lively and fresh, even after being open for a full 24 hours. The style, now becoming particular to many Oregon Chardonnays, sits squarely on the fence between the hyper-lushness of California and the minerality of northern Burgundies.","White","Chardonnay","US",23890
"96931","Ripe berry aromas are darkened by heavy notes of tarry asphalt and barrel char. This feels full and chewy, with peppery flavors of dusty spice, hickory smoke and black fruits. A short, bold finish is firm but low on fruit.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",96931
"57052","From old vines, this now-mature wine shows almonds, touches of toast and gentle acidity. It has a creamy texture that only hints at the original minerality and crispness. Now, it is a smooth wine with only a light connection to the Melon grape, offering concentration and a rich aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",57052
"75353","Rounded wine, softly fruity. Its attractiveness comes from ripe white fruits, soft structure and a generous feel. It's not for aging and can be drunk now.","White","Chardonnay","France",75353
"95227","Off in the nose with hints of sweet cherry, almost bubblegum, this Petite Sirah gets supertannic and oaky quick and just doesn't have enough fruit to pull it through.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",95227
"36403","This is produced only in the best vintages; here from just two barrels the winery noted as standouts. Concentrated flavors of cherry and cassis are amplified with a streak of red licorice. Acids keep the wine poised and fresh, and the finish brings in a dollop of chocolate and a hint of cut tobacco.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36403
"45567","Sourced from Ceja Vineyards, this wine impresses in crisp dried red fruit and perfumed floral aromatics that go on for days. Velvety in texture and robust in power, it offers big shoulders around a tartness of acidity and complex baking spice.","Red","Grenache","US",45567
"1858","A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1858
"6079","An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics.","White","Riesling","France",6079
"80294","This opens with intense floral aromas that recall white roses, lemon zest and apricot. The linear, vibrant palate offers pink grapefruit, white peach and a flint note alongside crisp acidity that leaves a refreshing finish. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.","White","Riesling","Italy",80294
"33734","Sweet and fantastically fruity, this blend of Gewürz, Riesling, Orange Muscat and Chenin Blanc erupts in jammy orange, pineapple, green apple, peach, pear, honeysuckle and spice flavors.","White","White Blend","US",33734
"35297","If you love the biggest and boldest of Barolos, this beautiful wine is for you. It puts forth power and determination with confidence thanks to its aromas of barbecue spice, mesquite, roasted espresso bean, vanilla and ripe red cherry. Give it five more years.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",35297
"96259","Lots of delicious, complex blackberry, crème de cassis, mineral and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96259
"58914","The nose seems closed. There is just a hint of earthiness. The slender palate has edges of mocha and smoke that frame its fresh crisp tart red-cherry fruit. The body is light but held within a very fine-boned structure that leads to a dry clean finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",58914
"3462","A bit light and tight on the nose, this shows condensed strawberries and dried beef aromas before diving into a palate of purple berries. It's an easy-drinking, well-made wine for everyday sipping, just not showing much extra pop.","Red","Syrah","US",3462
"45043","Jasmine, wisteria and white stone fruit aromas lead the nose, while the bright silky palate offers green apple, juicy white peach and citrus. Crisp acidity and a lively refined perlage provide balance.","White","Glera","Italy",45043
"63398","Sierra Cantabria's wines are usually so good that one that's simple, tasty and regular such as this might get overlooked. But if you want an honest crianza with touches of balsam wood, bacon and rubber as well as dry plum and cherry fruit, this is it. Finishes peppery, with full tannins and oak-driven mocha flavor.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",63398
"60623","Elderberry, white pepper, leather, asphalt and black olive show on the nose of this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties done in the region's savory style. The flavors are mellow overall, with wildfire smoke and a bit of herbaceousness decorating the elderberry and graphite core.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",60623
"42349","This 100% Grenache was aged in neutral French oak. It's dry in style, but rich, with flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and toast. An edge of acidity adds verve.","Rosé","Rosé","US",42349
"54374","Flowery in the nose, with hints of grass, green melon and mustard seed. The tangy, crystal-clean palate is loaded with orange, tangerine, nectarine and apricots. The long, flavorful finish features citrus pith, lime and minerals. If you want a combination of complexity and forwardness, this is your wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",54374
"72053","Boisterous flower and tropical fruit aromas make for a big bouquet that penetrates deeply into the ripe, fruity palate. This is surprisingly balanced in body and alcohol for a wine with such bold presence. It finishes long, with hints of ginger, black tea and pleasantly bitter phenolics.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",72053
"28858","New French oak dominates this Chardonnay, giving buttered toast, vanilla bean and butterscotch flavors the starring role. It's not very interesting, despite some good apricot, tangerine and tropical fruit.","White","Chardonnay","US",28858
"104679","Modest pear, pineapple and lemon oil scents mark the nose, while the palate suggests marshmallow, pear and melon. This is full bodied and slightly honeyed in style, with a long, plush finish redolent of ripe citrus. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",104679
"27350","A blend of Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio, Nocera and Nero d'Avola, this polished wine conveys earthy aromas including violet, ripe berry, leather, game and baking spice. The savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, licorice, cinnamon and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",27350
"105836","This is a soft ready-to-drink wine. It has light tannins, a mineral edge and stalky black-currant fruits. It is attractively accessible now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",105836
"34715","Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, underbrush and tobacco lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The ripe, dense palate offers black cherry, cassis, clove and dried hay alongside round tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",34715
"96361","Though technically off-dry, this tastes tart and racy, following its lively aromatics with crisp citrus-fruit flavors of Key lime, Satsuma orange, and ripe apricots. The fruit sources—Evergreen and Wahluke Slope vineyards—are among the best in Washington for Riesling.","White","Riesling","US",96361
"95269","Savory and meaty on first take, with ample berry on the nose as warmth and leather seep through. The palate is round and healthy, with a mix of succulent berry and savory spice and leather pumping up the flavor profile. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",95269
"11736","Faint hints of aromatic tart cherry try to burst through the closed nose. The fruit is present on the fresh palate with astonishing purity. There is real concentration and a richer, almost plush texture at the core despite the svelte nature of this wine. A real triumph that expresses pure aromatic red cherry with real elegance. This has beauty, charm, length and authenticity.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",11736
"104303","This broad, soft wine has hints of spice as well as ripe apricot flavors. The texture is easy and attractive. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",104303
"76716","Spicy, dusty and juicy, this wine is a mix of black plum and black cherry, supported by whips of anise and bay leaf that give it an herbal element, possibly reflective of the cooler vintage. Medium acidity and firm tannins round out the experience.","Red","Zinfandel","US",76716
"56217","Rubbery, sulfuric aromas of scrambled eggs are gaseous and difficult to penetrate. This blend of 60% Giró and 40% Monastrell feels choppy, grabby and high in acidity. Flavors of rubbery plum and berry are tart and eggy, while the tannins are fierce on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",56217
"9001","Apple and citrus aromas are a touch briny. This feels pulpy, with standard weight and balance. Dry bready yeasty melon and white-fruit flavors finish with a salty side note.","White","Verdejo","Spain",9001
"54162","Aromas of rose, forest floor, toast and dark berry lead the nose on this straightforward, vibrant red. The racy palate delivers tart cherry, fresh raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside brisk acidity. Drink through 2016.","Red","Barbera","Italy",54162
"49881","Tart and juicy, with crisply-rendered berry and plum fruit flavors. As with all the Smasne wines, the oak is a large presence, here adding a striking note of clove. The tannins hint at a slight green streak, but the overall balance is fine.","Red","Syrah","US",49881
"101063","Berry aromas with a hint of pine and juniper form the opening on this fresh-style Rioja. A quick wash of red plum and raspberry flavors comes with an herbal leaning and minty notes. This finishes firm but light in weight, with a minty aftertaste.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",101063
"43751","Elegant in terms of packaging and content, this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon offers delicate aromas of forest berry, cassis and blue flower. The wine builds momentum in the mouth thanks to its natural power and rich texture.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",43751
"10958","There's an exotic character to this mouthfilling Chenin, with its round melon and tangerine flavors and aromas. Though the wine could use a touch more acid to enliven the mouthfeel, overall it has a classy, curvy character that recommends it.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",10958
"4825","Minty bay leaf and leather define this wine in a savory, earthy way, with a strong notion of forest floor at its core. Firm tannins and subtle oak contribute a leathery aspect to the texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4825
"74038","Deftly showing restraint with this grape that can easily be made into overripe wine, this bottling offers clean aromas of nectarine, apple blossom, bubblegum and tropical guava cream. A mouthwatering acidity hits the palate first, followed by a line of tense chalkiness, then comes the stonefruit, lime juice and a tactile sizzle into the finish.","White","Viognier","US",74038
"79434","This is a fruity, crisp wine. Red currant and candied red-berry fruits fit into a balanced, just off-dry character. The wine is bright with a light sparkle at the end.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",79434
"106157","Aromas of white spring flower, mint and orchard fruit lead the way. Bright and silky, the refined palate delivers yellow apple, peach and Bartlett pear set against crisp acidity and a refined perlage.","White","Glera","Italy",106157
"3509","Hailing from the winery's estate vineyard, this wine offers aromas of baking spice, wood spice, milk chocolate and herb. The flavors are quite reserved in style, showing a sense of elegance, with barrel notes lingering on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",3509
"41439","At 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this drinks like a Cab, combining ripe cassis and chocolate notes with hints of mint, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's full-bodied and a bit chewy in texture, which should serve it well through at least 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Australia",41439
"57995","There's a zesty, invigorating feel to this lime-kissed spätlese, calibrated by layers of sweet, juicy peach and pear that fill out the palate. It's effortlessly breezy yet nuanced, with hints of saffron, fennel and spice.","White","Riesling","Germany",57995
"3702","This is an exciting and promising blend for the winery and region. Cabernet Sauvignon and the Brunello clone of Sangiovese present aromas of pine wood, wet slate, mud, dark red cherries and tobacco smudge. Elderberry, juniper and cedar show on the woody palate that combines great acidity with firm structure.","Red","Red Blend","US",3702
"32458","Red Mountain fruit from three different sites is used to create this delicious Syrah, laced with powerful flavors of coffee liqueur and chocolate. Cofermented with a dash of Viognier, it's satiny and citrusy, speckled with pepper, and maintains an elegant precision for a wine that offers such richness.","Red","Red Blend","US",32458
"13052","A lingering vein of dark char, spice and toast acts as a counterpoint to this wine's ripe, black-fruited character. The palate is rich and densely concentrated, kept taut by a frame of bold tannins. It's pleasant now but should develop smoky, savory complexities through 2023.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",13052
"58560","Smooth, rich and soft, this is an attractively balanced blend. It shows black berry fruits, sweet acidity and a very soft, dense and velvety texture.","Red","Red Blend","Austria",58560
"65300","Nice bright fruit aromas and a lively play of minerality and good fresh fruit make this a definite everyday choice for fans of cleaner whites. The wine is not terribly deep but it's playful and flavorful.","White","Chardonnay","US",65300
"89635","Sharply herbal, this shows a bit of a green edge, which comes across as bitterness on the finish. The pale red-fruit flavors hint at thistle and bramble more than ripe berry, but the balance is there to carry the wine well with food.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",89635
"34179","Planted in 1983, this is the original Willamette Valley Vineyards estate vineyard. These old vines give an extra dollop of herb and stem, well integrated into concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit. This has the tannic muscle and acid underpinning to age well. Drink now–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",34179
"93333","The prestige cuvée from this producer, this has richness and a dense texture that brings out the ripe fruits. From a good, if not great, vintage, it is beautifully balanced, still young to taste and likely to age well. Drink now for the fruit or wait until 2018 for more maturity.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",93333
"41521","Crushed violet, herb, wild berry, leather, exotic incense, eucalyptus and balsamic aromas carry over to the elegantly structured palate underscored by a mineral vein. It's bright and fresh, with young, tightly wound tannins that need time to unfurl. Drink 2018–2031.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",41521
"69864","This powerful wine that also holds 5% Cabernet Franc shyly packs a punch. At first it comes off as elegant, soft and highly approachable. Faint notions of blackberry and black cherry are highlighted amidst a concentrated, tannic build.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",69864
"39556","Chock-a-block full of strawberry, black cherry and a sliver of orange peel, this wine is big-boned, well-structured and fleshy. Mouthfilling and juicy, the palate shows touches of black tea and tobacco, making for a lively tension between the earthiness and exuberance of fruit. Drink now through 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",39556
"14084","An animal cracker aroma accompanies notes of peach and mineral. Spritzy, fresh and citrusy in the mouth, this features orange and peach flavors. The finish has a pithy bitterness.","White","Albariño","Spain",14084
"21248","This is a dry wine, firm with tannins and perhaps missing the fruit element. It has a dry core along with acidity. The future will leave it still on the dry side.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",21248
"69923","This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69923
"27268","If you like old-fashioned country fruit supported by a forest's worth of oak, then this is probably up your alley. It's a rusty, aging wine with mossy, murky aromas of roast plum and carob. The palate is fading in terms of fruit, but there's a whole lot of vanilla, dill and resin in wait. Still lively but a little too oaky and thin.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",27268
"84777","Too much unripeness in this wine, which shows aromas of asparagus and broccoli. Tastes somewhat better than it smells, with blackberry and black cherry notes.","Red","Syrah","US",84777
"92594","This wine from Maison Ginestet is all crisp, green fruit. Light and bright, it bursts with acidity and perfumed fruitiness. Drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",92594
"13435","Aromas of vanilla-flecked and butter-laced pastry filled with cassis sauce show on the nose of this rich blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Mourvèdre from the Bien Nacido and Jada vineyards. The sip is very well structured by upright sticky tannins, which hold up flavors of crushed gravel and slate and a piquant boysenberry jam.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",13435
"7435","Electric purple in color, it conveys wiry aromas of wet dog, green herbs and berry fruits. The palate is loud and clacky, with a jumpy overall feel and an overriding sense of youth. Boysenberry, blueberry and blackberry flavors come with undertones of green herbs and licorice, while the finish is aggressive and moderately complex. Drink through 2019.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",7435
"53441","Firmly structured, this is a rich wine in a style that is rounded and ripe. It has light tannins and spicy acidity to balance the general richness of the wine. Drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",53441
"66657","From the producer's Mount George Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this has 12% Petit Verdot within, the vineyard first planted in 1868 in these volcanic mountain soils. Juicy, dusty red currant and cedar are girded by firm tannins that present as chalky and lengthy, the soil a consistent echo on the palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66657
"102151","Five different grape varieties go into this blend, including a surprising 8% Pinot Noir. There's a touch of grilled tomato upfront, followed by more traditional flavors of cassis, vanilla and chocolate. This medium- to full-bodied wine is open knit and ready to drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Australia",102151
"66090","Surprisingly tight for such a ripe and generous vintage; decanted if you plan on drinking it soon. The fruit is concentrated and pure: raspberry, cherry and cassis with a chaser of lemony acid. The acids are not quite integrated yet, and the oak seems unusually restrained. Looks set to evolve in interesting ways; purchase it in quantity, then check on it regularly to see what it's doing.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66090
"43143","The impenetrably obscure label design makes this difficult to find, but once your hands are on the bottle, it's smooth sailing. A “second label” Bordeaux-style blend, this delicious, fruity and distinctive wine puts a wrap of tangy citrus around black cherry, coffee and licorice components. Malbec is the principal grape, with smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Canada",43143
"15152","Chunky and oily on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is full and balanced, with nectarine, pineapple and lychee flavors. Pithy and citrusy on the finish. Ripe and good in a regular way.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",15152
"227","This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry.","White","White Blend","Italy",227
"5778","Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",5778
"91682","A welcome presence of clean, spicy oak aromas and flavors lifts this full-bodied and fruity wine to a higher level of complexity. It's elegant in balance and smooth in texture, showing a lingering, light spicy finish.","Red","Barbera","US",91682
"7063","A great value in Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, Hunter's 2007 marries ripe nectarine aromas and flavors with just enough acidity and a touch of grassiness to retain focus and varietal character. The lack of overt herbal notes makes it easy to pair with food, or drink on its own.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",7063
"49877","Carillon opens with a dark, concentrated appearance and smoky aromas of barbecue, spice and toasted oak. The fruit element comes forth on the palate, revealing the wine's bright cherry and crème de cassis notes.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",49877
"77307","From the south facing Côte du Py, this oak-aged wine is full of ripe fruit that is given a crisp edge by the acidity. Lightly textured, the wine is tight, mineral and likely to age. Jean-Ludovic Loron is the cru property's fifth generation. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",77307
"63145","Quite dark and smoky, this fruity Syrah combines blueberry, blackberry and cassis flavors in a deep mix. Earthy tannins are well-managed and provide a proper underpinning.","Red","Syrah","US",63145
"17061","Shows a real Burgundian-style earthiness, with rich humous, mushroom and gamy, leathery flavors, marbled with a deep well of spicy plum sauce. This earthy richness, with the distinct tannins, suggests ageability for this dry wine. Best after 2009.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",17061
"84829","A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity. The fruit goes right to the green apples, kiwi and juicy lemon flavors, but the structure is bold and rounds out these crisp fruits. A wine for aging, perhaps 2–3 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",84829
"102970","Well-made and dancing in acidity, this Cabernet is juicy in notes of red currant and pomegranate, yet slightly exotic on the back palate, with hints of cardamom and cinnamon. Layered without being overly concentrated, the wine is built to age like its bigger brother (the Family Reserve), able to hold on and build nuance through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",102970
"17997","Finished dry, this combines elements of orange peel and citrus in a simple refreshing style.","Rosé","Rosé","US",17997
"84127","This 75-25 blend of Chardonnay and Grillo (aged only in stainless steel) makes a great companion to fresh seafood dishes. The wine offers loads of citrus and pear notes, with a chalky mineral overtone and bright acidity.","White","White Blend","Italy",84127
"67188","Made with 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of black currant, anise and leather. The firm palate delivers blackberry jam, cedar and toast alongside assertive tannins while a hint of vanilla marks the firm finish. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",67188
"105422","Loaded with spice and lychee flavors, this is a rounded and rich wine. Not complex but attractive, it is ready to drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",105422
"76227","Ripe black-fruit aromas are cuddly and reflect the warm conditions of 2012. Tight and ribbed on the palate, this has the structure to handle blackberry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors without seeming overripe or jammy. A saturated finish benefits from the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2023.","Red","Mencía","Spain",76227
"33220","Bright raspberry and tart red--cherry notes are juxtaposed with complexities of garrigue and bramble in this elegant, spry rosé. Nuanced savoriness lends a slightly cerebral tone that's unexpected and intriguing, but also particularly suited for pairing with grilled meat and fish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",33220
"12412","This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Grand Ciel (42%), Upchurch (31%), Ciel du Cheval (19%) and Klipsun vineyards. Wound-up aromas of black cherry and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen. It flat out impresses.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",12412
"43131","This is Washington Syrah at its most distinctive. The fruit stands out with tart and tangy flavors of boysenberry, raspberry and a tartness reminiscent of cranberry. There are streaks of meat, smoke and bacon, and the acids are clean. This is a glorious food wine, but so juicy, assertive and delicious that it almost demands to be drunk on its own. Will it evolve in the cellar? Probably, but it's hard to keep your hands off it long enough to find out.","Red","Syrah","US",43131
"94412","Packaged in an elegantly frosted bottle, this brawny wine deliver the goods. It shows intensity, persistency and is tightly packed with luscious aromas of black cherry, leather, tobacco and black olive. The tannins are velvety and rich without being overdone.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",94412
"64757","Light wood-aging has given this wine some rich structure while keeping its natural fruity character. Black currant fruitiness dominates the attractive juicy nature of the wine with its smooth texture and final acidity. Drink from 2016.","Red","Malbec","France",64757
"56012","An odd style that may not appeal to everyone, with apple and pineapple flavors marked by butter and vanilla. It's medium bodied, and picks up a hint of lemon on the finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",56012
"66059","Made with 50% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of blue flower and red berry. The easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, black currant and ground pepper while mellow tannins offer soft support. Drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",66059
"24298","Principally Tempranillo, this blended red shows light berry fruit and stiff, earthy tannins. Aged 17 months in 17% new French oak, it doesn't quite come into balance, and finishes with chalky acids.","Red","Red Blend","US",24298
"58324","Former longtime Edmeades winemaker Van Williamson is offering the world his take on cool-climate Mendocino Pinot Noir with this and his Cerise Vineyard bottlings. This one is light in color but weighty on the palate with rich, spicy notes of raspberry-vanilla wafers and earth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58324
"6507","Made with 65% Nebbiolo, 20% Vespolina and 15% Uva Rara, this polished red from Piedmont offers aromas and flavors of dried red cherry, clove, baking spice and rust. It's well balanced, with silky tannins and fresh acidity while a graphite note closes the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",6507
"41302","The Red Hills Estate bottling sends a spicy note sailing out of the glass, with a pleasing follow-up of red currant, cherry, cinnamon and vanilla. Medium-bodied and displaying a core of tart fruit, this tails off into a tannic finish that needs a bit more polish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",41302
"29047","With strong new-wood character, this wine has vanilla and toast flavors. The concentrated red-berry fruits are suppressed, giving a wine that needs time to develop. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",29047
"62080","Initial aromas of desert herbs and blackberries lose steam with airing. A flush palate delivers candied cherry and chocolate flavors that carry over to the solid finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",62080
"95001","From a great year for vintage Champagne, this is a fine wine, bringing out minerality, green stone fruits and mouthwatering acidity. It is a wine for aging, so give this impressive Champagne 3–4 years.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",95001
"86996","Light wisps of raspberry and strawberry highlight a restrained sense of winemaking, allowing soft tannin to buoy the fruit and medium acidity.","Red","Merlot","US",86996
"79052","This wine has some richness, with ripe black currants and balanced acidity. The wood-aging just shows but, again, is balanced. With its fresh fruitiness, the wine will age quickly, so drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",79052
"34511","A briny-smelling nose is lacking in ripe appealing fruit. This feels pithy and oily, while bitter briny flavors come up short on fruit and friendliness. Pyrazines and bitterness control the finish.","White","Albariño","Spain",34511
"80685","Pretty good for the price, although in Pinot Noir, the old adage of you-get-what-you-pay-for remains true. It's simple, with a flavor of oak-infused raspberry jam and lots of zesty acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80685
"77412","Here's a Sauvignon Blanc (with 15% Chardonnay) from a warm Italian climate (Cortona, Tuscany) that offers broad and thick aromas of passionfruit, peach and a touch of mango. The wine is light and streamlined in the mouth and makes a good partner to light finger foods or appetizers.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Italy",77412
"45334","All coming from Block 95 of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a beguiling wine with a complex range of notes that include caramel, spice, squash and cream. It shows excellent balance, length and finesse, with the enjoyment as much about mouth-feel as flavor.","White","Chardonnay","US",45334
"53686","An opaque purple Pinot? Yes indeed. This wine from southerly Bío Bío looks like Malbec and smells extracted and heavy. The palate is tannic, while intense flavors of grapy berry and black fruits finish peppery, then loamy, then hot.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",53686
"66062","Light, fragrant and aromatic, this wine has beautiful acidity and a bright lemon and yellow fruit that combine richness and freshness at the same time. Its touch of honey fills the palate, while the crisp aftertaste leave a refreshing feeling in the mouth.","White","Chardonnay","France",66062
"106122","Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017–2024.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",106122
"20047","Crisp green plum and gooseberry aromas lend an invitingly cool touch to this otherwise sun-kissed spätlese. The palate is delicately honeyed, showcasing a bounty of sweet, succulent apricot, tangerine and pink grapefruit flavors. Spry texture and a spine tingling acidic backbone lend impeccable balance.","White","Riesling","Germany",20047
"66849","This has intense fragrances of moist earth, blackberry, raisin and almond. The rich palate offers concentrated black cherry, plum, cinnamon and black pepper flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage and while it doesn't seem to have enough fresh acidity for long-term aging, it's velvety-smooth and delicious now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",66849
"13011","Effectively half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a tremendous wine. With very fine tannins, spice from a touch of wood and swathes of ripe fruits give this wine its concentration and its huge potential. The wine has weight and a dark, dense structure that will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2027.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",13011
"12218","Except for a slightly rustic edge to the way the wine feels in the mouth, this is a spectacular success. It stands next to much more expensive Merlots proudly. Dry and smooth in tannins, the cherry, red currant and pepper flavors are outstanding.","Red","Merlot","US",12218
"15196","Confusingly labeled as Pivot Blanc (not Pinot Blanc), this is actually a Riesling! Off dry, lightly fruity, with pleasant flavors of lemon and breakfast tea, honey and chamomile, it's best consumed young and chilled.","White","Riesling","US",15196
"64014","Creamy, balanced and tropical, it's a bang-up deal for the quality. Deeply layered in fig and vanilla, it offers sweet aromas of honeysuckle on the nose. Stock up for parties or all your midweek meals.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",64014
"81924","A blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Clairette and 20% Syrah, this wine represents a relative bargain in the rarified realm of Tavel. Notes of wet stone and citrus carry through from start to finish, joined on the midpalate by hints of white chocolate and raspberry. It's a relatively full-bodied rosé that can stand up to grilled meats.","Rosé","Rosé","France",81924
"34637","Blended from grapes from a range of different soils, this open, generous wine has richness and a structure that comes from the ripe apple and gooseberry fruits. The wine is textured and deserves to age. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",34637
"69623","A bright salmon color, this playful selection is bright and easy drinking. Aromas and flavors of melon rind, sweet pea, red cherry and cranberry fill the nose and mouth, with bright acidity that keeps the palate fresh and the finish clean.","Rosé","Rosé","France",69623
"95708","Concentrated tannins give this wine from organic grapes a powerful structure. For balance, it also has a more fruity character that offers blackberry and black plums. The dense texture means it needs to age until 2015.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",95708
"11348","Gritty stalky aromas suggest that the original material for this Gran Reserva was not fully ripe. This feels wide chunky and grabby, with harsh tannins. Stalky flavors of herbal raspberry and plum come with oaky vanilla accents and tomatoey spice on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",11348
"92624","This blend of Rabigato and Códega do Larinho grapes brings out the crisp acidity of a Douro white. The wine has a fragrant character with hedgerow fruits and white flower aromas. The aftertaste goes more towards yellow fruits while keeping all the freshness.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",92624
"75003","This wine boasts an expansive and complex lineup of aromas and flavors, ranging from dusty earth and cola through plummy fruit and hints of cinnamon and clove. It's plump and round in the mouth, with soft dusty tannins to provide support. Drink now through 2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",75003
"92568","Jumpy and nervy smelling, with tottering aromas of jammy berry and strawberry. It feels dilute at first, but more structure and body appear as the wine unfolds. The flavor of jammy raspberry is somewhat herbal, and the finish is light.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",92568
"21809","Six months in French oak lend a rounded feel and delicate spice to pressed apple and lemon flavors in this wine. While less forward and fruity in style than most New York Sauvignon Blanc, its richer body and slightly salty, saline palate are enticing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",21809
"27648","Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink now–2030.","White","Chardonnay","US",27648
"59415","More like an off white in color than actually pink, this 100% barrel-fermented, free-drained wine shows lemon blossoms, Pink Lady apple and lime zest on a very restrained nose. The palate is lively with tantalizing acidity, and fresh with light Meyer lemon zest and juice flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59415
"53832","You might want to give this 2–3 years in the cellar to meld. Currently, the palate is thick and heavy with jammy raspberries and cherries, with quite a lot of new French oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53832
"59854","This rich, jammy wine will appeal to many, with its sweet core of raspberry fruit candy. The texture is soft, fat and very rich, although there is sufficient acid and tannin to keep the wine in balance. No great complexity here, but it's easygoing and opulent.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",59854
"1417","Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",1417
"84567","Dill, vanilla, tobacco, earth and light red-fruit aromas comprise the classic nose. The palate feels tight and in good shape, while a mild berry flavor comes topped with touches of cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg, expressing Rioja in every way. Elegant and balanced; drink now.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",84567
"71688","Simple but solid, this offers delicate aromas of rose and red berry. The straightforward palate isn't as expressive, showing dried cherry, a note of star anise and sage alongside assertive astringent tannins that leave an abrupt, mouth-drying finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",71688
"21273","This is a flavorful, slightly heavy-feeling Chardonnay that offers ripe flavors of apricots, tropical fruits and pineapple cream. Although it's dry, it has a honeyed accent, especially on the spicy finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",21273
"65281","Made entirely from Syrah grown on two vineyard sites, then fermented and aged in stainless steel, this wine is light pink-orange in color and begins with a robust flavor of hazelnut and savory lemon peel. Dry and crisp, it remains lighthearted in the glass, finishing with a tease of grapefruit.","Rosé","Rosé","US",65281
"58249","Simple, easy and balanced, this crowd-pleasing Cab will satisfy for its wealth of ripe fruit and oak flavors. Floods the mouth with cassis, licorice and melted milk chocolate, wrapped in smooth, gentle tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58249
"29129","Organic grapes grown on the estate's schist soil go into this delicious, ripe and clean wine. Shot through with a good balance of red berries, red currants and tight acidity, it has good depth of flavor along with a surface glitter of bright freshness.","Rosé","Rosé","France",29129
"22578","Ruffino's Modus (a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot) boasts thick extraction in the form of chocolate fudge and cherry candy. Lighter tones of apple skin and green herbs pick up the rear. It's on the ripe side with prune-like flavors; drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",22578
"32922","Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",32922
"103267","One of the best Central Coast Pinots in memory. Incredibly rich and full bodied, filled with juicy flavors of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, tobacco, smoke, vanilla and earth. Yet the body is delicate and light as air on the palate. The spicy aftertaste lasts for a full minute.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103267
"61782","A concentrated Bordeaux-style blend comprised of 59% Cab Sauv, 19% Merlot, 12% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot. Black currant and plum dominate the nose while flavors of herbal spice, cigar box and licorice flesh out the medium-weight mouth. The tannins are strong but refined, lingering well through the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Israel",61782
"56990","A light and easy Soave, it offers delicate sensations of stone fruit and citrus alongside bright acidity. It would work well with spaghetti topped with mussels or vegetables.","White","White Blend","Italy",56990
"39964","This is a soft wine, fruity without great definition. A ripe, red fruit character contrasts with a bitter acidity. It is ready to drink. The blend is 50/50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.","Rosé","Rosé","France",39964
"14181","A wine with great color, attractive smoky and red fruit flavors and a touch of tannin. It has a good structure as well, reflecting wood aging as well as fine fruit. Drink from 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",14181
"102658","Stéphane Defraine's wine is rich with dark black fruits. The tannins with spice and a firm core give this wine density. It is already powerful and concentrated. It will be ready from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",102658
"18244","A blend of grapes from different regions of the Douro, this is a ripe, concentrated wine. Perfumed black fruits and plenty of acidity give it a crisp while smooth texture. The wine is well in balance, hinting at minerality and is ready to drink starting from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",18244
"73645","It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up.","Red","Red Blend","US",73645
"57932","Cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, herb, wood spice and cherry aromas lead to lightly styled cherry and cola flavors. The tannins bring a tacky feel.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",57932
"39244","Aromas of black cherries marinated in spirits, menthol, leather and chopped herbs lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried berries, licorice, tobacco and mocha alongside the warmth of evident alcohol and jarring tannins. Give it a few years to let the tannins soften up a bit but then drink before the fruit dries up.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",39244
"47688","This is pure Cabernet from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard; there is nothing subtle or gentle about this wine. It's a powerhouse, sharp and astringent, with edgy flavors of berry and granite. The rock/mineral component dominates the finish, which lingers and gently fades. Overall, this is a wine to cellar and to watch; it tastes like a high-altitude Malbec from a 7,000-foot Argentine vineyard.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47688
"38822","In this price range, this is one of the classiest Chardonnays currently on the market. Brightened with fine acidity, it's flavors of pineapple, buttered toast and cream are delicious.","White","Chardonnay","US",38822
"23766","The full tilt of freshly ground white pepper fills the nose, edged with hints of yeast and peppery greenery like watercress and arugula. The palate continues in the same peppery, spicy fashion. This has immense verve and freshness and a splendidly light body.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",23766
"52540","This wine is big in every dimension, from an unusually deep gold color, to a smoky, oaky, toasted-baguette aroma to almost sweet flavors like poached pear that are backed by more buttery, smoky nuances and surprisingly good acidity. While it makes a big first impression, further sips bring out even more complexity, layers and length.","White","Chardonnay","US",52540
"70321","A McLaren Vale standard bearer, the 2010 Hillside is a complex, beguiling example of Shiraz. Toast and vanilla notes frame hints of raspberries, herbs and espresso on the nose, while the flavors add olive-tinged elements. Despite showing ample weight, this isn't the biggest wine, just one that shows impressive harmony and length. Drink now through at least 2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",70321
"50572","Port-like cedary aromas and mature flavors mark this full-bodied, ripe and broad-textured wine. It's tasty in a superripe way, although the high alcohol is apparent on the finish.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",50572
"79872","Pretty soft, in the manner of Paso Robles, and a little overripe, with a raisiny taste. But it's nice and dry and smooth in tannins, with rich blackberry fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",79872
"66812","Slightly reduced notes still hover, but the palate is fresh, ripe and generous with easy red and black cherry fruit. There could be more focus on the midpalate but this makes for easy, relaxing sipping.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",66812
"101746","The aromas are quite light for the variety, with the off-dry flavors lending some appeal.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",101746
"85922","Lasagna, meat-filled ravioli or mushroom risotto would make good pairing partners to this mild and crisp red. It offers notes of red berry, almond and cola.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",85922
"84576","The 1,800-feet high vineyards perched on scary-steep slopes in the upper Douro give the wine the cool character it needs. Winemaker Francisco Olazabal, a direct descendant of the Douro's Dona Antonia Ferreira, nurtures this unusual white wine (most Douro is red). It's perfumed, fruity and fresh. Acidity, tangy lemon and pineappletake center stage along with a steely inner core. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",84576
"30011","This classically crafted wine opens with earthy aromas of rose, violet, leather and a whiff of game while the juicy palate offers black cherry, cinnamon and star anise. Chewy tannins provide support. It's already approachable but will continue to drink well over the next several years. Drink through 2022.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",30011
"86292","Oaky aromas of graphite, vanilla, berry fruits and plum lead to a firm clampy high-acid palate with oak-rich flavors of spiced plum and currant. Mildly green, minty flavors close out a drawing tight finish.","Red","Syrah","Chile",86292
"27236","This wine is full of the ripe fruit as well as the mineral tannins typical of the Douro. It is a blend of typical grapes with a dominance of Touriga Franca. The wood aging has given the ripe black currant flavors a smooth, rounded character as well as adding spice. Drink this wine now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",27236
"36360","Its pale-gold color gives this rich, oaky style away. Lemon, green papaya, mint, nuts and wet stone all mingle with tongue-tingling acidity. The palate is on the lean and mean side at the moment, and the oak sticks out too, but there's a redeeming smokey, mineral finish and the hope that all will settle with time. Drink now–2025.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",36360
"96156","Black cherry juice, anise, thyme and pepper show on the nose of this bottling from the Riboli family. The palate is easygoing and lighter in body, with dried blueberry, more pepper and a touch of soy.","Red","Merlot","US",96156
"52262","Dark and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy-handed flavors of raspberry jam and toast that have a vegetal edge.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52262
"8597","Heavy and dull, with a soft texture framing cherry, berry and spice flavors. Pinot's famously silky texture is there, but the wine isn't offering much else.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8597
"28827","This wine offers more power and heat on the palate than would be expected given the listed alcohol by volume, a hammering of huge tannins holding the fruit hostage. An unpleasant fish-sauce aroma mars the nose.","Red","Zinfandel","US",28827
"52228","For six generations, the Ferreira family has owned this estate, a parcel of which boasts 100-year-old vines planted as a traditional field blend. It yields an impressive, serious and ageworthy wine, with dense tannins, powerful ripe black-plum and damson fruit and a tight character recalling schist soil. Drink from 2023.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",52228
"75526","The fruit from this well-located vineyard shines in this new vintage. Cherries and berries are set in a composty, moist, loamy framework. Hints of barnyard are subtle enough to add texture and depth. Lovely complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75526
"9353","Smoky oak enwraps fully developed layers of cherry and blackberry fruit in this thick wine packed with generous tannins. A hearty backbone of oak accents additional leather and dark chocolate flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",9353
"42324","The estate belongs to the Borie family, one of the grand names of Bordeaux, with the wine making done by the team of Château Ducru-Beaucaillou in Saint-Julien. The result is an aromatic, balanced wine that is both structured and fruity. It has fine tannins, black currant fruit and a perfumed aftertaste.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",42324
"42739","With the addition of 20% Grenache, this pushes the rich fruit flavors front and center. Ripe blueberries are in the foreground, cutting through some astringent tannins. There is little evidence of the herbal character that many Washington Syrahs evoke, but it's a bold, fruit-driven wine that is immediately enjoyable.","Red","Syrah","US",42739
"11741","Full bodied, creamy in texture and lush on the palate, this wine offers a thrilling mouthful of satisfaction. Menthol, vanilla and cedar notes frame ripe, plummy fruit, while the velvety finish features lingering spice. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",11741
"87049","Always a good value, Recanati's Yasmin line is an easy-pleasing selection. Inviting aromas of freshly sliced peach, lychee and rose water lead seamlessly into flavors of green melon and lime on the palate. The finish is short, but clean and refreshing. Mevushal.","White","White Blend","Israel",87049
"26777","Elderberry and black currant fruit mesh with cedar, smoked beef and pencil lead on the nose of this impressive bottling of a rarely solo grape. A pointed graphite minerality shows on the palate, where blueberry and black-plum fruit are enhanced by tobacco and dark-chocolate nuance.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",26777
"44277","All tangy fruit, this simple wine is light, with citrus and crisp pear flavors. A touch of honey adds a soft side while keeping its zesty fruit right in place. Drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",44277
"65480","Gritty white-fruit aromas show a note of vanilla. This tastes of bland passion fruit, with a weedy note thrown in. On the finish, this doesn't give much at all.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",65480
"72868","A classic nose of roses and Asian spice precedes an intense palate with substantial residual sugar. Medium, perfumed finish. Serve with sweeter Thai dishes.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",72868
"54692","This is a superripe wine. With its apricot and mango fruit flavors it is exotic and far removed from traditional white Bordeaux. A blend of Sauvignons Blanc and Gris, it has light signs of wood aging that add some spice to the very rich character of the wine. Drink from the end of 2016.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",54692
"18976","Anisette, steeped plum, tar and espresso aromas take shape in the glass. The concentrated palate offers fleshy wild cherry, dark berry, graphite, coffee and allspice alongside chewy tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",18976
"102330","A complete package, this shows lavender, smoke, boysenberry and black raspberry aromas on the nose. Plenty of acidity appears on the palate, where black pepper, white pepper, thyme and bay leaf spice up the tight blackberry core, finishing on a slightly caramelized note.","Red","Syrah","US",102330
"76713","Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, as is typical in all of this producer's Syrahs, this wine offers a wild, feral intensity on the nose of black pepper, cigar box and leather. From there, it softens with well-defined layers of blueberry and blackberry, the tannins settled and structured, the wine finishing in dusty oak.","Red","Syrah","US",76713
"24334","Endowed with plenty of fruit, this wine swirls together notes of raspberry and vanilla, then tops off that delicious blend with hints of mint and other herbs. The lovely creamy texture turns silky and fresh on the finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",24334
"64559","With the same winemaking team as Bouchard Père et Fils in Burgundy, this wine is rich and generous. It has great red fruits and hints of the toast from the wood aging of part of the wine. It is a generous wine that will age well over the next year, so drink from late 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",64559
"45172","Produced from vineyard around the 13th-century castle, the wine has concentration, rich tannins and ripe berry fruit. Pepper and spice bring out the texture of the wine that is freshened by acidity.","Red","Gamay","France",45172
"78771","Equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot give this wine a ripe character. The wood aging shows in the smoky flavors that underline the juicy black-currant fruits. The wine is attractive and will soon show its fruitiness. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",78771
"64187","The potential for this grape grown in cool California climates remains very high, as evidenced in this crisp and bracing bottling. Cut limes, chalk and wet slate are leveled by richer nectarine and lime blossom notes on the nose, while the sizzlingly acidic palate combines fresh citrus with green pear, green apple and lemon balm flavors.","White","Albariño","US",64187
"32958","Winemaker Sabrine Rodem strips wines down to their essence in her Ex Anima line, showing the savory side of this cool-climate Syrah. Black peppercorn, rosemary, cola and blueberry aromas show on the nose, while the palate packs cracked pepper, ripe olallieberry and dried beef flavors with tarry tension.","Red","Syrah","US",32958
"87899","This is a bit vegetal on the nose, where nectarine aromas compete with greener notes of canned beans and asparagus. In the mouth, this is oily in feel, while flavors of green fruits trend toward herbaceous. A minerally finish with citrus flavors and herbal leftovers is what you'd expect.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",87899
"80069","This is a classic Barbaresco, offering a quintessential Nebbiolo fragrance of rose, tobacco and Alpine herbs. The palate delivers wild cherry and raspberry flavors, with notes of white pepper, mint and mineral. It boasts structure, elegance and depth.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",80069
"13595","This pretty wine is rich, dry and softly tannic. Although it's a little high in alcohol, it feels smooth and round, showing Cab's riper side of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and chocolate, generously oaked. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's great to drink now and over the next four years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",13595
"39578","Firm and refined, this opens with aromas of wild berry, leather, game and a note of chopped herb. The round, full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove, toast, mint and licorice alongside ripe, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It should develop more complexity over the next decade. Drink 2016–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",39578
"17295","This is a wonderful edition to Pearl, Sparkman's 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrant and energetic, the kind of high-wire flavors more commonly found in Sancerre. Three days after it was first tasted, the wine was still drinking beautifully, with candied mixed fruits and terrific concentration.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",17295
"65409","The family farms 125 acres in the Russian River Valley, where the Sauvignon Blanc is planted in gravelly soils. The resulting wine is stately in bristling acidity, ripe melon, peach and a sneaky streak of jalapeño that gives intrigue. Juicy and ripe, it offers a moderate level of richness that's pleasing on the palate.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",65409
"27332","This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27332
"39632","Boldly flavored and full-bodied, this is marked by strong, spicy-sweet oak aromas and flavors. It has a massive richness of tannins, gobs of ripe boysenberry and black cherry character, and a very deep red color. Despite the hefty structure, it's drinkable now if accompanied by equally rich food.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",39632
"67677","This medium-bodied, unbaked wine has light butter and fig aromas that lead to vivid citrus flavors and a good crisp balance. The wine is nicely dry, well-balanced and refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",67677
"69559","A proprietary blend of Zinfandel and Malbec, with smaller parts Merlot, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, Heritage is powerful and soft. It's awash in blueberry, red plum and vanilla, all verging on superripe, the finish particularly intense.","Red","Red Blend","US",69559
"103892","There's intriguing precision to the nose of this bottling from Chad Melville and family. A laser-sharp line of tart elderberry, black-plum skins and black-cherry skins cut through the dark earth, tar and purple-flower elements. The palate blends approachable black raspberry, dark strawberry and muddled mulberry fruit with touches of coffee and dark cocoa.","Red","Syrah","US",103892
"39744","This is a wine that feels heavy, with rich apricot flavors that lack freshness and balance. It's not a wine for aging, but will go well with cakes or pastries.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",39744
"40192","Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors. Should you allow it to breathe, it rounds into a good (but still basic), semisoft and fruity red with solid cherry/berry flavors and nothing offputting.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",40192
"24843","Aromas of tilled earth, leather, game and spicy plum carry over to the palate with dried blueberry, ground pepper and a hint of licorice. Round but fleeting tannins provide easygoing support.","Red","Primitivo","Italy",24843
"45634","This feels slightly softer in the mouth than the massive 2006, but carries the density and gravitas that one associates with Quilceda Creek. Wonderful balance, with a deeply detailed set of flavors that gather strength as they move through the palate. Mixed berries, threaded with chocolate, lingering with black cherry, cassis, smoke, cedar, lead pencil and more.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45634
"58331","This is bone dry, with a tongue-tickling minerality underscoring floral highlights. The honeyed fruit flavors focus around peaches, with good length and a clean, fresh finish with gin-like, botanical complexity.","White","Viognier","US",58331
"77196","This wine is pulled from vineyards across the Columbia Valley, including Heather Hill, Bacchus, Dionysus, Ciel du Cheval and Destiny Ridge. A nuanced wine, it shows winemaker John Abbott in top form with its rich, layered fruit flavors, dazzling sense of texture and lengthy finish. It's drinking beautifully but promises to have a long life in front of it in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77196
"104893","Here's a ripe, pulpy Riserva with deep concentration and rich notes of spice, cigar box and black cherry. Great intensity and bright fruit flavors fill the mouth and last long on the finish. Pair this wine with beef stew or game meat.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",104893
"79236","Brisk acidity and a lean but smooth profile characterize this taut, somewhat tart wine.  A very inviting vouquet with cherry, cinnamon, clove, cedar, and tobacco notes sets a pretty stage for the palate, but after the great setup the wine delivers rather uninspired and predictable tart berry and sour cherry Barbera flavors.  The sour plum and earth finish is full but quite dry.","Red","Barbera","Italy",79236
"50595","Modest orange and peach flavors are found in this oak-tinged wine. It offers the Chardonnay lover good pleasure.","White","Chardonnay","US",50595
"28610","Blue fruit, raspberry, violet, dark chocolate, green olive and spice aromas lead to ripe fruit and herb flavors that mix in plenty of smoked-meat notes, heightened a dazzling feel. A lengthy finish caps it off. It's an intriguing wine that keeps you coming back for more.","Red","Syrah","US",28610
"1227","The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",1227
"103728","This ripe and spicy wine shows blackberry fruit and balanced wood aging. From selected parcels, it's still young and will need time. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",103728
"95767","This late harvest wine from Hungary is comprised of Furmint, Hárslevelu and Muscat. It has aromas of acacia flower and pear, with flavors of apricot, pear juice and dried rosemary. The finish is pleasantly sweet without being too cloying.","White","White Blend","Hungary",95767
"15358","Half Syrah and half Cabernet Sauvignon, with 40% new French oak, this wine draws you in with its notes of blackberries, milk chocolate and anise. It's broad and fleshy in feel, with abundant coffee and cherry flavors backed by ample acidity.","Red","Red Blend","US",15358
"6010","There's a lack of balance, with thin, slightly bitter fruit overriding any complexity that may have been achieved with more oak. This is not offensive, it just lacks character.","White","Chardonnay","US",6010
"43675","The apricot and star fruit aromas start out quite reticent, with barrel notes providing accents. The vanilla and stone fruit flavors are full in feel and walk together through the finish.","White","Roussanne","US",43675
"42216","The fresh, likeable Sebeka SB starts with lively lemon, gooseberry and tropical aromas, followed by rounded flavors of fresh citrus, tropical fruit and fig. An easygoing white that pairs well with spicy cuisine, seafood.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",42216
"102944","Broad spice and almond notes evident on the nose of this hearty Brunello are accented by cherry, bright blueberry and cassis. In the mouth, the wine shows enormous elegance and a silky, streamlined feel.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",102944
"56823","Bollini Pinot Grigio offers satisfying sensations of crisp lemon, stone fruit and melon. The wine is slightly sweet in the mouth and fills in the rear with pretty floral and fruit flavors. Pair it with finger foods and appetizers. With almost 200,000 cases made, this wine should be easy to locate.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",56823
"85611","A ripe wine with violet aromas and layers of ripe jammy berry flavors, this has robust tannins under the fruit, lending structure to its bold character. Acidity follows, adding a crisp texture to the aftertaste. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","Portugal",85611
"79504","This Basque Country white is quite particular and will not be to everyone's taste. Simple but fresh apple and apricot aromas are clean, while the palate is high in acidity, which is typical for the region. Flavors of blood orange and tangerine finish tart, bracing and angular.","White","White Blend","Spain",79504
"38385","Brambly aromas of leather, mint and berries lead to a fresh, fruity, pulpy palate with a jammy feel. Lightly herbal berry, plum and spice flavors finish with a touch of minty green.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",38385
"70801","Aromas of blackberry jam, stewed plum, raisin, roasted coffee bean and fig carry over to the palate along with a note of clove and orange zest. Fine-grained tannins and zesty acidity provide a firm elegant structure. Drink 2018–2024.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",70801
"63799","Aromas and flavors of fig, earth and mushroom characterize this wine, which is a little soft on the palate and grippy in a leathery texture. Full bodied and quite ripe, it has a juiciness of blackberry and depth of dark chocolate.","Red","Zinfandel","US",63799
"100823","Honeyed aromas of wheat bread and stone fruits are not as convincing as the wine's citrus, melon and honey flavors, which are supported by a full almost-sticky body. A creamy, chunky finish, like the palate, pulls up short of sticky.","White","Riesling","Chile",100823
"42468","Made with 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Sangiovese and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of black cherry, leather and green bell pepper. The firm palate shows mature plum, vanilla and cedar alongside tightly wound tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",42468
"96155","A light touch of cedar meets with black raspberry on this somewhat simple table wine. It's light and easy to quaff on the palate, with tangy dark red fruit but not much complexity, making it a great pizza wine.","Red","Red Blend","US",96155
"8371","Aromas of espresso, French oak, blackberry and exotic spice lead the way. The firm palate offers raw black cherry, coconut and oak-driven spice alongside racy acidity and fine-grained tannins. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean.","Red","Barbera","Italy",8371
"49103","Made from 100% Sangiovese, this opens with a lovely floral fragrance of violet and iris. Ripe sour cherry dominates the palate accented by toasted notes and black pepper. Even though it's not complex, the juicy fruit and smooth tannins make this friendly and delicious.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",49103
"8770","This is a soft, rather unfocused, open-textured wine that shows apple and citrus flavors. It's ready to drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",8770
"99695","Berry aromas are jammy and sweet smelling. This feels chunky and bit out of shape. Herbal boysenberry flavors come with a green core, while mint, spice, heat and herbal flavors carry the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",99695
"95629","Baked apple and baking spice aromas lead to a lightly creamy palate capped off by a tart, lemony finish. It provides a lot of appeal.","White","Chardonnay","US",95629
"31945","For a Bordeaux rosé, this is an unusual blend with 80% Cabernet Franc. That gives the wine its fine perfumed character and light touch of tannin. It makes for a fresh attractive wine that is drinkable now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",31945
"77214","This blend of DuBrul and Meek vineyard fruit broods with aromas of dark raspberries and licorice. Ripe fruit flavors accompany exquisitely balanced tannins and acidity. It's drinking well now but should have a long life in front of it.","Red","Merlot","US",77214
"104412","This is lightly oaked, with pleasant Chardonnay flavors of oranges, limes and mangoes. However, it's too sweet, with a sugary finish that makes it cloying.","White","Chardonnay","US",104412
"88617","Opaque purple in color, the nose smells equally dark, boasting integrated aromas of blackberry, cedar, graphite and charred sugar. Full bodied with tight tannins, the palate still manages to show some finesse, plus dried herb, mineral and cocoa inflections.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",88617
"1686","Very rich in texture while also balanced, this is a wine that shows extreme concentration—honey, yellow fruits and final sugar all wrapped in lively acidity.","White","Riesling","Austria",1686
"16115","From a vineyard called Sweetwater, this Riesling itself is sweet in peach, pineapple and wildflower honey flavors. Brisk Monterey acidity balances, with a tart, prickly mouthfeel.","White","Riesling","US",16115
"25826","Aromas of citrus blossom, chamomile and a whiff of tropical fruit waft out of the glass. The lively, delicious palate offers ripe white peach, apricot, pear, chopped herb and a light mineral note alongside bright acidity.","White","Vermentino","Italy",25826
"98757","This wine is ripe in strawberry-raspberry notes. It's lush and velvety, with a richness that will appeal to those who like a hint of decadence in their Pinot. Round and soft, with a bite of earthiness throughout, it brightens with a trace of minerality on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98757
"65557","This is mulchy on the nose, with a compost aroma muddling up the red-fruit component. It feels lean and scouring, with cranberry, tart raspberry and vanilla flavors. The finish is fragmented and stalky.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",65557
"9998","Plum, truffle, tilled earth and a hint of mocha lead the nose while the ripe, round palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and pipe tobacco. Velvety tannins support the savory flavors and carry through to the chewy, licorice finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",9998
"17221","This wine is tenacious in its grassy mix of pea shoots and gooseberry, interwoven with acidity that takes on a tartness that's not entirely pleasant.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",17221
"8782","With sugary, jellied flavors of cherry and berry, along with abundant oak-derived notes of sweet buttered toast and vanilla-cream, this is easy to drink.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8782
"55464","This wine opens with an assertively spiced bouquet of gingered white-peach tea, orange blossom, honeysuckle and toasted almond. The palate offers more fruity character in flavors of ripe stone fruit and citrus, but it's still dominated by spicy notes of ginger, clove, anise and honeycomb. Drink now.","White","Viognier","South Africa",55464
"76180","This medium-bodied, silky-textured wine lacks some of the positive green notes typical of Marlborough, but makes up for it with ample stone fruit, gooseberry and red currant aromas and flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",76180
"22656","For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",22656
"100138","Made entirely with Nebbiolo grown in the mountain vineyards of northeastern Italy, this opens with enticing aromas of wild rose, bright berry and Alpine herbs. The polished, structured palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, exotic spice, vanilla bean and toasted oak. Firm, silky tannins provide structure. Drink through 2024.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",100138
"100609","Estate grown and bottled, this affordable Pinot Noir brings light fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. Tannins are dry and the finish carries a hint of bourbon barrel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100609
"72175","Sweet caramel, a touch of mintiness, and some earth-tinged cassis grace the nose. That's followed up by simple fruit flavors and a corpulent mouthfeel held together by some light tannins on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",72175
"33775","Just beautiful, a dry, silky Pinot Noir, filled with complex flavors of cherries and black raspberries. Oak adds lovely notes of sweet char, and the natural acidity of the Santa Maria Valley shines through. Now–2014.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33775
"66818","This interesting blend of 73% Sauvignon Blanc, 20% Viognier and 7% Grenache Blanc shows passionfruit, jasmine, cherimoya and green pluot aromas on the nose. The palate offers riper yellow fruit and a graphite minerality, but not much complexity beyond that.","White","White Blend","US",66818
"8264","High alcohol is giving this 100% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8264
"103715","Aromas of boysenberry and barrel spice are followed by ripe pleasing purple-fruit flavors. The tannins deliver a light squeeze. It's hard to find the variety exactly, but it still brings appeal.","Red","Merlot","US",103715
"37045","Baked plum, smoked pork, red currant and fresh oregano show on the clean nose of this blend of 53% Grenache, 31% Syrah and 16% Mourvèdre. Baked strawberry, boysenberry and red currant show on the palate at first, but it quickly evolves into dried flowers and extra spicy vanilla, all framed by a tarry tension and biting acidity.","Red","G-S-M","US",37045
"89880","This is a solid showing, with aromas of toasted, buttered almond, honeyed pineapple, white peach flesh, apple and white flowers. It's light on the palate, with apple juice flavors, a touch of guava and nice chalkiness, making for a pleasant, drinkable wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",89880
"87155","A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of raisinated cherries, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of barnyard. Medicinal flavors are backed by chalky tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",87155
"22172","What a nice Merlot, Brander's best yet. It's easy to drink now for the rich array of cherries, currants, cola, smoked meat and cedar, brightened with brisk acidity. But give it an hour or two in the decanter to soften and mellow.","Red","Merlot","US",22172
"94089","The continuing improvement at classed growth Camensac under the ownership of the Merlaut family (Chasse-Spleen, Citran, etc) is apparent even in the lesser vintage of 2007. The structure hangs well with the stalky but solid black berry fruit, the acidity a pure streak through it. Age over 4–5 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",94089
"8349","Murrieta's blend of 31% Sauvignon Blanc, 27% Viognier, 15% Sémillon, 11% Pinot Blanc, 8% Orange Muscat and 8% Muscat Canellii is well-made and likable, medium-thick and somewhat sweet in style with citrus and almond accents. Delightfully quaffable.","White","White Blend","US",8349
"19448","Notes of Turkish delight and peach immediately signal opulence. The palate follows up with distinct sweetness that underlines the rich rose and peach flavors even more. There is an edge of freshness, but only just. Yet the palate is intense and pervaded by peach. Whether this is about intensity or sweetness will depend entirely on the food it is paired with.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",19448
"85625","A light rendition of the variety given time in bottle to mellow, this is a stand-out wine redolent of black olive, fig and gamy, sanguine meat. Delicately peppered, it slowly unravels its layers of blueberry and cherry fruit, complementing its savory register of flavor.","Red","Syrah","US",85625
"90311","This boasts thick, sun-drenched notes of mature fruit, intense spice and moist earth. The wine's nose is slightly stewy in essence and has some medicinal qualities on the finish. Drink it with pasta and ground beef ragù.","Red","Merlot","Italy",90311
"52178","This is a ripe, creamy wine with fresh currant and ripe peach fruits. It is lightly tangy, although its main strength is the refreshing fruitiness. Bright and crisp at the end, it is ready to drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",52178
"20829","Sweet, floral aromas of plum, candied berry and sugar beet are friendlier than the palate, which is a bit piercing and high in acidity. Cherry and tart plum flavors finish with choppy, bright acids and citric flavors.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",20829
"94772","No punches are pulled on this hedonistic wine with its aromas and flavors of blackberry, chocolate and barrel spice. It's rich and high octane but maintains a sense of balance.","Red","Syrah","US",94772
"76444","Is this the best Cabernet that Viu Manent has ever bottled? We think it very well might be; the wine is midnight madness, meaning it's dark as night and richly draped with blackberry, cassis, black plum and overall lushness. It's a hulk of a wine, with jammy fruit, fine tannic structure and handsome shadings. Drinkable now and probably better over the next two or three years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",76444
"95941","Von Schubert bottled two eisweins from the Herrenberg in 2009. This one is pale in color, with intense pineapple and honey flavors. The wine is sweet, luscious and viscous yet never cloying, with a long finish that features unfolding layers of fruit flavor.","White","Riesling","Germany",95941
"99829","This is a structured rich wine. It has great ripe fruit, generous with red berry and acidity in fine balance. It has a solid backbone of tannins although these are already well integrated into the opulent wine. Drink from 2021.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",99829
"53048","Colombo is based in the northern Rhône, but ventured down to the south to make this wine, a blend of 45% Syrah, 35% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre. Leather, dark-skinned plums and mocha mark the palate, which is firmly tannic yet without much hidden richness. Drink it with rare meats over the short term.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",53048
"52192","Lemon grass, underripe pineapple and freshly mowed lawn lead to tastes of grapefruit pith and white flowers. It has a strong backbone of minerality and a very slight sweetness on the finish.","White","White Blend","Moldova",52192
"86733","Unripe green notes of leaves detract from this wine's enjoyment. It's crisp in acidity, with some pure Meyer lemon, lime and fig flavors, but that vegetal note is bothersome.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",86733
"28716","This wine leads with lovely touch of flint, accentuating its green pear and lemon zest aromas. On the palate, it's light and dry, with a phenolic character that lends both texture and structure, adding complexity to all the freshness.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",28716
"16892","Black plum, prune and vanilla show on the slightly metallic nose of this bottling. There is decent richness to the sip, with gingerbread spice and black-cherry flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",16892
"19121","Sweet and candied on the nose, it has a touch of citrus and melon to the flavor profile. It has an okay mouthfeel.","White","Moscato","Argentina",19121
"70337","Fresh and blossomy, this elegant medium-bodied rosé offers loads of raspberry fruitiness, but also a deeply mineral spine of chalk and sea breeze. Made predominantly from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it holds smaller proportions of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay that lend complexity and nuance.","Rosé","Rosé","US",70337
"1166","This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines.","White","Viognier","US",1166
"25391","This is the second wine of Château Balestard, and there are suggestions of high extraction and very ripe fruit. It does have balance, however, the black fruits need time to calm down. The acidity is all here, offering freshness to this rich wine.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",25391
"56877","Subtle aromas of minerals, rose petal and red berry are not overdone. In the mouth, it has astringency, hard tannins and an overall narrow feel. Flavors of raspberry and red plum seem sharp and jagged, while oaky mint and heat rise up on the finish. Give this more bottle time and it may improve.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",56877
"21827","Defined by its voluptuous body, this wine is also elegantly accented in salted honey and lemon peel, complex and savory on the palate. The finish is marked by ripe apple and juicy acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",21827
"20920","Although the aromas are sweet, oozing with pear nectar, stone fruit, dried spices and apple blossoms, this wine features only 1.5% residual sugar. It's fairly big for a Finger Lakes Riesling, with a slightly oily texture, and comes across as being close to dry thanks to firm acids on the finish. The only problem with this wine is its limited availability.","White","Riesling","US",20920
"95991","The winery's larger offering from several vineyard sites, this wine is designed entirely to please, offering a seductively juicy abundance in black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon. Approachable and full bodied, the tannins are soft and the oak well integrated, allowing the earthy aromas and spicy brown-sugar elements to roam free.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95991
"52832","This wine is sharp and minty, with wintergreen flavors accompanying the riper blackberry and currant. That tartness gives this blend of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon a dry bite. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","US",52832
"60977","This wine is bold and full bodied, big enough for a grilled steak, with powerful ripe fruit flavors like black cherry and blackberry. Firm-enough tannins add grip to the texture, with slightly smoky, peppery accents on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60977
"55100","Pastry notes of caramel, vanilla and mint chocolate are the lead aromas of this Cabernet Franc, but savory touches of wood smoke and thyme surface with air. Fine, tight tannins grab at the back end of the medium-bodied  palate before finishing with a sanguine-like tang.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",55100
"40467","The Tasca family shows a deft hand with Cabernet Sauvignon, and has worked hard to match this international variety to the unique Sicilian territory. This beautiful vintage opens with nicely ripened dark fruit, cola, root beer, cured meat and Teriyaki sauce. The wine's texture is polished, smooth and firm.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",40467
"67084","A lavish oak component makes this full-bodied wine very aromatic—smoke, black pepper, cardamom—and also adds a spicy accent to the bold, ripe fruit flavors. The rich texture feels velvety in the mouth, and the spicy oak and potent fruit notes echo on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",67084
"84142","From the use of the term Shiraz (rather than Syrah) to the sweet, vanilla-and-tobacco-laden flavors, this seems to be aimed squarely at the consumer who loves a forward, round and rather soft Australian-style wine. It delivers ripe berry flavors, silky tannins and plenty of up-front pleasure for the price.","Red","Shiraz","US",84142
"6632","Crisp citrus aromas and fresh lemon and grapefruit flavors define this medium-bodied, appetizing and unapologetic wine. With lots of personality, a tingly texture and tangy finish, it's just the thing for appetizers and first courses.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",6632
"56704","Lean and racy, typical of the Saar even at these high ripeness levels, with hints of slate and mint or tea gracing pineapple fruit. The long, vibrant finish is crisp and mouthwatering, with the residual sugar dropping into the background. Drink now-2030+.","White","Riesling","Germany",56704
"26022","With considerable botrytis, this wine is intense and rich. It's still tight at this stage, structured with layers of spice and fruit. Drink from 2021.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",26022
"102286","For those who want classically grassy and energetic Sauv Blanc flavors, this widely available bottling is perfect. Aromas of both boisterously tropical fruit and funky cut grass lead into a zingy palate of white pepper, bell pepper, cement and lime.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",102286
"57986","The aromas offer notes of red fruit, spice and green wood, seeming hot. The cranberry and raspberry flavors are elegant and bring a better sense of balance, though the wood pokes out.","Red","Primitivo","US",57986
"98385","Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated.","White","Chardonnay","US",98385
"13767","This 100% Cabernet is a good wine, rich in blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors, and the tannins show that famous Stags Leap “iron fist in a velvet glove” quality. It seems a little hollow in the midpalate, reminiscent of the 2006 and 2007 vintages. Drink now–2017.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",13767
"55119","A touch of mushroom and vegetable unripeness runs through this Pinot. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it does interfere with your enjoyment of the fruit. Drink this silky, dry wine now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55119
"456","Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",456
"65648","The distinctive nose on this wine shows charred beef, concentrated cola, sweet blackberry jelly, black olive and chopped weeds, the last element reminiscent of a day spent gardening. The flavors are sanguine with bloody meats, showing a touch of dark red cranberry fruit and pepper on finish.","Red","Syrah","US",65648
"51022","From the most southerly of the Grand Cru vineyards, this wine is firm and tightly structured. Its wood aging shows in its toasty, spicy character that will integrate as the wine ages. Its rich yellow fruit and taut acidity suggest it will taste best from from 2021.","White","Chardonnay","France",51022
"55578","Attractive notes of dried red berry and bramble mingle with hints of savory herb and soft peppery spice on the bouquet of this blend. Skin-driven fruit flavors dominate the palate, followed by a clean finish. A blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon; Mevushal.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Israel",55578
"13551","The aromas explode with notes of potpourri, olive, smoked meat, fire pit, orange peel, mineral, mushroom, garrigue and white pepper. The palate is lifted, bright but intensely flavored, loaded with flower, berry, olive and charcuterie flavors. The finish seems near endless and the sense of balance is exquisite. It's shockingly good.","Red","Grenache","US",13551
"48828","Almost blue-black in color with a red-violet rim, this Syrah presents aromas of blackberry, mocha and a hint of green pepper. Simultaneously refreshing and well-rounded, it has pleasant flavors of blackberry, orange rind and chocolate-covered espresso bean.","Red","Syrah","Turkey",48828
"31428","Produced from organically grown grapes, this soft wine has red fruits that miss much definition, only hinting at some stalky acidity. It is ready to drink.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",31428
"63462","A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63462
"102702","There is a touch of sour berry on the bouquet, with white almond and menthol notes. The mouthfeel is subdued and silky.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",102702
"63045","Giribaldi's Barbaresco is smoky and warm with layered tones of exotic spice, cola, leather, tobacco and leftover espresso grinds. It has gritty, earthy, hands-on appeal thanks to what can best be described as rustic charm (it is aged two years in traditional oak casks). Drink it with boiled meats and mint sauce.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",63045
"9259","This Verdejo is in its late stages of life but it's hanging in there. Mostly neutral aromas of apple and lime set up a palate with citrusy acidity that keeps the wine alive. Narrow, simple flavors of orange and nectarine finish pithy but true to the variety. Drink immediately.","White","Verdejo","Spain",9259
"83226","Initially closed, this wine soon reveals a crisp, zesty texture and flavors of citrus and green apple. With its minerally character, Mâcon-Fuissé is a sort of poor man's Pouilly-Fuissé, although it often shows more softness.","White","Chardonnay","France",83226
"61909","This wine is equal parts Dineen (Yakima) and Patina (Walla Walla) vineyard fruit. Aromas of blue plum, savory herb and peppery spices lead to light elegant flavors that provide enjoyment.","Red","Syrah","US",61909
"89948","This deep ruby-colored wine has a bouquet of black cherry with hints of smoked meat and red bell pepper. Flavors of smoked meat and cherry pie with notes of orange peel never completely coalesce. There are some pleasant moments on the palate, but they don't all come together at the same time.","Red","Syrah","Israel",89948
"86521","Creamy earthiness joins the yellow stone fruit on nose and palate, making for a toned-down but full-fruited, generously rounded Gewurztraminer. The structure provided by pithy, pleasantly bitter notes leaves a lasting, refreshing impact.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",86521
"73939","This is an excellent vintage for this cuvée, showing great concentration of fruit. It's a generous mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, with the depth of preserves, but not the jammy character. Perfectly buoyed with zippy acidity, and finished with a lightly toasty edge, this is a lovely bottle.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73939
"97563","Appley and fresh with hints of white peach and blossoms on the nose and palate, this is a straightforward yet well-made Pinot Grigio that's hard to resist for under $10. Snappy and clean with brisk acidity and a pretty green floral finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Romania",97563
"66717","This is the best Pinot Noir yet from the Drouhin estate; immensely concentrated and rich. The fruit is complex and penetrating, focused and long, layered throughout a generous and extended finish. Cherries and chocolate linger on the palate, resonating long after the wine has been swallowed.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66717
"46027","The quality of Casarena's wines range from excellent to not great, with all points in between represented. This Malbec-led blend is heavy and raisiny on the nose, then syrupy in the mouth, with flavors running straight to candied and flat.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Argentina",46027
"88279","One of Temecula's pioneering vintners, Phil Baily takes his balanced wines seriously. This bottling shows lots of damp earth, black olive, concentrated mulberry, dried herbs and cardamom on the nose. Stewed black-cherry fruit meshes with Indian spice and well-integrated tannins on the palate that is built for aging.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88279
"50506","In an oxidative style, this is a wine that is smooth and full of ripe fruit tones. With black plum and berry flavors it has just enough of a tannic edge, with a soft aftertaste.","Port","Port","Portugal",50506
"8585","A solid effort, fruity in blackberries, currants and oak, with a smooth mouthfeel. Not especially complex, but a polished wine for drinking now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8585
"17454","Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",17454
"67348","Thick on the nose in black pepper and garrigue, this wine is velvety in layers of berry and cherry, with a hearty tobacco chaser. Concentrated and duly ripe, it brightens in the glass to show compelling bursts of white pepper and violet.","Red","Syrah","US",67348
"22795","Loaded with raspberry, cherry, cola, raisin and spice flavors, this Zinfandel is useful for pairing with barbecue. A nice Reuben sandwich will also star. The wine is rustically likeable.","Red","Zinfandel","US",22795
"35015","This shows oxidation and nuttiness on a pulpy, fleshy, cheesy-smelling bouquet. As Chardonnay goes, this is heavy and breaks down on the palate. Flavors of orange and mango finish wheaty and oxidized.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",35015
"97156","Intense aromas recall forest floor, tobacco, dark berry and grilled herb. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, black pepper and balsamic notes alongside big, brooding tannins. The warmth of alcohol shows on the midpalate.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",97156
"23058","From Montalcino's most famous vineyard site, this opens with aromas of cured meat, grilled herb and a whiff of mature olive. The palate offers red cherry, licorice, savory herb and a mineral note alongside youthfully assertive but fine-grained tannins that need time to unwind. Drink after 2018.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",23058
"66872","Aromas of wood shop and anisette dominate the nose. The palate is evolved, offering prune, pomegranate, vanilla, oak extract and roasted coffee bean but no fruit richness.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",66872
"32744","Aromas of ripe black cherry, strawberry compote and baking spice lead the way while the easygoing palate offers crushed raspberry and hint of white pepper. Dusty tannins provide light support.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",32744
"20879","Bright, soft and attractively fruity, this is an easy, open wine. An edge of acidity and minerality give the wine a good, crisp texture. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",20879
"103754","From a single block at Temperance Hill, this aromatic wine neatly captures the terroir without pushing too hard. There are herbal nuances. a hint of hazelnut, some earth and wet stone, all nicely blended into a wine that is robust but accessible. Good balance and well-managed tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103754
"22601","Here's a simple, brambly expression of Sangiovese Grosso, with bright acidity and lively notes of forest berry and moist earth. This wine has a smoky touch of toasted almond on the close.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",22601
"12805","Riper aspects of Mirabelle plum join the aromatic spectrum dominated by bracing citrus zest. Grapefruit and lemon echo along the palate and surpass themselves in a tight, bracing and concentrated finish. Slender but ultratoned.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",12805
"32626","Fresh-pressed boysenberries give zest to dusty aromas of tobacco and strong shoe leather on the nose of this bottling. Tobacco shows powerfully on the palate, as do dill, marjoram and black pepper. Dark fruit, from blackcurrant to elderberry, provides the base.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",32626
"52285","Bright and fruity, this crisp and fresh wine is full of lively red currants and berries cut with acidity and a tangy, orange peel texture. This is a great summer rosé.","Rosé","Rosé","France",52285
"4842","This is a full-bodied, ripe wine, moderate in acidity, that reveals a wealth of baked plum and cinnamon in the glass. Along the way it meets a pine forest of savory companionship, finishing in youthful tannin.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4842
"79931","A yeasty funk still hovers over this richly flavored wine: there are hints of Bosc pear, of miso and white pepper. The palate is taut and bright with lime and lemon zest and has ample concentration. From Vienna itself it explains that capital's enduring love affair with Grüner.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",79931
"43488","While this may not be the strongest Clos de Sixte the Jaume family has made, it's still a very good effort. The red fruit aromas and flavors seem slightly confectionary, but carry enough pie-cherry flavors to see them through, backed by hints of dark chocolate. The tannins are supple, turning to a cocoa-powder texture on the crisp finish. Drink now–2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",43488
"89568","Other than notes of white flowers and green herbs on the nose, this wine is all about canned peas and beans. The palate has texture and flesh, but the flavors are vegetal.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",89568
"99097","This wine comes from one of Côtes de Provence historic cru classé estates. It is a ripe and smooth wine with crisp acidity and a fine bite of spice. The wine is packed with red fruits and finished with refreshing acidity.","Rosé","Rosé","France",99097
"6302","In this powerful, full-bodied wine, soft fruit accompanies the firm tannins. The wine is already well integrated, showing dense red fruits as well as structure. A touch of wood will soften soon. Drink from 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",6302
"101507","Inviting aromas of violet and ripe red-skinned berry take center stage in this wine. The lively, full-bodied palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and cinnamon flavors framed by velvety tannins and zesty acidity. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Barbera","Italy",101507
"52951","Soft black raspberry and cherry notes struggle for expression on the nose. Light and easy in the mouth, the wine is balanced but lacking a bit of heft and structure.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",52951
"27706","High alcohol, softness and tremendously ripe fruit combine to craft a wine of heady opulence. With raspberry and cherry pastry, chocolate fudge and anise liqueur flavors, it's almost a dessert wine, except that the finish is dry.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",27706
"65339","Blurred edges characterize the non-distinct apple fruit. The palate has edges of bitterness that the residual sugar cannot masks.","White","Pinot Gris","France",65339
"14496","Berry aromas come with an oaky, lactic whiff of plastic. A scratchy palate is fruity but awkward, with generic plum and dark-berry flavors. Fig cookie and chocolaty flavors control a blocky finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",14496
"21759","You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",21759
"6691","This is a fruity wine, gentle with its white fruits and citrus flavors. It has just a touch of minerality from the granite soil that brings out acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink this refreshing wine now.","White","Melon","France",6691
"15799","Sweeter whiffs of milk chocolate, baking spice and graham cracker accenting black fruit on the nose are replaced by more herbaceous tones of herb and bramble on the palate of this red blend. It's a juicy intensely ripened wine with brisk acidity and bold penetrating tannins on the finish. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Red Blend","US",15799
"63412","This has a strong animal aroma, although the palate is all fruit and fragrant acidity. It shows nutmeg and cinnamon spice from wood aging, as well as a strongly herbal character. Drink from 2018. The wine is 80% Sauvignon Blanc, 15% Sauvignon Gris and 5% Sémillon.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",63412
"33348","This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.","White","Chardonnay","US",33348
"14686","An interesting white wine, with crisp acidity and dry flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, lemons, limes and white flowers. If you can't tell what variety it is, that's because it's a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier.","White","White Blend","US",14686
"46372","With the majority of the fruit from the producer's Calistoga and Oakville estate vineyards, as well as its Healdsburg property, this is a dry, citrus-laden wine, zesty and refreshing in lime and grapefruit. The acidity is dialed high, yet remains balanced by the density of fruit and body, the overall effect just right in terms of ripeness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",46372
"90085","This pruney, baked and somewhat sour blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents itself as overly ripe.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",90085
"104497","This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese. At first tight, spicy and herbal, it then blossoms with dark, deep juicy black fruits. The finish is long and trim, bringing in more complexity, with coffee, cassis and espresso. Drink now through 2025.","Red","Red Blend","Canada",104497
"102693","This is a powerful wine, almost too powerful for its own good, with forward citrus, tropical fruit and vanilla-oak flavors.","White","Viognier","US",102693
"38877","This juicy and simple blend of 40% Merlot with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon offers chewy, dense tannins and a lingering spiciness of leather and tobacco.","Red","Red Blend","US",38877
"71314","This structured wine shows firm tannins as well as plenty of black fruit. At the same time, it has a sense of balance and elegance, as well as crispness that counteracts the ripe, juicy fruit. The wine is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",71314
"21922","Delicious and easy to drink, the wine carries rich, ripe flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries, brown sugar, vanilla and toast. At the equivalent of $5.75 for a regular bottle, it's a great value.","Red","Shiraz","US",21922
"61684","This ripe, strawberry-flavored blend of Touriga Nacional, Aragonez and Merlot is soft and smooth. It is rounded with an almost-sweet fruitiness. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",61684
"27152","Faint scents of pressed flower and grass grace the yellow apple, green melon and lime peel core. The medium-weight palate is clean and easy, with flavors of apple and citrus that are attractive but fade quickly. Drink now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",27152
"86500","Juicy, appetizing apple notes rise from the glass, helped along by summer blossom and rose. The off-dry palate is generous with ripe peach and plum accented by pleasantly bitter notes of pith. The tiniest amount of spritz helps to keep things fresh.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",86500
"72237","This outgoing and full-bodied wine has a lot going for it. Fruity, enticing aromas lead to fully ripe flavors that suggest plums and fresh strawberries, with a suave and supple texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72237
"26220","Ostentatiously ripe, this full-bodied wine hardly hides its richness. It's generous and packed with fruitiness. The acidity and the tighter texture are backdrops to this great burst of fruit. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",26220
"69978","Lots of acidity and steel in this bone-dry Chard. Also, pronounced toasty oak, with a butterscotch and caramel taste dominating. Fortunately there's a good underpinning of peach, pear and pineapple fruit.","White","Chardonnay","US",69978
"55530","Grapey, with an off-putting scent of alcohol mixed with tire rubber. Beyond that, the cola and menthol aromas are pleasant, with chocolate and orange peel underneath. It’s hefty, chunky and plummy in the mouth, with lots of sweet oak running onto the finish, leaving a long and lasting woody impression. 164 cases made.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55530
"101178","A pretty pale salmon color is matched by aromas of strawberry and herbs that are light and delicate. The palate brings the suggestion of sugar with an elegant styling.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",101178
"17133","Lovely, light, fresh and delicate, this Barbera is young, juicy and appealing. The fruit mixes light berry flavors with tart, tangy acids; the flavors seem to gather in the mid-palate, showing excellent concentration. No new oak is evident, nor is it missed. The alcohol remains comfortably below 14%, and the fruit is light but quite ripe, with no green edges.","Red","Barbera","US",17133
"104900","This seductive Brunello portrays aromas of black fruit, vanilla, brown sugar, plums and prunes wrapped within a thin veil of smoke. It's a wine that reaches a comfortable level of intensity and balance and that offers mouth-puckering flavors of sour cherry on the finish.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",104900
"74173","There's nice restraint on the nose of this judiciously priced bottling by the Delicato group, with lemon-lime citrus and slightly green apple flesh on the nose. The wine is strongly textural once sipped, with sour apple, lime peel and riper stone fruit in the background, finishing grippy and clean.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",74173
"95911","This white blend of Gros Manseng and Petit Courbu, both local grapes for Saint-Mont, produces a ripe, floral wine with touches of honey. It is refreshing as well, with lime juice acidity that sails right through to the end.","White","White Blend","France",95911
"48907","Winemaker Mike Lee continues to prove his prowess with Sauvignon Blanc in this latest vintage of Patianna, Patti Fetzer's line of organically farmed wines from outside of Hopland in Mendocino County. Fermented entirely in stainless steel without undergoing ML or barrel aging, it delivers everything you love about the variety, inviting one in with melon and minerality, then following through with a surprising creaminess and almost decadent, mousse-like finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",48907
"3456","Whiffs of smoke and dark-roast coffee meander pleasantly amid crisp red cherry and berry flavors in this brisk but full-bodied red blend. The palate is lean but elegantly concentrated, finishing on a refreshingly herbal tone.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",3456
"24872","This wine is full and richly fruity. It has a cool feel to it from the proximity of the vines to the ocean, which gives a mineral, crisp character that adds tang to the texture. Acidity lifts the ripe fruit, allowing it to age a few more months. Drink from late 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",24872
"25027","A southern Rhône-style blend based on Mourvèdre, this blush wine is crisp and clean, with raspberry and spice flavors, but it's too sweet for a table wine.","Rosé","Rosé","US",25027
"21877","Freshly buttered toast with a thin coating of marmalade comes to mind when sniffing this wine that also shows a touch of cinnamon and Meyer-lemon juice on the nose. The riper, rounded palate offers yellow apples dipped in caramel, sea salt and cinnamon, which pops again on the back end.","White","Chardonnay","US",21877
"57073","Restrained lemon and apple aromas are accented by bramble on this crisp, light-bodied Riesling. It's delicate in concentration but its bracing lemon-lime acidity refreshes. Drink now through 2018.","White","Riesling","US",57073
"83027","This is bottled in one of those tall, thin Alsace-type bottles, and while it's technically a dry table wine, it could almost be a dessert wine. There's a sugary edge to the peach, pineapple, honey and wildflower flavors. With crisp acidity, the wine is basically off-dry.","White","Viognier","US",83027
"2421","Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",2421
"65593","This is a bright wine—still a little closed but promising fine fruitiness for the future. With herbal acidity, lemon and grapefruit flavors and a zesty tang at the end, it will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2020.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",65593
"46755","A blend of 50/50 Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a rich, spicy and perfumed wine. Layers of wood aging accompany ripe blackberry fruits and dark tannins. The texture is dense and dark, still developing. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",46755
"10032","Fleshy red currant on the nose turns into denser, less focused red fruit on the palate. This is simple, medium-boded and fruit driven. Drink now for its freshness.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",10032
"31981","Enticing aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, leather and a hint of baking spice meld together. The juicy, delicious palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and ground pepper. Firm, velvety tannins support the succulent fruit.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",31981
"19529","Simple and cloying in white sugar notes. Too bad, because there's good acidity and succulent citrus and tropical fruit flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",19529
"56993","Jammy apricot, orange, mango and vanilla bean flavors mark this simple but tasty Chardonnay. It has enough acidity to keep it from collapsing.","White","Chardonnay","US",56993
"359","This appealing blend of 50% Roussanne, 30% Grenache Blanc and 20% Clairette is tight and citrusy on the nose, broadening out on the palate to offer hints of apple, pineapple and underripe melon. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",359
"59121","This proprietary combination of 43% Roussanne, 43% Pinot Gris and 14% Viognier is creamy and robust, although it did not spend time in oak. Apple, apricot and an intensity of tart lemon make up the flavor characteristics, the body round and full.","White","White Blend","US",59121
"96041","Sourced from Red Willow, Olsen and Les Collines, this is the finest effort yet from Gramercy Cellars and one of the greatest Syrahs ever produced in Washington state. Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way.","Red","Syrah","US",96041
"68121","Vanilla, baked cherry and coconut aromas lead the nose. Bright and tense, the palate offers Marasca cherry, raspberry, vanilla and clove flavors, bolstered by firm acidity and youthfully austere tannins that leave a grippy finish. It needs to unwind and soften.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",68121
"22206","Rather lean aromas and spare fruit flavors meet more lavishly rich flavors for dual personalities in this medium-bodied, soft-textured and slightly sweet wine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22206
"19115","Richly fruited with sweet black cherries and cassis, this deeply penetrating Pinot Noir gets a lift on the palate with cool tones of pine, menthol and pencil lead. Lively acidity and soft, feathery tannins linger on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19115
"82209","This producer's light take on the variety continues to impress with this vintage. Anise and oak hints combine on the nose to invite one in for an elegant taste of bright, juicy acidity and refined lemon and green apple flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",82209
"68712","A soupy sort of wine with raisiny aromas. It tastes salty and feels astringent, with tomato, herb and brothy flavors. The mouthfeel is the best part.","Red","Syrah","Spain",68712
"44715","Flowery and textural, this is both concentrated and airy at the same time. It floats across the palate gracefully, the pretty fruit flavors of spiced pear and hints of honeydew are set up nicely by crisp, leesy acids. Good length and a fine, clean finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",44715
"47013","Very dark though not too viscous in the glass, this bottling of a rarely planted grape originally from Madiran in France shows pressed blackberry, dark chocolate and coffee touches on the nose. The palate balances blueberry and other purple fruits with mocha, black coffee and hoisin hints.","Red","Tannat","US",47013
"15199","Aged in just one-third new French oak, this mostly shows the fruit, along with notes of green herbs, plum and currant accented by vanilla. The palate is medium bodied, slightly viscous in feel with a tart finish and dry tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15199
"35010","This is a tough wine to love, although the price makes it an everyday sipper. With blackberry, licorice and herb flavors, it's dry and tannic.","Red","Red Blend","US",35010
"62794","Fresh and light in character, this fruity, crisp wine is up front with its bright character. Tight, fragrant and ready to drink, it is a simple wine that will be good as an apéritif.","White","Chardonnay","France",62794
"27220","This is a ripe Mencía with mild prune, raisin, fig and baked berry aromas. The palate is intense and shows major-league grip. Flavors of earthy, baked black fruits, wild herbs, dried black plum and chocolate finish long, toasty, spicy and serious. Drink through 2018.","Red","Mencía","Spain",27220
"18837","This is a wine for long-term aging, rich, wood-aged and seriously dense. Firm tannins, dark berry fruits and layers of wood extract come from 12 months in barrel. It has spice, acidity and a sense of brooding power. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",18837
"61587","Ripe blackberry and plum flavors resonate at the core of this big, full-bodied wine. It's a bit jagged in nature though, juggling contrasts of ripe fruit with sharp acidity. Soft, chalky tannins frame the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",61587
"104171","This yellow-looking Chardonnay smells briny and like oily popcorn. The palate is both watery in feel and resiny. Nutty, salty flavors of popcorn crowd out apple notes, while the finish is dilute.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",104171
"87395","Plump and meaty, this opens with dark aromas of blackberry, spice, crushed pepper and bresaola. This would drink well at informal occasions with family and friends.","Red","Syrah","Italy",87395
"103555","There's no denying this wine's stalky, oily aromas. In the mouth, this blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier is chunky, with flavors that follow suit: the palate is bitter, slightly oxidized and melony. For $40, not much is clicking here.","White","White Blend","Chile",103555
"88698","Bright, fresh fruit and dried herb aromas combine with lively but concentrated and tannic fruit flavors in this big but well-behaved wine. The texture balances lavishness with a bit of astringency in an attractive and appetizing way.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88698
"11508","This Amarone shows nearly overripe black fruit aromas, with just a hint of nail polish remover. The palate is better, delivering mature black cherry flavors accented by fennel, hay and raisin notes. Best to drink this soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",11508
"85297","Earthy berry, olive and latex aromas are sleepy and chunky. In the mouth, however, this is more grating and alive. Flavors of earthy, salty plum and raspberry finish similarly, with bold acidity, liveliness and a salty after­taste.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",85297
"3187","Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",3187
"95360","This wine has a restrained, elegant character that offers minerality and deep Chardonnay fruit on the palate. Aromas of lemon and spice on the nose are followed by full-bodied flavors and a toasted nut finish. Poised and pretty, it will pair well with most dishes.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",95360
"103991","The wine is pretty basic, with buttered toast, vanilla bean, brown sugar and juicy pineapple and orange flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",103991
"5475","The sister wine to Ruby Leigh, this Cabernet-based blend is sourced principally from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens with scents of violets and moves into a firm palate mixing cassis, herb and iron shavings. Excellent structure cellaring through 2025.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",5475
"23473","From the Predappio area of Romagna in central Italy, this Sangiovese offers rustic aromas of tar and licorice backed by black fruit and prune. There's a savory quality on the close with cured meat and tobacco.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",23473
"63225","Harsh red-berry aromas are strained. This feels flabby and clumsy, while weedy, medicinal berry flavors do nothing to elevate this shaky, hard-tannin Sangiovese.","Red","Sangiovese","Argentina",63225
"91705","Bold, thick and chewy, this masculine blend of Montepulciano and Cabernet Franc delivers lasting aromas of pipe tobacco, cinnamon, jammy blackberry and dried herb. The finish is driven by a soft, chocolate-fudge-like aftertaste.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",91705
"75729","This is a deliciously aromatic wine, bursting with bright fruits, acidity, all held together with a soft texture. The wine is easy to drink and ready now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",75729
"69907","Earthy compost and sage provide a rustic undertone to this well-made wine, dotted in cranberry, green tea and a hint of menthol. Medium bodied, it offers velvety texture and body within a graceful structure.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69907
"66009","Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and cocoa. The straightforward palate delivers ripe plum, vanilla and clove alongside close-grained tannins that clench the finish.","Red","Merlot","Italy",66009
"15464","This 100% varietal wine conveys notes of mortared green herbs, plum, cherry, medicine cabinet and vanilla. It's medium bodied with a supple, enticing feel. Baking spice, cherry and coffee flavors linger on the (very, very) long, coffee-filled finish. The aromas don't all come together but this wine is worth exploring for the remarkable finish, which is about as good as it gets.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15464
"38208","This is a rich, plush Cabernet, with a sense of elegance. It smells like prune, blackberry, coffee and toast. The concentrated palate boasts prune, olive, coffee and dark berry flavors. Drink or hold for a few years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",38208
"104557","This is a deliciously refreshing wine. It's acidity and red-currant fruits are bright, crisp and right up front. The rounder, caramel and spice backdrop to all this fruitiness makes it just right for the table.","Rosé","Rosé","France",104557
"102132","Hot and Porty, with baked cherry and chocolate flavors in a heavy texture. A Rhône blend based on Syrah.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",102132
"10635","Bright, soft and herbaceous, this has a touch of sweetness as well fresh fruit. Citrus and gooseberries abound with only the lightest structure to hold it together.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",10635
"74458","Slightly dusty, herbal notes distract from pleasant peach and strawberry flavors in this dry rosé made from Pinot Noir along with a splash of Chardonnay. It's delicate in concentration but refreshing on the palate.","Rosé","Rosé","US",74458
"50912","Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",50912
"14355","The delicacy of the cool Saar valley comes through wonderfully in this off-dry kabinett. Crushed-stone aromas lead the way, followed by zesty, citrusy flavors that elegantly interweave with mineral notes before lingering gracefully on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",14355
"44580","Notes of pollen and dusty mineral lend an earthy tone to pressed apple, peach and apricot flavors in this off-dry Riesling. Zesty lemon-lime acidity reverberates with intensity through the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",44580
"13017","This is a powerful wine, made to age for a long time, from this estate which is performing in top gear. Complex tannins and dark fruits both make their presence felt. It has weight, ripeness and a dense structure. A great success, it is unlikely to be ready to drink before 2027.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",13017
"59098","A Chardonnay that did not go through malolactic fermentation and was aged in 20% new French oak, this is bristling in acidity and crispness, with a suggestion of lemon and vanilla wafer on the palate. The finish remains crisp though abbreviated.","White","Chardonnay","US",59098
"41504","This shows rich blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that are wrapped into smooth, fine tannins, with a long, distinguished finish. It's a little warm in alcohol, but altogether this is a fine Cabernet for drinking now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",41504
"2272","The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.","Rosé","Rosé","France",2272
"4553","Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",4553
"13012","With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",13012
"79828","A normal five-barrel production was cut to two because of hail. This wine is firm, with hints of the generosity of the appellation waiting behind the dry texture. It's structured, with acidity and plum skins that will take some time. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",79828
"66209","This structured, smoky wine is also full of ripe berry fruit. It has a generous texture and a fine balance between fruit and tannins but is likely to age quickly. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",66209
"82493","This standout Amarone boasts elegant mineral tones of wet river stone and crushed granite, which are followed by softer layers of ripe fruit and spice. There's a savory note of soy sauce and cured meat, with a smoky barbecue overtone. Let this wine age 10 years or more.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",82493
"53539","A rich, ripe Chardonnay, with tons of buttered toast, tangerine jam and vanilla flavors. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",53539
"106083","Firm and chewy, this pure Syrah has plenty of punch (at 14.6% alcohol) but not much detail. A clean, crisp core of tangy berry is framed in large, dry, somewhat chalky tannins, and finishes with a hit of chocolate.","Red","Syrah","US",106083
"25318","Named after a local landmark, this is rich for a Vinho Verde, a soft blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura that brings out white fruits as well as a more citrus character. It's very aromatic, fruity and worth keeping a few months.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",25318
"52336","Fresh berry-salad aromas suggest tart, just-ripe summer fruits in this medium-bodied Shiraz filled with crunchy fruit. It's forward and smashable in the best sense, even if it's not profound.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",52336
"55983","Penetrating layers of white grapefruit and tangerine are laced with deliciously astringent murmurs of lime zest in this dry, citrusy Riesling. It's deeply fruity and forward, yet nuanced by savory hints of nuts and spice that linger long on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",55983
"995","Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",995
"90458","Tart, clean and juicy, this has ripe flavors of apricot, citrus, tropical fruit and spice. With zesty acidity, it feels basically dry, despite the honeyed finish. A touch of oak lends vanilla and smoke notes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",90458
"74527","Russet pear peel and flesh make for an inviting, appetizing nose. The palate is fresh and provides some yeasty, savory texture. There is ample freshness and lasting, yeasty spice. The finish is clean and very refreshing.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",74527
"28158","Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",28158
"1128","Slightly confected on the nose, showing cotton candy and bubble gum aromas, but you'll also find plenty of strawberry-raspberry flavors. Very fruity and clean, with a fresh finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",1128
"36358","A collaboration between winemaker James Foster and rockstar Pat Monahan of Train, this bottling shows black raspberry, pencil shavings and a feral animal-hide touch to the nose. The palate packs in a lot of licorice spice atop the heavy purple-fruit background.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36358
"48095","Tingling acidity keeps this wine fresh. It is an impressive Cab, blended with small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot, that's aged in French oak. Lively, the oak is soft and approachable, making room for the bright notions of dark cherry, cassis and vanilla that linger on the generous finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",48095
"25492","This is one of the most forward and accessible of Calera's new releases. It's superrich now in black cherry liqueur, mocha, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, a seductively silky wine that's a total hedonistic pleasure. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25492
"2391","This wine from Château Lagrézette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core. Blended with a small proportion of Merlot, there is just a touch of softness which will allow the wine to mature in the next 2–3 years.","Red","Malbec","France",2391
"48217","Slightly sweet and powdery smelling, with simple creaminess to the orange-influenced nose. The palate is solid and plump, with basic citrus flavors that shouldn't steer you wrong. Nice feel and a good but regular finish seal the deal.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",48217
"105017","Softly layered in integrated oak, this 100% varietal wine dances in raspberry, citrus and leather, with a touch of tar. Full bodied, it's a reserve-level wine that may open further in the bottle and glass.","Red","Syrah","US",105017
"94892","This makes a nice choice for your house white wine to buy by the case. Attractively rich, it seems to be all about the fruit flavor. It brings ripe pear and peach notes, an opulent texture and lingering fruity finish. It is medium-bodied, smooth and complete.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",94892
"35922","Multiple vineyards contribute to this standout blend. It feels open and accessible, yet carries the structure to age gracefully. You'll find interesting threads of freshly picked herb, lemon oil, pimiento and olive supporting citrus and fresh apple fruit.","White","Chardonnay","US",35922
"71074","This is a fine wine that performs at the level of a premier cru. It has brambly fruitiness and intense perfume. The structure is already finely integrated, allowing the strawberry fruit and acidity to shine through. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",71074
"84599","A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever. Approachable now, it should age well for 10–12 years at least.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",84599
"12918","This rich wine is already smoothly textured yet still has fine tannins that give aging potential. With its black fruit and acidity, it's ripe, smoky and likely to be very drinkable from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",12918
"106609","Full aromas of toasty oak, blackberry and vanilla feed into a saturated hard-pointed tartaric palate. Flavors of Christmas spice, oak and baked black fruits display hints of nutmeg and cola on a blocky hard finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",106609
"102007","Imagine aromas of the ripest pink grapefruit combined with beautiful floral notes. Then tropical fruit flavors chime in on the palate, which is satisfyingly full, yet not heavy. This is an intense and individualistic wine possibly best served as an apéritif. Editors' Choice.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",102007
"22779","Off-dry and direct in citrus, apricot, green apple and honey flavors, this easy-drinking wine is refreshed with crisp acidity. Good now as a cocktail sipper.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",22779
"19083","A full-bodied, flamboyant version of this benchmark bottling, the 2007 verges on too much, with lush tropical fruit framed by smoky notes and finishing spicy and slightly warm. Unlikely to have the longevity of the 2008, it's a bold, extroverted Chard ideal for drinking over the next year or two.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",19083
"55021","Brisk lemon peel and crushed mineral tones lend vibrance to this dry, full-bodied Gewürztraminer. Bright tangerine and lychee on the palate linger with a touch of earth and pollen on the finish. Drink now through 2019.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",55021
"74449","This is made to be a reserve-level wine, crafted from a combination of blocks within the famous vineyard. Succulent boysenberry and blackberry impress from first sip, before a juiciness of cherry and strawberry pile in. Expansive and powerful, with tremendous body and texture, it ends with a persistence of black pepper. Drink now through 2023.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",74449
"77959","An intensity of petrol-like oakiness on the nose of this wine suggests a youthful coiling that's yet to unravel. Still, plenty of promise is revealed, from robust yet floral elements of golden apple and honey to the effusive back notes of peach. Medium bodied, it finishes crisp and creamy, an expert combination of strength and elegance. Drink now through 2020.","White","Chardonnay","US",77959
"105778","Smoky aromas of burnt hickory accent prune and spice cake scents. This is yet another lush, ripe, deep Ribera del Duero from the excellent 2010 vintage. Flavors of mocha, wood spice, char, blackberry and spicy BBQ notes finish chocolaty, with herb and spice accents that add to the wine's complexity. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",105778
"13536","Lemon-jelly aromas give this a strange character. The fruit reflects the same artificial flavor. It is hard to see where it is going.","White","Chardonnay","France",13536
"20080","Here's a lush young Petite Sirah brimming with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur, dark chocolate and licorice flavors that taste a little sweet. It's tannic and immature now, but should age well for up to a decade.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",20080
"47652","This wine intrigues with its aromas of peppery spices, tobacco and purple fruit. The flavors are lush and focused, bringing a lot of hedonistic pleasure, though it trails a bit toward the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","US",47652
"17238","This tough wine seems light on fruit. It is hard and shows considerable extraction.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",17238
"18170","In a light, fresh style, this is an attractive red berry fruited wine. There are light tannins, soft strawberry flavors and a light acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",18170
"46419","Structured and savory, this polished wine doles out aromas and flavors of mature plum, crushed black cherry, violet, black pepper and clove. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",46419
"84747","Properly rustic, this has firm and dry tannins, a powerful structure to go with the wood aging and black plum flavor. It has pepper, spice and toast notes, with layers of acidity. The finish is very dry and firm. Screwcap.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",84747
"20828","This offers aromas of dill, wet leaves, hay, pickled beets, roasted coffee bean and spearmint. The palate lacks fruit richness, delivering instead espresso and vanilla-sweetened oak. Astringent tannins generate a tongue-drying finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",20828
"4493","A touch of dried apple skin and cinnamon stick open the nose of this hearty, red dessert wine. It presents tight tannins, with a sweet, chewy chocolate aftertaste.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",4493
"47095","Dust, pipe ash and pencil shavings give an Old World vibe to the nose. The palate offers very austere blackberry and soil flavors. Serve with pot roast or cigars.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47095
"9086","Scents of rose powder and petals come up first, followed by hints of cherries. Then the palate brings raspberries, with a sour-candy tanginess. The cleansing acids and overall balance are pitch perfect.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9086
"7863","This deeply flavored wine bursts forth with ripe blueberry, plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel is silky and succulent, wrapping the forward fruit into darker flavors laced with minty cacao, licorice and espresso. Drink now through 2026.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7863
"57925","This wine is rich, full of dark fruits and dusty tannins. It has a solid structure with ripe black fruits and concentration. Wood aging and a dry edge have given the wine a core that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",57925
"88233","Lovely aromas of marmalade, orange blossom, peach, honeysuckle and cantaloupe waft from the glass. These notes translate onto the palate, which is viscous and mouthcoating, yet balanced by a lifted acidity that preserves a lingering finish.","White","White Blend","US",88233
"64384","A brooding texture and fully layered concentration of intense flavor spark the palate and mind in this estate wine, which is showy in cola, bark, black cherry and black tea. Medium bodied and well-made, it finds balance between its coastal influence, its crisp acidity and the burlier aspects of fruit and weight.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64384
"97839","This straightforward blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah and Merlot opens with aromas of mature black fruit, graphite and dark baking spice. The palate offers prune, black currant and intense black pepper supported by tight tannins. Pair this with pizza or hearty  pasta dishes.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",97839
"3043","Cantina Tre Serre is a well-priced and informal Barbera with a thin and informal style backed by fruity freshness. There's even a tiny touch of effervescence that adds a perky and peppery sensation to the mouthfeel.","Red","Barbera","Italy",3043
"30517","A woody jammy nose is lush and borders on raisiny. Stout, saturated and thick on the palate, this Cabernet blend from Curicó deals a broad swipe of giant blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors. A chunky finish with rubbery tannins is tasty and lush, but a bit over the top.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",30517
"85221","This is almost as impressive as Gerin's La Champine Syrah, which is a tremendous achievement as Viognier seems much harder to do well. Hints of crushed stone and struck flint add nuance to the ripe apricot aromas, while the exotic, tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are reined in by a touch of citrus-pith bitterness. Drink now–2018.","White","Viognier","France",85221
"40013","No shrinking violet at 15.9% abv, La Folia's Zin is exuberant in juicy red and black fruit, cinnamon spice and a taste of cola. Inviting, full and round with a softness in the mouth, the finish slips away ever so quickly. It's otherwise a swell example of Sierra Foothills fruit.","Red","Zinfandel","US",40013
"44879","Aromatically stunning, with opulent, effusive aromas of lychee, honey, preserved peaches and spice cake. The palate has good acidity and a silky texture while the finish is long and dry. Try with a Vietnamese noodle dish. Drink now to 2011.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",44879
"84217","Made with Friulano, Pinot Bianco, Sauvignon, Malvasia and Ribolla Gialla, this structured white opens with enticing aromas of candied citrus zest, light oak, chopped herb and almond. The firm palate offers baked apple, nectarine, coconut, toast, vanilla and a confectionary note.","White","White Blend","Italy",84217
"86252","Reserved aromas of baked apple, cream and spice lead to medium-bodied and tart lemony flavors that stretch-out on the finish. It shows a pleasing sense of balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",86252
"79111","Slight in aroma at first, this wine slowly reveals a waft of lemon. It's light in flavor, and it delivers crispness, with a hint of oak on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",79111
"79441","This is a soft, ripe wine, full of fresh fruit. It is a warm blend of Aragonez and Cabernet Sauvignon, balancing tannins and black currant flavors. It is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",79441
"5131","This nervy and vibrant wine takes time to reveal the intriguing flavors within. Quite tart and tannic at first, it is firm in texture to balance the ripe, sweet plum, marascino cherry and orange peel aromas. While chewy and lip-smacking in the beginning, deeper flavors come through on the second and third sips, and a smoky nuance develops on the finish.","Red","Grenache","US",5131
"64801","A bright golden color and generous, intricate aromas make this dry wine tempting even before sipping. Schramsberg says it has the least residual sugar of any wine they've made in 50 years. It offers light citrus, ginger and honey aromas, then a soft mouthfilling mousse and tangy lemon-lime flavors. Concentrated but steely and nicely bone-dry in texture, the wine will be fantastic with caviar.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",64801
"22322","Freshly cut peel of tart but ripe red apple entices on the nose. The palate embraces all this with the subtle, creamy richness of autolysis: Think shortcake and soft sponge. A luminous core of fresh, brisk acidity brightens everything, lifting up flavors of red apple, strawberry and tart red currant on the palate. This harmonious rosé leaves a lasting impression and is appetizing with its lightning streak of freshness.","Red","Pinot Noir","England",22322
"3873","Fresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around. This fruit-forward Crianza is mouth-filling and borders on lush. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry, pepper and spice finish solid as a rock, with length and a confirming sense of quality.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",3873
"53561","Griottes are a type of bitter cherry used in cooking, and this wine shares some of that character. It is firmly structured with acidity and an edge of attractive lightness. Age for 2–3 years.","Red","Gamay","France",53561
"30563","MacPhail continues its string of super 2007 vineyard-designated Pinots with this compact, fine young release. It's a bit tight now in acids and tannins, but shows a warm, sweet heart of cherries, raspberries and cola that should emerge with a few years in the cellar. Just beautiful.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",30563
"63236","Hearty sagebrush, rust and dust meet with dried Montgomery cherry and tart pomegranate aromas on the nose of this bottling from a Healdsburg-based producer. It's luscious on the palate with ripe plum fruit and tons of baking spice, from cinnamon to clove cream, nutmeg and vanilla.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63236
"96359","Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.","White","Chardonnay","US",96359
"64938","Aromas of tobacco, vanilla and dried fruit take on a grassy note after airing in the glass. A cool, wet vintage for the region yields a slightly astringent and acidic palate. Flavors of dried plum, cherry and vanilla carry a tart streak, while the finish is both earthy and a bit sour.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",64938
"25137","Solid Mencía, but a little on the generic, bland side. The body is medium, the tannins mellow, and the flavors are your standard dark berry. The finish is easygoing but doesn't offer much pizzazz or lasting impressions. Fresh, no-nonsense Bierzo for everyday drinking.","Red","Mencía","Spain",25137
"52538","This full-bodied but stealthy and deep wine looks very dark in color. It has moderate ripe fruit and spice aromas, but doesn't really show its cards until the flavors almost explode with boysenberry and blackberry jam, and nuances of wood smoke and dark chocolate hit the palate. It has great intensity, layers of flavor and a nice, lingering finish.","Red","Primitivo","US",52538
"89104","Aromas of mango and candied-orange rind lend a heady tropical feel to this concentrated TBA full of peach and marmalade flavors. Unctuous with sweet nectar, yet exquisitely dainty on the palate, it quivers with tangerine acidity and a finish that's laced with saffron and honey.","White","Riesling","Germany",89104
"52775","Extended time in the bottle, as well as 18 months in French oak, lend gravitas and elegance to this Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of maturity—whiffs of truffle and wet soil—lend delightful complexity to sweet-tart black currant and cherry flavors. The finish is bristling and bright, lingering long on a puckering cranberry tone.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52775
"33591","Thanks to wines like this, expect a bright future for this appellation, which is just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. Aromas of ripe plums, brown spices, turned earth and black slate lead into a silky palate, where red fruits are cut with an emergent, cinnamon-y spice and slightly leathery tannic grip.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33591
"51629","Made from 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with savory aromas of fennel, dark berry, bell pepper and cedar. The firm palate offers black currant, black cherry, clove and Mediterranean herbs. Assertive but fine-grained tannins add elegance.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",51629
"6647","Zesty in black pepper and luscious in blackberry, blueberry and raspberry, the grapes are from 90-plus-year-old hillside vines. Complex and structured, it offers a balanced point of view and plenty of intrigue, simultaneously fresh and brooding.","Red","Zinfandel","US",6647
"27719","Red cherries, pure and ripe, are the heart of this soft wine. It's a bit low in acidity, but a few drops of Petite Sirah, Carignane and Alicante help give it structure. At four years of age, it's ready to drink now.","Red","Grenache","US",27719
"55621","This 16–acre estate is run biodynamically, producing intensely flavored, honeyed, ripe wines. This is succulent from ripe fruit, with the acidity bright and vivid, finishing with sweet pineapple and apricot flavors.","White","Chardonnay","France",55621
"83222","A hint of adhesive bandage on the nose casts a sweaty note over the otherwise pretty tones of violets and cherries. On the palate, the wine is medium bodied, and it's tart and tangy on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",83222
"1342","The sunshine of the Languedoc comes through in this wine's warm, soft fruit. A touch of acidity and a backdrop of tannins give it contrast and a fine, ready-to-drink character.","Red","Merlot","France",1342
"93500","Practically a liquid fruit salad, this smells and tastes like orange, apple, cantaloupe and banana. The texture is smooth and rounded, rather than crisp. A little buttery flavor comes through on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",93500
"39756","The color is quite deep and golden, the aroma is earthy and the flavors are strong, grapy and very ripe. This wine is full bodied and almost sweet.","White","Chardonnay","US",39756
"36227","Made with Piedirosso and Aglianico, this young juicy red opens with aromas of fragrant purple flower, dark berry, clove and a tarry note. The fresh easy-drinking palate doles out mouthfuls of red cherry, raspberry and brown pepper alongside soft tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",36227
"68042","A spicy note of cinnamon or bitter almond opens the nose of this tangy Soave. In the mouth, it delivers layers of stone fruit, honey, pineapple and pear. Pair this vineyard-designate white with roasted eggplant in curry sauce. The high alcohol does stand out.","White","Garganega","Italy",68042
"6871","This is an open, soft, ripe and fruity wine. With a finely integrated tannic structure and plenty of red fruits and acidity, it is a generous full wine that is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",6871
"76480","Ripe and creamy wine, with some herbaceousness and yellow fruits. Layering citrus and a tangy texture, it's fruity, full of lively acidity and ready to drink this year. Screwcap.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",76480
"83414","This 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with jammy aromas of cherry marmalade and blackberry preserves. The fruit tones are very intense but the spice nuances are integrated and folded within the natural density of the mouthfeel.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",83414
"37826","Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of wet leaves, underbrush, leather and prune. The palate offers dried red and black cherry, grilled sage and a confectionary note alongside lithe tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",37826
"20297","This wine is already evolved, with aromas of overripe black fruit, raisin, prune, oak and espresso. The dense palate shows blackberry extract layered with chocolate and oak but it lacks freshness.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",20297
"35587","This softly textured wine explodes with chocolate and strawberry flavors, a bright streak of acidity keeping its ripeness in check. Low in oak impact, it shows cigar and black licorice seasonings as it opens in the glass.","Red","Zinfandel","US",35587
"16018","Very ripe pear plays on the enticing nose. The palate has the same refreshing and appetizing fruitiness. Lemony brightness pervades the light-bodied palate and makes for a very moreish finish.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",16018
"41874","Full-bodied and intense for a rosé wine, the Lekkerwijn offers complexity in a dry, concentrated delivery. Savory and spicy with an herbal spin, the wine finishes long. Pair with spicy food, duck, game fish.","Rosé","Rosé","South Africa",41874
"46250","Better than the ‘04, due to its greater structure, Bella Luna's ‘05 Pinot has complex acids and tannins. They provides the architecture for the extremely ripe cherry, raspberry and cola flavors that have been liberally aged in new oak. Best now in its flashy, seductive youth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46250
"7150","A little bulky and maybe just beginning to fade. This is a rounder and chunkier specimen than the 2008 Cipreses SB, and it shows softness at its core and hints of green bean and bell pepper. Fortunately, holdover acids and green-fruit notes bring it back to higher ground. Drink immediatelyor wait for the release of the '08 vintage.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",7150
"52911","This is a very new-wood dominated wine, that will appeal to lovers of California Cabernet. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are there as well, very modern, very polished. It is a fine wine, but maybe not Bordeaux.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",52911
"85347","Aromas of waxy apple skin and white melon rind lead the nose, though a soft lemon oil accent unfolds in the back after the wine warms. The mouthfeel is round yet lifted, with ripe melon and sweet citrus flavors that are balanced by a good acidic cut to the finish. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",85347
"71013","This is one of the only Rieslings to come out of the valley. The aromas are reserved for the variety, with notes of lime leaf, citrus, Bosc pear and nut oil. The palate drinks dry, and is flavorful, with abundant stone-fruit and citrus notes that linger. It seems a bit heavy handed but still brings enjoyment.","White","Riesling","US",71013
"3823","Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit. A lush mix of tangerine, melon and peach notes combine, expanding across the palate. It's drinking quite well already but should continue improve through 2024.","White","Chardonnay","US",3823
"20947","This tastes almost like a fortified wine, with strong alcohol heat boosting very dry wild-blackberry, pepper and prune flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",20947
"22273","Despite its low alcohol level, this is an attractively plump, medium-bodied wine, marked by a harmonious kaleidoscope of fruit. Passion fruit, nectarine and pink grapefruit all make appearances before vanishing a bit quickly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",22273
"59849","Intense in lemon and silky, it shows a touch of effervescence from the bright acidity and is textured from the time spent in barrel. The finish and lingering aftertaste steer sweet, into the land of butterscotch and caramel.","White","Chardonnay","US",59849
"29981","A welcome new entry in the burgeoning Oregon sparkling wine scene, this vintage-dated, all Pinot Noir cuvée can stand right alongside the best in the U.S. Details in both aroma and flavor bring elements of sweet hay, lemon rind, pineapple and green apple, with fine bead and impressive length.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",29981
"13754","Blue flower, blackberry, leather, underbrush and vanilla aromas jump out the glass with this warm, full-bodied wine. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers ripe black cherry and sweet oak accented with vanilla and cinnamon notes. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",13754
"7380","A brand-new offering from this producer that usually traffics in Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from its own estate, this initial attempt at a white wine is stunning, a well-honed marriage between site and winemaker. Thick and expansive on the palate, it's a complex study in succulent apple and ginger, with a mineral-laden finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",7380
"28332","Exuberantly juicy blackberry and blueberry intermingle in this midweight wine, undeterred by oak. Well-integrated, the tannins make a play on the finish, competing with dusty chocolate and mocha, a dustiness that takes on rocky minerality, recalling this wine's terroir.","Red","Zinfandel","US",28332
"81815","This is a light and fruity LBV. The black fruits are laced with acidity as well as the brandy spirit. It is smooth, round and with just a light sprinkling of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.","Port","Port","Portugal",81815
"13612","Subtle berry and wildflower aromas lead the nose of this bright, friendly red. The informal palate offers crushed wild cherry, raspberry and a hint of clove alongside soft, rather fleeting tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",13612
"48284","Smoky aromas of campfire and clove are blended with high-toned black-fruit scents draped in additional toasty oak. An energetic palate brings its share of resiny, heavy oak, while dark-berry flavors come with woody, toasty, charred accents that suggest clove and black pepper.","Red","Syrah","Spain",48284
"12992","Simple and ripe, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors, accented with sweet oak, and brightened by stimulating acidity. Lots of good flavor, but you wind up wishing it had more interest.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12992
"66126","Dark and sexy aromas of spiced blackberry, boysenberry and blueberry compote come with details of potpourri, cumin seed and leather. A blend of 90% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 5% Pinotage, this sports firm tannins that are enveloped in the wine's finessed midpalate flesh. Long and open on the finish, with some warmth.","Red","Red Blend","US",66126
"17572","This blend of 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec, 20% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc and 12% Merlot is very approachable on the nose with blackberry and black-pepper aromas. The palate also offers the black fruit with a touch of purple flowers, but it is somewhat simple and weak, especially compared to this winery's other bottlings.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",17572
"6543","Pink grapefruit and lemon rind notes are elevated on the nose, with wet stone and candied watermelon lingering in the background. The palate on this 100% Merlot rosé is citrus-driven, yet an impression of roundness comes from tart peach and melon tones.","Rosé","Rosé","US",6543
"90229","Steely and sharp yet delicately sweet, this medium-bodied Riesling keeps a balance between austerity and forward fruitiness. It's vibrantly fresh, with crisp grapefruit and lemon flavors anchored by a core of acidity. Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its freshness.","White","Riesling","Germany",90229
"11286","This is downright herbaceous from front to back. Hard aromas suggest eucalyptus, black olive and sweaty leather. In the mouth, grit and high acidity provide little cushion, while herbal flavors of cherry and blackberry taste salty and baked.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",11286
"56889","Funky aromas of barnyard eventually burn off to reveal game, animal, rubber, earth and leather. The palate displays porcini mushroom with raw cherry, prune, nutmeg and dried sage. There's not much complexity and it's not an ager so enjoy over the next few years.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",56889
"85741","Dry, spicy, earthy red-fruit aromas lead to a fresh palate with good body. Plum and spiced cherry flavors extend only so far, while this tasty little wine finishes dry, spicy and with a dusting of cocoa.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",85741
"45294","The aromas on this wine run jammy, soft and baked. This is medium in intensity, with some dilution and herbal flavors of tobacco, berry and spice. The finish is modest and a bit green.","Red","Merlot","Chile",45294
"101879","A slightly reduced aroma unfurls from the glass, begging for more time to air before unfolding with structured layers of olive, sage and pomegranate. The acid-driven structure is noticeably lean and layered.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101879
"4688","A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",4688
"3804","Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper.","Red","Syrah","US",3804
"12636","Midlevel apple-based aromas are mild, as is a palate that's more basic than exciting. Oily tropical flavors of banana and pear turn slightly bitter on a finish that shows a green-leaning note of bell pepper.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",12636
"26849","Perfumed in rose and violet, with a sauvage scent of musk, this distinctive wine is soft and silky on the palate. It features a mix of red cherry and sage, with a full body and an expansive and lengthy finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26849
"92687","Intensely ripe and concentrated fruit flavors dominate both the aromas and flavors of this very full-bodied but ultrasmooth wine. Light notes of dried sage and cinnamon dust the blackberry jam and candied-strawberry flavors for a nuanced complexity despite the high alcohol and supreme ripeness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",92687
"42990","Bright fruit tones of cherry, pomegranate and red currant give this Brunello a pristine and youthful personality. The quality of those red fruit aromas is remarkable and the wine shows well-integrated spice, leather and tobacco notes. A very welcome splash of sweet-fruit flavor helps smooth out Sangiovese's natural acidity.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",42990
"105145","Subtle smoke notes accent tangerine, lemon and lime in this invigorating dry Riesling. Fermented via ambient yeast, its refinement and restrained elegance sets it apart from Casa Larga's other Rieslings. The finish is lingering yet fresh.","White","Riesling","US",105145
"32702","This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",32702
"96557","Initially smooth and rounded, this wine opens to reveal a structured character. A note of tangy lemon zest cuts through the pear and quince flavors, which creates a balance between richness and tautness. Ready to drink in 1–2 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",96557
"8255","Full, ripe and roundly fruity, this is a good example of the natural opulence of 2009. It has rich black fruits, soft tannins, a dark hint of wood and generous richness. Powered by both its acidity and its structure, it is developing well. Drink from 2014.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",8255

"98114","Aromas of red berry, rose petal, blue flower, crushed herb and a whiff of espresso lift out of the glass along with a menthol note. The taut vibrant palate offers crushed strawberry, tart cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins. It's extremely elegant but still youthfully austere at this stage so give it several more years to unwind. Drink 2023–2038.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98114
"43160","This is a delightful wine, crowd pleasing and complex. It benefits from its lack of oak by focusing on its lifted fruit—a twist of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit—its acidity nicely measured and not one-dimensional. The crisp freshness is complemented by a hint of white rock and subtle lushness on the back palate.","White","Chardonnay","US",43160

"87093","Pure Syrah from 14-year-old vines, this offers classic peppery aromatics, blue fruits, good concentration, and a hint of the Walla Walla funk that marks the better Syrahs of the region. It's lifted with excellent acidity and continues into a focused finish with highlights of coffee grounds.","Red","Syrah","US",87093
"95089","Dusty, chunky peach and apple aromas find a second gear with airing. This feels round, with mild acidity and flavors that range from apple and citrus to sweet banana. The finish is mostly smooth and full flavored, albeit sweet.","White","Verdejo","Spain",95089
"35011","The main issue with this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is a streak of vegetal unripeness that accompanies the cherries and blackberries. The second problem is excessive softness. Drink up.","Red","Red Blend","US",35011

"3564","Grown in the Sebastopol Hills area, this Pinot tastes very young and jammy and immature. Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so. But it could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3564

"81471","Mendocino's Navarro Vineyards hits it out of the ballpark with this truly stellar Sauvignon Blanc, its 20th year making SB. Partially barrel-fermented, this is an inviting wine of subtle jasmine aromas and touching minerality. An incredibly well-balanced version of the varietal full of lemon thyme and passion fruit.

It offers nuanced aromas of spice, tobacco, vanilla and savory notes that are followed by plentiful, palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that extend out through a long, fruit and spice-filled finish.

We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",94133
"74522","The 2005 Inkwell wines are undeniably big, but they manage to carry their weight and ample alcohol levels with a surprising measure of balance and grace.

Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103303
"51806","There's a tropical touch to this wine's mellow and light nose, but that opulent fruit is cut by lemon, red apple and mandarin zest. Fresh pluot and tropical candy notes show on the zippy palate.","White","Pinot Gris","US",51806
"56483","Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc meet up with smaller amounts of Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot in this soft, silky blend.

"1388","As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1388
"29320","Oak dominates this wine, with vanilla, chocolate, buttered toast and caramel aromas and flavors. Under all that you'll find some good, ripe black cherry fruit. With soft tannins, it's ready to drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",29320
"44302","Popcorn and butter are the lead aromas, and they give way to dusty baked apple over time. This wine feels round, but with just enough acidity. Flavors of candy corn, vanilla, spun sugar and ripe stone fruits finish sweet and fleshy.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",44302
"25277","Fresh, simple, apple-flavored wine, with an edge of citrus and soft vanilla flavors. The wine is attractive and clean with elegance coupled to ripe fruit.","White","Chardonnay","France",25277
"26944","Ripeness is evident in the wine's earthy nose, which blends prune, tire rubber and spice with good results. Serious and medium-bodied for Cabernet Sauvignon, with a cascade of red-berry flavors followed closely by a wave of dry oak and mocha. Shows some drying tannins and a peppery aftertaste. Drink now–2009.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",26944
"75041","The Peach Tree cuvée actually carries a whiff of peaches—possibly the power of suggestion. Its strawberry fruit includes an herbal component, more like a wine from the Eola Hills than Dundee. Overall structure is fine, and aging in 42% new oak puts some toasted coconut into the finish. This has the balance and persistence to age nicely through 2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75041
"33343","This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",33343
"5279","A complex wine, exhibiting smoky tannins, rich fruit, a dark texture and concentration. Produced by the Moueix winemaking team, it feels complete with its sense of style and elegance as well as weight. Give this powerful wine many years in the cellar.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",5279
"12409","Perfumed blossom and apricot aromas are especially appealing here. Dry in style, with a plush pink grapefruit palate, the wine's sharp acidic edges lend verve. The finish is long, marked by a cool, mineral tang. Delicious already, it should hold well through 2025.","White","Riesling","Germany",12409
"17144","The Antinori family's Brunello estate has seen ups and downs in terms of wine consistency over the past five years. But 2008 delivers an honest and nicely concentrated expression that seems to benefit beautifully from the slightly warmer temperatures in its lower altitude vineyards. Dark chocolate, cherry fruit and barbecue spice appear on the finish.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",17144
"104216","This charming and refreshing wine has aromas like green apples. Richer flavors that suggest white peach accompany a tangy but smooth texture. Light to medium bodied, it is perfect for lunch or pre-dinner drinking.","White","White Blend","US",104216
"21160","Soft, warm and lightly tannic, this has an herbaceous character. Its fresh acidity balances its black currant flavor. It is fragrant, fruity and mature; ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",21160
"10282","A Bordeaux-style blend, tart and fruity, with an unusual fruit flavor mix that starts with citrus and orange and runs into bright berries. Two things keep the score down—a chalky edge to the tannins, and some noticeable volatility (a whiff of nail polish)on the nose.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",10282
"83718","A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with delicate aromas suggesting black-skinned fruit and a whiff of cooking spice. The easygoing palate delivers black currant and leather alongside round tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",83718

"32105","Lighter in color, high-toned aromas of raspberry and cranberry jam lead to full-bodied jammy, lip-smacking red-fruit flavors with the barrel influence dialed back. It's a spot on example of the variety.","Red","Zinfandel","US",32105
"90087","From the outset this is woody and artificial in style. Aromas of milk chocolate and clove are strange and forced. In the mouth, this feels wiry but also gummy, with clove-heavy oak and tannic bite. In general, this is overly woody, candied and seemingly not natural.","Red","Merlot","Chile",90087
"38814","Full and ripe, this is a lemon and crisp apple flavored wine. There is a hint of toast from the six months in barrel that also adds a little pepper. Fine acidity and a tangy texture suggests it could age. Drink this wine from 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",38814
"15360","Aromas include ripe black fruit, spice, savory herb and a balsamic note. The tight palate offers black raspberry, crushed blackberry, menthol and sage alongside a firmly tannic backbone. A licorice note signals the finish. It's still young and a little astringent on the close. Drink after 2016.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",15360
"22162","Aromas of berry, toast and espresso lead the nose while the tight palate offers dried cherry and a hint of ground pepper. Firm, grippy tannins give it a mouth-drying finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",22162
"91849","Beaver Creek's Lake County Zin is juicy and spicy, full of stewy red fruit and rough-hewn tannins that are thick and fragrant of oak and molasses. Definitely big though well made for its style. Time and air are its friends.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91849
"83710","This Hawke's Bay-based producer has drawn fruit from Central Otago for this wine, which shows some austere tannins and minty overtones. Cherry and cinnamon notes join wintergreen, while the finish is clean, dry and firm. Worth holding a few years to see what develops.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",83710
"77417","Tropical in style, which for Los Vascos is as expected. Year after year, this Casablanca Chardonnay tastes, smells and seems more like Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay. As per usual, it's spunky, citric, green and grapefruity. A breed unto itself, with a zesty, green character.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",77417
"32863","Produced from the estate's oldest vines close to the Douro river, this is a structured wine with tannins and rich spiciness. It will develop gently, giving a wine that is structured without being too tannic. Drink from 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",32863
"20517","Harvested from six different vineyard sites, this wine employed 10% stems and 10% new oak for a brooding sense of blue and red berry, the acidity plenty zesty and tannins softly measured.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20517
"21163","Rustic and full bodied, this Oregon Primitivo is plenty ripe, yet it retains nuances of olive and herb, along with thick red fruit. A whisper of smoke weaves through the finish.","Red","Primitivo","US",21163
"68409","Marco Felluga's creamy Chardonnay is exactly the kind of wine you'll want to pair with butter chicken and mashed potatoes or lobster. There's great consistency and density here and the wine is redolent of yellow rose, apricot, exotic fruit and light almond shadings.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",68409
"49425","Black fruit, chocolate, licorice and menthol aromas take center stage in this brawny, forward Brunello. The palate starts off with fleshy black cherry accented with notes of cinnamon-spice layered with bitter dark chocolate, but it finishes on a note of drying tannins. You'll also notice the hefty alcohol on the close.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",49425
"57701","Deep ruby to the eye, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot has a bouquet of coffee and black currant preserves. It offers a frankly gorgeous interplay between fruit and cool herbal flavors, with black cherry joined on the palate by licorice, eucalyptus, butterscotch and flint. The drawn-out finish offers a surprisingly bright burst that inspires taking the next sip.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Israel",57701
"41385","Its presentation and dark bottle suggest a premium cuvée, borne out by the ripe character of this toasty wine. Produced from old vines in good years, this is a wine that could well be aged. Creamy apple purée flavors and rounded fruits add to the richness.","White","Melon","France",41385
"100035","The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100035
"58134","Black-plum fruit is woven through smoke, slight juniper and eucalyptus on the nose of this bottling by Steve McIntyre, one of Monterey County's most respected growers. Black raspberry and tangy cherry flavors are warmed by vanilla and clove on the palate, complete with a tannic tension.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58134
"67999","You'll find some good cherry, vanilla, cola and sandalwood flavors in this dry Pinot Noir. It's on the light side, but is modest in alcohol, with an elegant mouthfeel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67999
"85417","As this enters its second year in bottle, the nose is still clean and punchy, much like fruit salad. A plump solid mouthfeel holds flavors of salty peach. Beyond that, there's not a lot to say about this standard Albariño. Drink immediately.","White","Albariño","Spain",85417
"48308","This offers everything you want in a Napa Cabernet, and at a decent price. It's dry, balanced in acidity and tannins, and elegantly constructed, with classic blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors touched by oak. Not an ager, and doesn't pretend to be; just a nice wine to drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",48308
"2232","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",2232
"72400","An earthy wine from the Laguna Ridge neighborhood within the Russian River Valley, this features a light yet richly textured mingling of cinnamon, clove, wild strawberry and aromatic violet. Offering depth and length, this is a delicious representation of both the region and the vintage.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72400
"74414","The nose delivers a mix of herbal berry, cola and earth, while the palate is fresh and deep, with lightly medicinal cherry, cola, blackberry tobacco, mocha and more. Finishes rich and chocolaty, with a rush of textbook Chilean flavors including tobacco, herbs, olive and black fruits.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",74414
"27809","Straightforward, perhaps even simple, but once again well-made inexpensive juice. At 80% Merlot, it is soft with berry and hint of tobacco predominating. The light fruit has pleasant cocoa shadings, and it has a poised finish with mild tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",27809
"73015","Quiet intensity and broad complexity characterize this medium-bodied, entirely bracing wine that smells like cranberry, red cherry and rhubarb. Flavors suggest crisp cranberries and cinnamon with wisps of smoke and clove, almost vibrating with vivid acidity and firm tannins. It will improve through at least 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73015
"40883","Heftier than the producer's Platt Vineyard Pinot, this estate-grown wine features astoundingly bright acidity around dense black cherry fruit. It saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year, a recipe that works to buoy the wine and give it plenty of complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40883
"97554","Aromatically dazzling, this wine shows complex notes of smoked meat, fire pit, black olive, peat, crushed flowers and sea breeze. The savory flavors are rich yet light and restrained, with a long, drawn-out finish. It's an impressive wine whose best years are far in front of it. Drink 2020 to 2026.","Red","Syrah","US",97554
"73356","This wine is no shrinking violet on the nose, resplendent in fresh roses and strawberry-raspberry. It confounds in its ability to provide huge flavor and personality while retaining a freshness and high level of acidity on the palate. A leathery, savory component speaks quietly amid the suggestions of cinnamon and cigar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73356

"21377","Aromas of ripe blackberry, anisette, black pepper and scorched earth lead the nose. On the tight palate, notes of licorice, espresso, leather and clove accent a core of dried black cherry and fig.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",21377
"49351","Subdued aromas of French oak, underbrush, espresso and menthol lead the way. The rather lean but polished palate offers tart sour cherry, vanilla and roasted coffee bean alongside vibrant acidity and firm tannins that grip the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",49351
"25654","Although the wine is closed at the moment, showing only its tannic side, it has a good promise from the weight of fruit that's at the back. Ripe and juicy, it should age well. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",25654
"105140","Hailing from the winery's Los Alamos Valley Vineyard that lines Highway 101, this wine is quite light in color and shows delicate, clean honeydew, honey dust and apple-blossom candy aromas. It's light yet playful in the glass, with limestone, lime rind and green apple flavors. It's straightforward but well assembled.","White","Chardonnay","US",105140
"57409","This tastes like a cool-climate Zin because of the deep plum and black cherry flavors and light earthy, herbal accents, with touches of cedar and toast in the bouquet. It has moderate tannins and medium-to-full body.","Red","Zinfandel","US",57409

"87602","Made from 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 10% Carignan, this Roussillon rosé opens with elegant notes of green pepper and savory herbs that frame the tight red cherry and underripe melon fruits. Medium in weight and a touch plush in feel, red cherry and berry tones dominate the palate, but finish bright and with a slightly bitter, fruit skin-like edge on the close.","Rosé","Rosé","France",87602
"25173","This wine offers simple richness around a full-bodied frame, dotted in well-defined flavors of golden apple and white flower. Honey and toasted oak provide added concentration and texture in this tiny production wine from a small producer.","White","Chardonnay","US",25173

"66304","This Chardonnay is a little heavy-handed on the butterscotch or caramel, top to bottom, but its citrus and mineral accents keep the toastiness in check. Offers yellow fruit on the palate and on the nose.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",66304
"8052","Forest floor, new leather, pressed violet, ripe berry, Mediterranean herb and eucalyptus aromas lead the way on this robust red. The densely concentrated palate shows raisin, vanilla, prune and espresso alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. Chewy tannins provide support while a hint of licorice wraps up the finish. Give it a few years to unwind, then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",8052
"30535","Generic red-fruit aromas are accented by sage and thyme, while in the mouth the feel is wiry. Full-blooded raspberry and cherry flavors come with pronounced acidity and lighter-framed tannins, so there's some sharpness. All in all it's a no-frills red wine with minimal Cabernet character.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",30535
"24076","Get passed the name and label and this is a typical fresh and fruity wine from Gascogne. It is light, herbaceous and immediately drinkable with its lemon and green fruits. Screwcap.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",24076

"89451","Snoqualmie can legitimately lay claim to being Washington's most consistent and reliable producer of mass market, value-priced wines. This tart and racy Syrah is a fine example of the quality—no frills, but no fudging either. It tastes like fruit—blueberries and boysenberries, with some leafy, herbal tannins.

A fine Pinot Noir that should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57665
"6269","This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6269

"67892","The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe.

And while this is a bit soft and jammy on the tongue, there's enough structure to support baked, rich, black-fruit flavors and dark spice notes. A finish full of mossy notes, prune and mellow tannins says drink this wine now through 2015.","Red","Mencía","Spain",103391
"88838","Big, black and juicy, it manages to be both dense and structured and freshly fruity at the same time. With this combination promising great things, the wine is ripe and fragrant.

"71127","In contrast to the winery's big, rough and tumble style of Merlot, this Cabernet is lightly fruity. It shows cherry and cranberry hard candy fruit flavors. The tannins are rough and substantial, and quickly take over the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71127
"100334","This vineyard-designate Barbaresco opens with streamlined elegance and subtle aromas of chopped mint, crème de cassis and ginger. The firmness of the tannins holds it together.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",100334
"87716","This soft and fruity wine has open white fruit and citrus flavors. It is light and crisp with just the right amount of acidity. Coming from a warm year, it is richer than in other vintages, smoother and riper. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",87716
"57818","Charred, smoky aromas of blackberry are ripe as can be, with a note of graphite. The palate is huge, polished, pure and ideal if you like ripe, modern Rioja. Flavors of toast, blackberry, spice and mocha finish toasty, with strong notes of pepper and coffee. Drink this smooth, silky single-vineyard Rioja through 2021.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",57818
"37415","There is something ethereal and beyond words about this wine, a full-bodied but never intrusive expression of spicy cinnamon, black pepper and wild pine that makes it a puzzle worth trying to solve. Fruit plays a part, though softly, eking out shadows of raspberry and just-picked strawberry atop smooth, silky tannins and a measured, seductive body. The finish recalls a clove cigarette enjoyed in the rain.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37415
"101877","Moderately ripe berry and cassis aromas show an increasing level of wood grain as this breathes. A jammy palate is plump and medium deep, while flavors of earthy berry fruits and stewed plum taste smooth at the start but herbal and mossy on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",101877
"31478","This wine clearly needs to breathe. It is only after a few minutes of airtime that it shows its true colors: then very tart and aromatic apples appear, alongside a hint of smoke and a sheer touch of lemon freshness. The palate continues on that lemony streak and is absolutely dry. The body is lithe and slender and shows great freshness and intensity. Apple and stone flavors linger. Drink 2020–2030.","White","Riesling","France",31478
"42268","Vibrant, coppery salmon in color, this lively and delightful rosé is two-thirds Grenache and one-third Mourvèdre, all stainless steel-fermented. Pretty watermelon and strawberry flavors are accented by streaks of cracker and mineral.","Rosé","Rosé","US",42268
"52851","By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate, and the finish is clean, if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",52851
"62907","This is a very approachable wine, with lush aromas of red fruit and tobacco, followed by soft, silky tannins. It shows enough intensity and staying power to pair with spicy barbecue ribs.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",62907
"43313","Cedar, graphite and concentrated plum aromas mark the nose of this full-bodied wine from the southern end of the appellation, where it's cool and breezy from the Pacific Ocean. Entirely varietal, it shows a wealth of red and black berry fruitiness, dotted with dried herb.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43313
"12492","While the aromas of white strawberry, passion fruit preserves and citrus are soft spoken, they increase in intensity on the palate. Relatively low in alcohol, with sweetness and bright acidity, this should pair well with exotic, slightly spicy fare, like curried chicken with mango chutney.","White","Riesling","US",12492
"72137","Delicately perfumed, this is an attractive, fruity wine.It layers acidity and a light tannic edge with white fruits and red currants. There is a soft vanilla aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",72137
"57423","Aromas of vanilla and coconut share space on the nose with ripe notes of blackberry and prune. This feels just fresh enough, with ample body. Ripe berry, raisin and chocolate flavors end a touch flat.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",57423
"19154","This Moscato is a great value, a perfect opening for a big party. Made in a subtle, lightly sweet style, with sophisticated gardenia and white flower scents on the nose. A jazzy midpalate mineral note contributes some edge, while the elegant finish trails off into intriguing notes of fresh ginger and roasted pineapple. Drink up, no reason to age.","White","Moscato","Italy",19154
"68827","A richer, yet no better, style than the 2000 Limestone Coast bottling. Peach and vanilla aromas and flavors take the lead, with buttered popcorn and alcoholic warmth playing supporting roles. The finish is long, featuring a slightly bitter note akin to citrus rind.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",68827
"1189","Named after the 15th century owner of this estate, the wine comes from a selection of the best parcels. With impressive tannins, a dense structure and rich bold black fruits, this is a powerful wine. It is full of ripe fruit with a mineral texture and has a good future. Drink from 2021.","Red","Malbec","France",1189
"10885","Ripe and fruity, this is a wine made for drinking soon. It has ripe black-plum fruit, structured tannins and a juicy and smoky character that is already delicious.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",10885
"11815","One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this suffers from a sameness of flavors. Black fruits are soaked in aggressive and bitter oak flavors that push the smoke and char to the forefront, leaving bitter tannins as a result.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",11815
"47919","Produced from a small vineyard in Pouilly Fuissé, this rich wine is full of ripe, generous fruit. Spice and yellow-fruit flavors blend seamlessly with the soft texture and perfumed acidity. It is developing into a very fine wine, ready to drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",47919
"32087","The aromas are bright, with notes of fresh herb, red cherry, Red Vines, orange peel and barrel spice. The palate shows a pleasing sense of concentration and richness, with light meaty notes on the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",32087
"56344","This highly concentrated, richly ripe red explores notions of plum, black cherry and tobacco. It finishes with a mildness of dried herb.","Red","Merlot","US",56344
"87164","This simple wine opens with subdued aromas of blue flowers, red berry and a whiff of menthol. The informal palate offers raw, red cherry alongside hints of mint and anise. Brisk acidity and rather fleeting tannins lead to a short, drying finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",87164
"73827","This blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão has produced an impressive wine that is packed with rich tannins and a dark brooding structure. Intense acidity cuts through the rich, powerful texture to give a fresh aftertaste. It is still young, so drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",73827
"101952","This is the oldest of the Milbrandt vineyards, planted in 1997. Though a bit riper than the Evergreen vineyard bottling, this Chardonnay feels lighter, with less density. It's balanced and complete, and the flavors of green apple and Asian pear offer a fine rendition of well-ripened Washington fruit.","White","Chardonnay","US",101952
"99996","An awesome wine—this is so massively intense in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, it's hard to believe. From the first sip though the middle palate, it's seemingly sweet with a fruity essence, but the finish is dry and firm. Drink now and for 8–10 years, at the very least.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99996
"63457","Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",63457
"52440","It's rare to see a varietal bottling of Franc from this appellation. This one offers aromas of fresh and dried herbs along with cherry, still seeming a bit locked-up. The cherry and raspberry flavors are on the lighter side of medium bodied, trailing toward the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",52440
"52325","This lightly oaked wine is full of fruit, ripe with red berries and crisp with acidity, just hinting at Douro minerality. That makes for a balanced fruity wine that with its soft tannins is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",52325
"81457","Lots of ripe blackberry and cherry jam flavors in this soft Merlot. It's really too sweet for comfort, but plenty of consumers will like it. Production was 65,000 cases.","Red","Merlot","US",81457
"78359","Pôpa was the family's nickname for grandpa. The winery, run by grandson Stéphane Ferreira, is the grandkids' tribute. This richly perfumed wine, by consultant Luis Pato, comes from a field blend of 21 grape varieties. Old vines with an average age of 82-years-old in a single parcel have given the wine huge concentration and rich swathes of tannins and black plum and damson fruit. The wine has power while also retaining plenty of elegance. It is an impressive wine, just approaching its peak and ready from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",78359
"44452","Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",44452
"91573","Aromas of vanilla, mocha, dried herbs, pencil lead and flowers rise up from the glass. Rich and hedonistic in style, it's full of concentrated cherry and coffee flavors that pack a hefty punch.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",91573
"49982","Clumsy, with outsized acidity and sweet, jammy raspberry, orange and cherry flavors. Tastes sweet and sour, like a Chinese pork sauce. Contains too many different varieties to list, but they include Muscat.","Red","Red Blend","US",49982
"68088","The vast region of La Mancha is on the prowl in the 21st century, and wines like this won't hurt the region's improving reputation. The nose here is fresh and loaded with berry sweetness and accents of cinnamon and forest floor. The palate is round and chewy, with plum and berry flavors. It's richer than many so-called alta expresión wines, and the structure goes way beyond that of most under-$10 reds. With some airing and good food, it's a certain winner.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",68088
"79860","This estate-grown Riesling brings fresh apples and white peaches to the table. Fresh and concentrated, it hits a generous 13.6% alcohol, with suggestions of sweetness from the quite ripe fruit, although it is technically dry. It seems to have real potential for aging and developing over a decade or more.","White","Riesling","US",79860
"62509","Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Spain",62509
"15471","A solid, fruity wine supported by ripe tannins. The wine has a good sense of its rich self, a fine presence of ripe plum fruit flavors and a warm texture. There is a fine juicy aftertaste.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",15471
"17717","Tastes young and acidic but weirdly ripe now, with jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors and a tart finish. The question is whether it will age. Unlikely, but you never know.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",17717
"18836","A massive and concentrated wine that is held together by its dark, very dry tannic structure. It shows weight and superripe blackberry flavors that are cut with acidity. Complex and rich, it is likely to remain structured as it ages. Drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",18836
"69489","Offering aromas of sweet peach, this is a round, full Sauvignon Blanc with a pleasant texture. Light in alcohol but rich on the finish, it just begs for shellfish or melted goat cheese salad.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",69489
"20975","From Montalcino's most historic estate, this pretty Rosso opens with a bright, ruby color and aromas of spice and forest fruit. It delivers bright acidity and silky tannins in the mouth.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",20975
"81559","Young and fruity smelling up front, with a dusting of hard, dry spice. The palate is firm and juicy, with lightly medicinal red fruit flavors. Finishes with dryness, lots of spice and pepper.","Red","Merlot","Argentina",81559
"81627","With a caramel character and light, bright acidity, this is a soft, not-quite-dry wine. It has a warm, open and accessible feel to it, light and fruity on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",81627
"45970","Almost mauve in color, this widely distributed wine (named after the time the winemaking crew pops open their bottles at home) shows candied strawberry, watermelon Jolly Rancher and a touch of slate on the nose. Tons of tongue-tingling acidity and a expertly grippy texture cut through the watermelon and raspberry flavors.","Rosé","Rosé","US",45970
"52696","Fresh apple and white floral aromas are dusted with caramelized sugar and smoke on this dry, mineral-tinged wine. Edgy and lean on the palate but supple in grapefruit flavor, it's a honed, steely white with polish and elegance.","White","Riesling","Germany",52696
"23283","While elegant and a bit restrained, this dry, mineral-laden Sauvignon Blanc boasts crisp white grapefruit and lemon flavors. It's refreshing and brisk, finishing on a delicate green, herbaceous tone.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",23283
"89208","This is a terrific Zinfandel, offering berry, cherry, mocha, spice and cedar flavors that come wrapped in briary tannins. It's technically dry, but with a satisfying honeyed note.","Red","Zinfandel","US",89208
"2831","In this blend of Shiraz and Trincadeira, both grapes contribute red fruits, soft tannins and fresh-faced acidity. With no complications—just bright, juicy fruit—the wine is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",2831
"7417","Classic Weinert wine; meaning it's well-aged, mature and sort of throwback. It's not purple and saturated and sticky; instead it's medium-weight and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry aromas followed by dry cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. A touch of burnt brown sugar offers balance and sweetness, and as a whole it seems ready to drink.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",7417
"58228","Exotic spice, plum, French oak and underbrush aromas lead the nose while the juicy palate offers espresso, raspberry jam and a hint of star anise. It's chewy, with close-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58228
"63159","The medieval chateau of Juliénas is surrounded by vines. This oak-aged wine is rich, smooth and spicy. It is structured with some firm tannins and fine acidity. At the same time, the rich fruit gives the wine a generous, full character. Drink from late 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",63159
"70023","This is a polished, really likeable Chard. It offers everything the variety should: a rich, creamy texture, brisk acidity, and ripe, delicious flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and kiwis coated with vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",70023
"78398","Persistent bubbles deliver lively aromas of kumquat, yeast, sharp lemon and wet slate on the tight, never opulent nose of this bottling. The palate's creamy bubbles are very pleasant in texture, delivering sharp, acid-driven flavors of citrus and a touch of brioche.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",78398
"14255","This tastes straightforward and modestly fruity. Smooth in texture and not very tannic, it has just enough red cherry and plum flavor to be substantive. Made from 70% Zinfandel, 25% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","US",14255
"7553","Wildly complex aromas show on this blend of 72% Grenache, 16% Mourvèdre, 10% Tempranillo and 2% Alicante Bouschet. Ripe raspberry and eucalyptus run into notes of soy sauce and dried lilac. Flavors lean toward purple fruit and ripe raspberry, with bergamot and pencil lead working their way in as well.","Red","Red Blend","US",7553
"62200","The ripest of Diamond Creek's new '09 Cabernets, Red Rock shows a sun-blasted quality of red currants, blueberry and cassis. Heady and exotic, this is rich in tannins and noble in acidity. While it's a joy to drink now and over the next eight years, its extreme ripeness may limit its longterm ageability.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62200
"5233","This wine opens with a lovely fragrance of violet, iris, wild berry, licorice and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate doles out ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, clove, white pepper, tobacco and anise. It's impeccably balanced, with glossy tannins and fresh acidity. Already drinking beautifully, it will also age well for several years.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",5233
"66074","Rubus is a label for wines selected by the fine American importer Fran Kysela, MS. The 2013 is a full-bodied, velvety-textured Barossa Shiraz, offering a rich, luxurious mouthfeel. Cedar and mocha notes are apparent, but there's ample underlying plummy fruit and a long, plush finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",66074
"21493","A bright pinkish-orange color makes this light-bodied wine stand out from the beginning, Fresh watermelon and cherry flavors carry on the rounded palate, with a slight sweetness giving softness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",21493

"19150","Black cherry, mocha and pepper lead on this easy-drinking red from Chaddsford. On the palate, soft cherry fruit, cedar spice and chocolate give the wine a luscious edge. Pair with Mexican mole, spiced ribs or pasta.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",19150
"19601","There is a lightly toasty character in this wine that gives it a round, full texture. Spice goes along with the green and white-fruit flavors to make an intensely fruity wine that hints at a New World style. Drink now. This is one of 15 Bordeaux chateaus by Crus and Domaines de France.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",19601
"84682","Cool-climate pyrazinic aromas are punchy and feline. This feels good but weaker and more dilute than in most years. Briny, pickled citrus flavors follow the nose, while this ends lean and green but solid enough.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",84682
"82658","Dominated by Viosinho, a grape found more often in the Douro, this wine has a fascinating perfumed character. It's smoky, with white currant and green herbs, and a steely edge that adds to the tight structure of the wine.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",82658
"62613","This gets going with clean, light cherry and berry aromas that bring a citrus note to the fore. It feels crisp, dry and pure, with citrus, plum and dust flavors. An elegant rosé made from the Trepat grape, it finishes dry and spicy, with ample leftover fruit.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",62613
"7269","This is a big, flamboyant example of white Hermitage. The aromas are exotic and floral, tinged by oak to resemble grilled pear and citrus, while the flavors suggest grilled corn, peach and toast. Drink it now for its exuberance, or keep through 2030. Three cases imported.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",7269
"14767","Classic Monterey Pinot, dry, crisp, silky and ripe. The fine 2007 vintage has made it explosive in cherries, currants, sassafras and cola, with refined, new oak notes of smoke and spice. Drink this rich wine now through 2013.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14767
"86626","From one of the larger estates in the Edna Valley, this wine has sweet-smelling plum, cherry candy and grenadine aromas. The palate is front-loaded with sagebrush, thyme, dried lavender and rosemary notes, while a hibiscus flavor unfolds in the background.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86626
"78599","Aromas of cherry, spiced meat and plum start off this masculine red. Flavors of smoke, spice and red fruit are balanced and easy to embrace, and the wine offers ageable structure to boot. This is an impressive selection that will pair well with hearty dishes, but it will also be enjoyable on its own.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",78599
"1952","Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf.","Red","Malbec","US",1952
"21140","A rose garden's worth of aromas lift out of the glass in this hearty, full-bodied red, the peppery tannins somewhat grippy on the palate before settling down. Blackberry punches through on the palate, given additional color and lift from the 5% Petit Verdot.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",21140
"32776","One of the new generation of Grüners, reflecting the terroir of the Weinviertel of Lower Austria. It is fresh, crisp, clean—maybe a little too clean—but certainly showing green apple and pepper flavors touched with white fruits. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",32776
"3730","This is a beautiful display of Durell's greatness, crafted from two blocks of the vineyard, one planted to Old Wente, the other in one of the site's most rocky and windy areas. Combined, it offers well-integrated notions of golden apple, pear and honey amidst a freshness of acidity and unobtrusive oak, just the slightest suggestion of nutmeg-dusted brioche on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",3730
"12266","This is round, while also having a mineral edge. Apple and wood flavors power through the crispness, along with a charming touch of honey. For short-term aging.","White","Chardonnay","France",12266
"89544","This full-bodied and robustly concentrated wine has chocolate and cherry aromas, rich and ripe plum and blackberry flavors and layers of chocolate and vanilla on the palate and finish. It feels broad and juicy in texture, too.","Red","Zinfandel","US",89544
"32182","Hugely rich, this was fermented in egg-shaped cuves that have given an impressively rounded character to a wine still so young. The tannins are opulent, letting the black fruits speak powerfully. It still is a wine to age, so drink after 2019.","Red","Malbec","France",32182
"58770","The name references a type of soil. The flavors combine red berries and a whiff of mushroom, along with spice, orange peel and citrus. The wine seems to tighten up through the midpalate, which leaves the finish feeling a bit restrained. Try giving it a good long decanting, or cellar till 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58770
"24945","Cherry red in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of cherry cola and vanilla. It is medium-bodied on the palate, with flavors of black cherry, pomegranate and a final burst of cranberry.","Red","Pinot Noir","Romania",24945

"75117","Stewed berries mix with sweet spice aromas of anise and vanilla on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Tannat. The light-bodied palate is streamlined and focused on watery strawberry and red cherry flavors riding over underripe green notes.","Red","Red Blend","US",75117
"42811","The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",42811
"87418","Crème caramel and spice aromas are exotically appealing on this bright, full-bodied Chardonnay. Dry in style with zesty acidity and fresh apple flavor, the palate is a bit more subtle than the nose, but makes this a straightforward drinker.","White","Chardonnay","US",87418
"71139","A lively Cabernet Sauvignon with dark extraction and intense aromas of blackberry, plum, dark chocolate, cola and tar. The wine is dense and thick, but not heavy at all. In fact, it boasts bright acidity and refreshing fruit flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",71139

"102879","Winemaker Kirk Venge coaxes orange blossom perfume from this otherwise velvety, concentrated and youthful white, toasty in caramelized oak. The concentration makes way for a taste of baked apple and pear within a cradle of nuanced acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",102879
"45383","At the equivalent of $5 for a regular bottle of Cabernet, this three-liter box of wine is a real value. It's rich and fruity in blackberry and spice flavors, with robust tannins and a clean, smooth finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45383
"50071","An earthy if slightly reserved nose offers mushroom and iron aromas on this bottling by the single-vineyard experts in Los Gatos. The wine comes alive on the sip, with bergamot, black tea, bay leaves, Greek spice and thyme decorating the woody elderberry fruits.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50071
"102855","Deep color and complex aromas like dark chocolate and cedar lead to ripe, concentrated and tastefully dry berry and cherry flavors in this Rhône-style blend. The mouthfeel is firm with tannins but polished.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",102855
"14614","Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs. The Cabernet Franc portion shines clearly through as a distinctive weediness, but it's somewhat balanced by roasted black cherries and only a hint of espresso-like oak.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",14614
"52949","Prickly aromas of vinegar, pickled rhubarb and bramble don't exactly roll out the red carpet. The palate has a decent feel, but it's thick and borderline cloying. Tastes both green and sweet, with creamy vanilla and carob flavors. Burnt tasting on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",52949
"2152","La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity.","Rosé","Rosé","US",2152
"99767","This is half Merlot, one third Syrah, with a bit of Cabernet and Petit Verdot as well. It's a very light, fruity wine, with no particular focus. Fine for near-term quaffing.","Red","Red Blend","US",99767
"15833","La Forge is consistently one of Bertrand's top wines, and the 2011 is simply stunning. The dense, heady perfume offers notes of raspberry, black plum, cherry, sweet spice and cocoa powder, which all carry through to the lush, full-weighted palate. The texture is like crushed velvet, with fine yet gripping tannins and ample acidity to keep the mouthfeel fresh. It's a complex and layered wine, with hints of licorice, tobacco leaf and black pepper that grace the finish. Drink 2016–2022.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",15833

"76767","From a small family-run operation that is 100% estate, this Cab is thick in blueberry and blackberry, almost syrupy rich.

"28034","The nose is a blend of peach and earth. The palate comes with great intensity, holding against the sweetness with an exquisitely delicious streak of quinine bitterness which lends direction and precision, along with tangy lemon freshness. This creates ample tension and moreishness as well as a lip-smacking medium-sweet finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",28034
"85205","Juicy strawberry and red plum aromas meet cinnamon, sassafras and earthy scents in this bottling from winemaker Colin Murphy. Beautiful layers of sour cherry combine with dried fennel, wild mint, thyme and rose petal flavors on the palate, which finishes clean and crisp.","Red","Grenache","US",85205
"82388","Ross Mickel (Ross Andrew Winery) made this Côtes du Rhône-style blend, a flashy riot of floral scents and earthy, funky fruit. Even with several hours breathing time it feels tight—decanting is mandatory. But give it a few years in the cellar and it will unpack even more layers of flavor. Dry and astringent in the mouth, it brings young flavors of cranberry juice and grape concentrate, plenty of acidity and minerality, and excellent depth.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",82388
"29883","Note the vintage—2009. This is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. It's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. Don't delay—enjoy it over the next couple of years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",29883
"34600","Here's a lively, informal white redolent of green apple, peach and citrus, with vibrant acidity. It's simple but well made, with a crisp, refreshing finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",34600
"73210","This offering, which is bolstered by 6% Petite Sirah, offers a cohesive nose of allspice, root beer, vanilla, slate minerality and a dark berry core. The root beer and cola spices are strong on the sip, where fatter plum and mulberry flavors are balanced by decent acidity and lightweight tannins.","Red","Grenache","US",73210
"47287","Light in color and stemmy and spicy in equal parts, this light, bright wine is complex and intriguing in its offering of white pepper, baker's yeast and cranberry coated in vanilla. It delivers flavor and nuance in a pleasing showcase of the variety.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47287
"79995","Feels muscular and dry in the mouth, with powerful black cherry, currant, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are potent, but negotiable, although you should give this Syrah a decant of several hours to let it breathe.","Red","Syrah","US",79995
"19713","Reserved aromas of cherry, cranberry, pencil lead and barrel spice lead to sweet fruit flavors back by lightly grainy tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",19713
"50294","This opens with aromas of wild herbs and field greens. This wine is full but flat in feel, with green, minty flavors that overshadow the minimal fruit. The finish is herbal and broad.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",50294
"25853","A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 10% Caniaolo and Merlot, it offers big, ripe black cherry flavors accented with notes of black pepper and cinnamon-spice. The juicy fruit flavors are supported by a solid tannic backbone. It has a forward nature so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",25853
"85536","A fairly priced varietal wine, this shows currant, cranberry, raisin and a flurry of allspice on the nose. It takes on rose petal and lavender aromas as it opens, making it all the more pleasant and memorable.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85536
"25917","The estate vineyard, planted between 1999 and 2005, includes several different blocks, named for family members. This Pinot has a pleasing softness, entering the mouth gently with light raspberry candy flavors. The fruit is wrapped in chocolaty oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25917
"44098","Saline and grapy aromas comprise the nose on this basic red. Hard tannins create pinch and a rubbery feel, while the flavor profile includes solid but minimally expressive black currant and dark plum. This is perfectly drinkable but hollow.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",44098
"44845","This is a dark, fully formed and impressive wine, one that's 70% Tempranillo and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of mineral, spice, orange zest, bacon and black plum are integrated and lead to a lively palate with flavors of raspberry, plum and herbal essence. Long and spunky on the finish. Drink now–2017.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",44845
"82217","The name Septette references seven blocks planted to seven clones in the estate vineyard. The fruit flavors mix red berries and purple plums, with some tangy tropical details. It's big, plush, delicious and finished unfined and unfiltered.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",82217
"100322","This is a nicely constructed Shiraz with some cool-climate leanings. It's medium in weight, with smoky scents, plum and cherry fruit and a firm, mouthwatering finish.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",100322
"5815","Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",5815
"50481","If you think you don't like Merlot, try this one. It shows classic Napa Valley structure, with smooth, firm tannins and seductive flavors of sweet cherries, plums and currants. Delicious now with a good steak.","Red","Merlot","US",50481
"35858","Powerful and ripe, this is loaded with dark black fruit, spice from wood aging, licorice and bitter chocolate flavors. It's impressively rich, concentrated and dark in both color and feel; age it for four years.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",35858
"42791","Slightly herbal aromas veer off in the direction of grassy and rooty. This feels jagged and a bit choppy, with gritty roasted berry flavors. On the finish, that same gritty character persists and is joined by a tarry note.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",42791
"64185","This is a hearty, full-bodied red, blended with just a tease of 1% Viognier. Baked bread, plum jam and soft tannins highlight a juicy, burly celebration of high-toned acidity and leathery texture, remaining near-velvety on the palate through the lengthy, peppery finish.","Red","Syrah","US",64185
"25912","Spiced berry and plum aromas are holding in there. This is blatantly acidic and citric, with cranberry and raspberry flavors that finish tart before falling off.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",25912
"84657","Dark, rich mountain blueberry and blackberry form the core of this classically delicious Napa Valley wine from an estate vineyard. Velvety dark chocolate melts over integrated tannins and a medium-strength body, the finish lengthy, dusty and well-structured. Age through 2020–2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",84657
"27298","Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price. It's high in acidity and tough in tannins, and oak just adds a caramelized sweetness to the jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. This Syrah isn't going anywhere, so drink up.","Red","Syrah","US",27298
"25416","Restrained aromatically, this bottling shows touches of crushed lava rocks, black pepper and blackberry on the nose. Balsamic vinegar and sour cherry flavors mark the sip, with very sticky tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","US",25416
"81940","A good look at the potential of the soon-to-be official Creston appellation, this opaque wine is scented with pickled cherries, black tea and sour herbal aromas. Balsamic vinegar leads the palate, which is showing a bit of age, so drink now.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",81940
"37596","Created as an homage to the traditional powerful “black wines” that set the reputation of Cahors in Medieval times, this wine follows the old practice of heating the grape must before fermentation. The result is enormous concentration, seriously tannic ripe black fruit and considerable acidity. These are all elements that demand aging, and even at four years old this wine is just starting out. Drink from 2021 at the earliest.","Red","Malbec","France",37596
"74294","Grapes for this 100% varietal wine—the family's first estate Merlot under this name—are grown on the Grieve Family Vineyard in Lovall Valley, just above cool Carneros. Concentrated and showing integrated oak, it reveals cedar and dried herb around subtle fruit components of plum and cassis. It finishes soft and balanced in a flurry of cocoa.","Red","Merlot","US",74294
"23806","Concentrated rose petals, hibiscus and purple fruits meld with lava-rock aromas, all boosted by a touch of cola and smoke. Tart plum skins and Montgomery cherries play into the complex palate, which also shows turned earth and beef-jerky flavors.","Red","Sangiovese","US",23806
"97068","his off-dry wine has a sugary touch with flavors of ripe apricots, oranges and peaches, along with the acidity and petrol notes that Riesling is famous for.","White","Riesling","US",97068
"104774","The warm climate of the Barossa is reflected in the heavy, sweet fruit flavors. The melon, guava and honey aromas and flavors lack zip and definition but certainly don't lack for ripeness.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",104774
"3740","This barrel-fermented rosé is flat and smells more like apple juice than wine. Despite showing some tang, this is dull in the mouth, with bland orange and nectarine flavors. On the finish, it's washed out and has an iodine-like aftertaste.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",3740
"67707","Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over two-thirds of this blend with the balance Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of vanilla, cocoa, dill and cherry lead to restrained fruit and barrel flavors, with the tannins showing some grit.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",67707
"37621","This Riesling has white floral and lemon zest aromas and lemon pith and grapefruit flavors. It's nicely balanced, with a pleasantly tart finish.","White","Riesling","Luxembourg",37621
"29952","A subtle nose of lemon leads to a chorus of zesty, citrusy freshness: rind of lemon, grapefruit and mandarin make for a streamlined, concentrated and incredibly refreshing palate with a tangy moreishness. The purity of this wine shines. This is lovely now but will develop through 2020.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",29952
"100083","This intensely wood-aged wine has a creamy and spicy character. It has very ripe yellow fruits that are balanced by zingy orange zest acidity. The toast is still dominant at this stage and will soften and integrate into the fruit over the next year. It's a wine that could age and will be best from 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",100083
"58325","A ripe and sultry selection, this offers upfront oak-derived notes of vanilla, toasted nut, sweet cedar and chocolate sauce. Fruity tones of brandied cherry, mashed raspberry and blackberry preserve provide a solid backbone for the woody, spicy character. The lush, full palate offers waves of tobacco and leather that carry through to the medium-length finish.","Red","Red Blend","South Africa",58325
"98943","A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry. The body is medium in weight and intensity, with pure but basic cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Like all other parts of the wine, the finish is easy and clean, with carry-over flavors of berry fruit.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",98943
"1006","The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine. Its juicy black currant and blackberry fruits are suffused with tannins—its dry core surrounded by richness. Hints of dark chocolate and pepper come from the alcohol but certainly don't take away from the great fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",1006
"90603","Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors highlight this 100% Cab, along with plenty of sweet new oak. The tannins are bold, but ultra-refined. High alcohol lends some heat as well as a glycerine feel. It's an unctuous, delicious wine, although slightly overripe.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90603
"5832","Peach, pear, melon and vanilla aromas come with an aromatic sensation of wet rocks. Light and lifted on the palate, with honeydew, pear, lemon and stony flavors, this finishes fresh, clean and lightly powdery, with echoes of apple and pear.","White","Pinot Gris","Argentina",5832
"37968","A taste of sarsaparilla and fresh strawberry hulls combine in this soft, velvety and well-structured wine, the bouquet floral in rose petals and earthy dew. Medium to light bodied, it's a lovely sipping wine that will also pair well with food.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37968
"29073","This flashy, complex Zinfandel wants to be paired with a burger. It's just luscious in blackberry jam and teriyaki beef flavors, with tart acidity that can't wait to bite into greasy protein and fat.","Red","Zinfandel","US",29073
"57930","Aromas of green wood, vanilla and cola are followed by plump fruit flavors. The palate brings appeal but the aromas don't seem to match up.","Red","Merlot","US",57930
"6213","The wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6213
"44165","Hints of nut and spice on the nose lift flatter tones of pressed apple and pear in the palate of this medium-bodied white. Soft lemonade acidity brightens the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",44165
"32125","The great thing about Sangiovese is that it is usually food friendly, even in its simplest interpretations. Terrarossa Riserva shows slender fruit, with bright highlights of cherry and red currant. The ample acidity will cut though fatty foods and cheeses.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",32125
"17888","This is a big, gutsy Syrah. It's strong and astringent in tannins and potent in ripe, fruity blackberries and plums, with a spicy edge of smoked bacon. The overall balance testifies to a pedigreed address and superior grapegrowing. As savory as it is, it's not really ready for drinking. Hold for up to six years.","Red","Syrah","US",17888
"98637","A yeasty baked bread note leads this wine's nose before smoky oak and lushly layered blue and black fruit take over. With spice- and leather-laced flavors, it offers a wealth of brawny structure and lip-smacking succulence, finishing soft.","Red","Zinfandel","US",98637
"48819","Appeals to the popular palate with white sugar, apricot, orange, pineapple and oak flavors. The apparent sweetness suggests pairing with cured meats. A weekend brunch with a ham omelet will be fine.","White","Chardonnay","US",48819
"19093","A lush, smooth and frankly delicious Syrah that exhibits the only-in-California style. Fruit doesn't get much riper than this bottle of blueberries and chocolate. But with finely ground tannins and good acidity, it has proper structure. Drink over the next two years for freshness.","Red","Syrah","US",19093
"20157","A deliciously savory wine, brisk in lip-smacking acidity, with the strong, pure flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruits that mark this cool climate region of San Luis Obispo County. Pretty much as good as Edna Valley Chardonnay gets. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",20157
"29373","Owned by the producer, this vineyard is planted to small-cluster Dijon clones in the heart of the appellation, near San Pablo Bay. Rich and voluptuous, it's intensely oaken and decadent in tropical pineapple, guava and pear, finishing clean and full bodied.","White","Chardonnay","US",29373
"92753","This dark-colored Merlot offers reduced berry, chocolate and herbal aromas. In the mouth, it's displaying rubbery tannins. Dried berry and oak-based flavors of spice and wood grain finish with hints of clove on a finish that could use more harmony and depth.","Red","Merlot","Chile",92753

"6126","This wine's oak, toasted nut and menthol aromas carry over to its evolved palate, along with a coffee note and bracing tannins. It's shy on fruit richness and intensity.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",6126
"85808","Opens with lovely blackberry and herb aromas that suggest richness and ripeness but not overt weight. It feels lush and deep, and tastes totally pleasant and easy, with black fruit, toast and pepper flavors. A thorough and balanced blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",85808
"77005","The red wine companion to the excellent Two Vines Vineyard 10 White has got some stuffing, tannins and chewy, herbal flavors, but the fruit holds its own with flavors of wild plum and rhubarb.","Red","Red Blend","US",77005
"17275","Rich aromas of late summer are here: the ripe peel of yellow pears, luscious peach and yellow Mirabelle plum plus some dried hayflower notes. There is power and depth, along with some alcoholic heat and balancing acidity—beautiful now but it will get even better. Drink until 2020.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",17275
"66475","Aggressive aromas include rubbery notes, iodine and a touch of dried blood. This feels raw and lean, with spiced plum and raspberry flavors coming in front of a high-acid citric finish with a grassy component.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",66475
"41021","Dry and a little harsh in texture, this Pinot shows flavors of cherries, green mint candy and oak. It's dry and silky. Production was 16,663 cases.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",41021
"103974","Lightly charred cherries and plums take on additional oak tones of cocoa powder and espresso. The palate is fresher in character, boasting juicy red plum around a tight core of dusted minerals. Medium bodied and supported by grippy, sandy tannins, a shading of dark chocolate lingers on the finish of this well-balanced offering.","Red","Merlot","US",103974
"40125","The aromas are generous, with notes of red apple, melon, pear and spice. The palate is lightly creamy in feel, very varietal, with a kiss of oak providing accents.","White","Chardonnay","US",40125
"23674","This wine is full of acidity as much as red fruits. Crisp, tight and with freshness from the red currant fruits, it is ready to drink. This is one of the Vignobles Jean Queyrens et Fils wineries.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",23674
"45608","Veramar's Estate Club Viognier has a high-toned apple scent. Fat and full bodied with lots of rich cream, butter and apple cider notes, it's fairly low in acid, but high in alcohol, contributing to a finish that feels a bit dense and hot.","White","Viognier","US",45608
"102484","This wine hangs muscular cherry and berry flavors on a big framework of firm acidity and taut tannins, ready for a long haul in the cellar or tackling a rich dish like Peking duck now. Light whiffs of spicy oak lead to tangy red cherry, raspberry and cranberry flavors. Best after 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",102484
"1803","Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity.","Red","Syrah","US",1803

"11255","Oak-derived aromas of vanilla, sweet wood and toast are forward in the bouquet and mouth of this wine, but they're supported by a solid core of lush black berry, cassis and plum notes. The palate is round and mouthfilling, with a creamy texture.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Israel",11255
"91796","This is one of a range of branded wines produced by the Alliance Bourg. It is ripe with red berry fruit and spicy tannins that are beginning to soften. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",91796
"92023","A rich texture and rather ripe fruit flavors make this softer and broader in taste than many of its peers. Flavors like Fuji apple and Bartlett pear are appealing, and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy rather than crisp.","White","Pinot Gris","US",92023

"30246","Splendid from the gun, and classy. Early aromas of hard spices, mineral and matchstick announce some young oak, but that shortly dissipates, revealing a tight cherry and dark-chocolate bouquet.

Hold at least until 2006.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",30246
"21591","A standout among the winery's single-vineyard selections, this big-boned effort brings flavors of chewy cherry alongside a citrus highlight and a definite underpinning of wet stone and clay. Texturally compelling, it should age gracefully through 2024.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21591

"88953","This Pinot seems to float weightlessly on the palate, yet the flavors sink in instantly and dazzle. Suggestions of raspberries and red cherries come spiced in white pepper and cinnamon, with richer levels of Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and red licorice, all highlighted with the most perfect acidity. It's easy to fall in love with this wine and drink it now, but it can develop interesting complexities through 2020.

"33355","A fine follow-up to Seia's inaugural 2004 Clifton Hill, this again delivers ripe, concentrated flavors of plum and berry, lifted with citrus and finishing with a hint of mint. Despite the high (15.3%) alcohol, it is clean and bracing, with natural acids and very little heat in the finish. As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface.","Red","Syrah","US",33355
"94770","This is a ripe style of Champagne, rounded and rich, from a 60-40 Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend. The structure of the Pinot gives it ripe apple and Rocha pear flavors, well cut by acidity and with a soft, full, creamy aftertaste. The wine is still young and will be better drunk from 2017.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",94770
"90611","Sourced from grapes grown in the Happy Canyon area, this is a lush, ripe blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.

"26169","Morello cherry, blue flower, underbrush, white pepper, clove, cinnamon and a sprinkling of cocoa come seamlessly together in this savory and smooth wine. There's no mind-blowing complexity but it delivers just the right amount of fruit, freshness and structure for effortless drinking pleasure.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",26169
"5264","A fruity wine that is packed with red cherry and juicy plums. On top of the fruitiness, however, the acidity is prominent, which means it needs time to fill out, leaving a smoky, leathery textured aftertaste. Glass stopper.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",5264
"47021","Aged for two years in Hungarian Tokaj barrels, this wine is fresh and appealing with notes of dark plum, spice and green herbs. The fruit flavors are sweet and succulent and backed by more tannic structure than usually seen for the variety.","Red","Malbec","US",47021
"60957","Ripe, mushy plum and black cherry guts lead the way on the nose, with secondary notes of cured meat and tree bark. Medium weight and very approachable now with dusty tannins and a solid finish.","Red","Red Blend","South Africa",60957
"61004","This is made from 80% Cinsault, 10% Grenache and 10% Carignan. It has a deep pink hue and smells more like a red wine than many rosés, with hints of smoked meat, bold notes of garrigue and just a bit of berry-like fruit. It's full bodied, complex and savory—a fine rosé to serve with grilled meats.","Rosé","Rosé","France",61004
"23935","This is an attractive, floral and fragrant wine. Good acidity is well integrated into the fresh citrus and apple flavors. With poise and balance, the wine is fresh, ready as an apéritif.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",23935
"70686","Big in every way, with tons of new oak, popcorn and coffee sitting on top of dark-fruit aromas. Modern despite its incorporation of several indigenous grapes, this blend delivers a blast of roasted black cherry and plum flavors in front of a resiny finish that's dripping with menthol and molasses. Unique if a touch syrupy; it's clearly shooting for the modern style.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",70686
"7584","More pulpy and flat than ideal, but still this wine shows a lot of spirit and Rioja character. It starts with a jumbled nose of lacquer, shoe polish and licorice, while the palate is chewy and dark, with some briary notes. A good effort from a challenging vintage.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",7584
"1292","A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1292
"105384","Brambly cherry fruit carries a generous amount of vanilla and clove highlights, along with a lightly smoky aroma of Earl Grey tea. Such details bring the wine to a deliciously satisfying finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105384
"91108","A big Zin with juicy dark cherry and blackberry jammy-ness and a slight hint of cedar and clove. This wine is a chance to open but is a nice showpiece for Ruby Hill's love of and prowess with big, ripe Zins.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91108
"8922","A seriously good Zin that preserves the variety's brambly, briary wild berry and spice personality, yet crafts it with true Napa elegance. The core of cola and cherry pie is sweet, yet the finish is wonderfully dry.","Red","Zinfandel","US",8922
"48994","A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009–2012.","Red","Red Blend","US",48994
"77712","Holding 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, this wine leads with inviting aromas of blackberries, dark cherries and tar, showing a fresh, fruit-forward profile. The dense fruit flavors deliver on all of this promise with layers of complexity, spot-on balance and good length.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",77712
"95160","High acidity and soft tannins mark this flavorful red, an unusual blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's a little on the sweet side, but the raspberry, cherry, mocha and oak flavors are delicious.","Red","Grenache","US",95160
"60656","Red berry, leather and aromatic herb aromas slowly appear in the glass along with a subtle whiff of violet. The taut palate is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and star anise alongside youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",60656
"27406","Dense aromas of prunes, black plums, tobacco and vanilla bean mark the nose of this SoCal bottling. It's plump with rustic elderberry fruit at first sip, then tightens down around a black rock core, also showing smoked cedar and white pepper.","Red","Montepulciano","US",27406
"10785","Soft, rather unfocused wine, its spice and yellow fruit flavors creating a rounded warm cushion of texture. The acidity is light, a shadow behind the wine.","White","Pinot Gris","France",10785
"62254","Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",62254
"47002","The not-so-secret blend is 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Shiraz and 12% Malbec, yielding a dark plummy wine with ample palate weight and softly dusty tannins. Espresso and black olive shadings give this a savory cast, making it more an accompaniment to food than a standalone sipper. Drink now through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",47002
"34041","The wine is firm and still structured. With wood, dense tannins and just the hint of juicy black-currant fruit, it needs time. From 2019, it should be a richer fruitier wine, always with a tannic core.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",34041
"24630","Coming from arguably the grandest of the Chablis Grand Crus, this is an impressive, rich and structured wine. It is concentrated, intense with minerality, pure acidity and great fruitiness. The wine has depth and power, a ripe wine that captures the full strength of the fine vineyard. Drink from 2020.","White","Chardonnay","France",24630
"28599","There's a sour twinge on the nose that's reminiscent of sweet apple cider vinegar, but the dry, medium bodied palate is pleasant with fresh apple juice flavors and a touch of cream on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",28599
"13380","Fragrant and polished, this offers enticing aromas of spiced plum, rose, aromatic herb and menthol. The elegant, linear palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, pipe tobacco and mineral set against firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018 through 2028.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",13380
"4974","From a bubbly specialist comes this fancy wine, a blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Has very forward fruity aromas that are a combo of both varietals. It’s a bit rough, as though the bubbles aren’t fine enough, but that’s comparing it to the best French vintage Champagne, which costs a whole lot more.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","US",4974
"71180","Scratchy raspberry aromas are jammy but also green, with a strange hint of perfume. This feels chunky and rubbery, with stretchy, elastic tannins. Flavors of baked berry fruits, prune and herbs finish hot.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",71180
"81553","If there's any oak at all on this wine, it takes a very shy role in the background. The stars are ripe citrus and pear fruit, crisp acidity and a limestoney minerality. The finish is honey sweet.","White","Albariño","US",81553
"92538","Dry yet lusciously mouth filling, this is subtly floral, with a hefty dose of fresh apple flavor. It's straightforward but pleasantly quaffable. Drink now.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",92538
"99406","This wine is a blend of grapes seldom found in the state: Souzão (34%) Tinta Roriz (33%), Touriga Nacional (31%) and Tinta Cão. The aromas jump out of the glass, with notes of violets, purple fruit, freshly peeled orange, barrel spice and earth. The soft plush fruit flavors are extremely fresh and piquant, with the oak influence seeming dialed back. It's a very intriguing wine.","Red","Red Blend","US",99406
"79455","Il Cocco delivers a beautiful Brunello with an inky dark appearance and savory notes of cured meat, leather and dark fruit. There's a touch of bitter almond on the close that gives the wine brightness and crispness.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",79455
"43092","Strongly flavored, this Chardonnay marches to its own beat. Some will object to the apricot, golden currant and butterscotch tastes as atypical, but they're quite complex and original. It finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Drink over the next 3–4 years.","White","Chardonnay","US",43092
"65803","Aromas of golden raisins, fig, licorice and vanilla lead to full-feeling dark-fruit flavors, with the tannins bringing a sense of grittiness. Time might smooth things, but the aromas already seem a bit dried out.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",65803
"30756","This vintage mixes fruit from Red Mountain and Alder Ridge (in the Horse Heaven Hills). Aromatic and soft, it's a five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, half Cabernet Sauvignon, and it carries that grape's herbal stamp. Tannins are a bit earthy, but the time in bottle has smoothed their rough edges. Drink up!","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",30756
"79629","Apple and mineral aromas are basic but clean, and the palate is fresh and lithe, with little to no extra weight. Flavors of dry apple and fresh corn work well, and while the finish is short and shy, it's crisp and clean. A simple wine with light fruit and easy drinkability.","White","White Blend","Spain",79629
"89582","Sourced entirely from the Benches vineyard, this screw-capped wine shows a lot of SO2 when first opened, so plan on decanting if at all possible. Once it clears up it's a leesy, fresh white wine with flavors of apples and pears, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice.","White","Pinot Gris","US",89582
"84726","This is a well-priced Pinot Bianco that opens with a clean, bright bouquet of melon, pear, stone fruit and white flower. It offers impressive smoothness of texture and a bright, food-friendly disposition.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",84726
"91225","Very elegant, it opens with refined aromas of rose petals, lychee and a hint of juicy citrus fruit. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe pink grapefruit and steely mineral notes accented with a spicy note of white pepper.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",91225
"6391","Very soft notions of ripe, yellow pear with floral overtones create a softer, luscious but completely dry palate. An ideal wine for those who like structure but mellow flavors. The savory edge of Grüner makes itself felt around the edges but never dominates and provides spicy length.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",6391
"58393","A big textured, smooth wine, sweet fruits with firm tannins finished with dark perfumes. It is a blockbuster, thankfully without high alcohol, balanced in its richness. A barbecue wine, ready to drink now.","Red","Shiraz","Portugal",58393
"98235","This opens with aromas of cranberry, white pepper and a whiff of pipe tobacco. The firm palate offers wild cherry, clove and star anise framed in tightly knit but refined tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98235
"79619","Beautifully perfumed with ripe pommelo, orange blossoms and a spray of fresh lemon zest. A rich, luscious mouthfeel on the palate is balanced with bright grapefruit acidity and a refreshing minerality. Finishes dry with a zesty lemon rind astringency.","White","Pinot Gris","US",79619
"17767","A very rich wine, showing all the opulence of 2009. Black plums, damsons and wood flavors are already combined and integrated. The acidity in all this richness and power seems low, leaving the tannins to support aging.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",17767
"84533","Light aromas of toast, melon and butter lead to sleek stone and tropical fruit flavors that persist on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",84533
"90669","Savory, spicy aromas of saucy fruit, fennel and sausage are gamy, herbal and interesting. This is plush and big on the palate, with weight and depth. Flavors of spiced plum and berry are ripe given that 2011 was a cool year for warm-weather varieties like this.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",90669
"70201","Estate-grown and fruit-driven, this lush, pear-flavored Pinot Gris is dotted with pretty cinnamon and allspice highlights. Forward and nicely balanced, it has the texture and weight to handle rich sauces, much like a big Chardonnay, but without all the new oak.","White","Pinot Gris","US",70201
"103355","Savory and crisp, this pretty blush wine has flavors of rose petals, herb tea, strawberries and black pepper. It's pretty dry, and fairly full-bodied for a rosé.","Rosé","Rosé","US",103355
"16527","Spiced cranberry fruit highlights this tightly-wound young Pinot Noir. Some hard raspberry candy flavors continue through the mid-palate, with chewy acidity leading into a tight, tangy finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",16527
"100325","Subdued notes of blackberry and dark cherry, cigar box and undergrowth lead the aromas on this Bordeaux-style blend. It has a supple core, which is framed by sinewy tannins and balanced acids. The finish is medium in length and grippy, ending on a spiced-cherry flavor.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",100325
"47776","This Chardonnay has a prominent scent of dusty chalkboard, with background tones of toasted butterscotch, sweat and pear. The flavor intensity is subdued on this light- to medium-bodied wine, with a discreet note of hydrogen peroxide that surfaces late.","White","Chardonnay","US",47776
"52304","Quite earthy in profile with hints of smoke, petroleum and fresh green herbs, there's a distinct minerality in this off-dry Riesling that's compelling. Brisk lime-juice acidity and a hint of citrus rind bitterness accentuates the dry finish.","White","Riesling","US",52304
"39430","Very inviting aromas of lemon curd, buttercream, white peach and pear blossom prove quite ripe but far from overdone on this blend of 40% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne and 20% Viognier. There is thinly focused but prevalent acidity to the sip, where peaches, lemon and cream flavos thrive. A well balanced and rich white Rhône blend, which is harder to pull off than it sounds.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",39430
"79138","Muted aromatics tease on the nose before chewy texture and full-bodied weight enter the scene. Deceptively light and airy at first, the wine then delves into a hearty taste of marzipan and oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",79138
"55929","This wine leads with lovely touch of flint, accentuating its green pear and lemon zest aromas. On the palate, it's light and dry, with a phenolic character that lends both texture and structure, adding complexity to all the freshness.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",55929
"14492","This has a curious caramel aroma from the wood aging. It's tough and extracted, a powerhouse of hard tannins without enough fruit.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",14492
"19179","So luscious now, it's hard not to finish the bottle, especially with a grilled steak, lamb chop or mushroom risotto. This is the winery's best Pinot in years, rich in cola, red currants and sandalwood, smoothly tannic, and aged in rich, toasty oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19179
"56112","Using grapes sourced from old vines, this is dark and concentrated. It's dominated at the start by firm, dry tannins, with its power coming from its dark, brooding fruit and dense structure. Age for at least four years.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",56112
"48226","A top choice in a generally weak category, this Pinot shows pretty strawberry and raspberry scents that yield to earth and cherry flavors in the mouth. The palate is well balanced and followed by a strawberry-infused finish. Although this wine shows quite a bit of promise, some slightly gummy notes on the nose and palate preclude a higher score at this time.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48226
"7897","This is a dreamy creamy white founded in stony mineral and juicy acidity that shows a mix of baked apple, pineapple and melon. A tease of green olive provides a briny, salty edge to its tense balance. A lingering hint of vanilla oak figures prominently on the lengthy floral finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",7897
"95163","A really nice Cabernet that shows how well Paso Robles can produce this kind of wine while keeping prices modest. Made from 100% of the variety, it's dry and rich in tannins, with interesting flavors of blackberries, currants, anise and smoky oak. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95163
"52883","A medium-dry Vinho Verde, this is light and fresh without being quite crisp enough. Well chilled, though, it makes a lively and fresh apéritif.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",52883
"69407","From biodynamic producer Marcel Lapierre, this is probably as good as it got in 2007. It's a rich wine, concentrated, although the crisp fruits of the year tend to dominate. There are raspberry flavors, very pure, very fresh, but with some good depth of flavor.","Red","Gamay","France",69407
"47653","Heavy berry aromas are slightly raisiny, indicating modest overripeness. A plump, soft palate isn't surprising, while loamy, jammy berry and plum flavors are a bit herbal. A finish with jammy weight, spice and a recurrence of raisin marks the close.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",47653
"83758","Aromas of toast, hazelnut, ripe berry and spice lead the nose while the structured palate doles out succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, fennel and mineral. Fine-grained tannins leave a firm finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",83758
"48029","Dark berry, toasted hazelnut and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The tightly wound palate is still rather closed and on the lean side in terms of fruit richness, but slowly reveals sour cherry, licorice and a note of ground pepper. A tannic backbone provides structure.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",48029
"100691","Some occasions call for a wine that shows the highest levels of quality but also has a touch of friendliness or informality that makes it more approachable. Barolo Vigneto Arborina is such a wine. It offers elegant Nebbiolo tones of red fruit and blue flower with oaky spice and smoke.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",100691
"65150","High alcohol, clocking in at 16.5% by volume, is the overwhelming fact of this Zin. It gives it a jalapeño pepper heat, but also is responsible for the fantastically ripe cherry, raisin and rum punch deliciousness. Partner it with barbecue.","Red","Zinfandel","US",65150
"92311","There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection. The oak and tannin structure is polished and fine, but acidity is a little low, so it's not an ager. Drink now through 2009 for its sheer lusciousness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",92311
"24188","A 100% varietal wine from the producer's estate, the grapes planted in rocky volcanic soils, this wine showcases a thicket of blueberry and smoky meat, with a high-toned backbone of acidity helping to keep it from becoming overbearing. Ripe, the tannins are soft and chewy.","Red","Syrah","US",24188
"88674","Fresh, crisp and minerally on the nose, this has green apple and melon aromas. It feels fresh, juicy, light and refreshing, with high-toned white-fruit flavors as well as notes of grapefruit, herb and lime. Clean on the finish.","White","Verdejo","Spain",88674
"27663","The floral perfume of this cool-climate bottling is intense—all lavender accented with black pepper, white pepper and thyme. Tart black plum skin flavors lead the palate, building towards savory elements that recall dried purple flowers, thyme, rosemary and black pepper. Medium bodied and dense, it will be versatile with food.","Red","Syrah","US",27663
"37369","Apple, citrus, lemon-lime and yeasty aromas lead to a composed palate. This tastes dry, peppery and like ripe yellow apples. A comported, mildly tangy finish doesn't overwhelm.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",37369
"10286","Crushed mineral and dried sage aromas belie the intensity of fresh nectarine and apricot flavors in this spry, invigorating wine. Striking acidity lends a delicate, lacy mouthfeel accentuated by a sheen of minerality.","White","Riesling","Germany",10286
"10196","There's zero doubt about this Chardonnay's ripeness. The nose is warm, honeyed and a bit leaden. Round in the mouth, it offers tropical flavors of orange and nectarine. On the finish, a buttery note blends with residual citrus fruit.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",10196
"104213","A tangy, zesty wine with a strongly mineral texture, this is fruity and fresh. It's full of green plum, herbal and gooseberry flavors. With its texture and structure, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",104213
"101755","High levels of acidity give this wine a tight, eye-watering character. The fruit was probably not ripe.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",101755
"81051","Made from 75% Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine saw just a 25% new French oak, putting the focus squarely on the fruit. Aromas of spice, prune, medicine cabinet and cherry cola are followed by luscious, full-bodied black-fruit flavors that bring some warmth on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",81051
"4218","The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine. Drink 2020–2030.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Austria",4218
"9423","Thick, rich and almost cordial-like, this has generous fruit and oak components. It's ready to be paired with a peppered steak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",9423
"325","Formerly doing business as “Shiraz,” this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors. Not timid by any means but also nothing out of the ordinary.","Red","Syrah","Chile",325
"29273","Solid layers of tannin partner with black currant fruit. This is structured, dark and very dry at the moment, although it will give a more rounded character as it ages. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",29273
"39322","This thrilling auslese starts off with intriguing spicy, musky aromas, then moves easily into flavors of pear, melon, pineapple and even red berries on the palate. It somehow comes across as plump, yet crytalline and pure, with a long, fruit-driven finish. Drink now–2030.","White","Riesling","Germany",39322
"36688","Pleasing aromas of a warm croissant mix with sharper hibiscus, rose petals, cola and strawberry on the nose of this wine. The palate shows rose petals and tart raspberry fruit, then gives way to more bitter elements of tar and sour cherries.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36688
"90738","There's a filigreed delicacy to this late-release 2012 Gewürztraminer, yet it's powerfully persistent, bursting with sweet, almost tropical fruit flavors. Zesty acidity and whispers of pollen and earth lend a savory complexity that's beguiling, sip after sip.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",90738
"54585","Pineapple and mango dominate this full-bodied, ripe wine. Soft and given a lift by lime juice, it is a well-balanced blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires. The aftertaste is fresh and fruity.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",54585
"64244","This full-bodied Shiraz comes out of the chute a bit tarry and reductive, but opens up to show complex aromas of grilled meat, cola and espresso, with flavors of coffee and black olives. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins, but still may not be the longest-lived vintage. Drink now or cellar through 2015.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",64244
"52807","A softly juicy wine, this is missing structure while it has plenty of fruit. It's ripe, rich and juicy; a pleasure to drink in 2–3 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",52807
"64856","This is a no-fussy, watery wine from the Forlì area of Italy (located on the Adriatic flank of the peninsula) that does a good job of washing down informal foods and keeping your palate refreshed. Its measured aromas include dried hay, soft yellow fruit with some nutty tones in the background for additional dimension. The mouthfeel is quick and lean.","White","White Blend","Italy",64856
"31728","Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",31728
"59532","New oak takes the lead on the nose of this wine, with notes of vanilla and toffee followed by cranberry and cherry. It's high octane, with a concentrated cherry flavor and alcoholic warmth.","Red","Syrah","US",59532
"5824","Reserved aromatically, this wine from the longtime Santa Barbara producer shows bits of plum, hibiscus and graphite on the nose. The palate is surprisingly lush and punchy, with plum and other dark purple-fruit flavors as well as licorice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5824
"89175","Big, structured tannins lie over the ripe fruit. The wine has a dense character, the young tannins dominant. Given a year, the fine fruit will come through to give a sweeter blackberry character.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",89175
"68183","The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price.","Red","Syrah","US",68183
"68325","A rare Cabernet Franc from Merry-vale, and a spectacular one. They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",68325
"104249","This Viognier takes the variety's exotic tropical fruit and orange flavors, combines them with minerals, and finishes off with a crisp bite of acidity. The result is a rich, elegant wine, with a hint of honeyed sweetness.","White","Viognier","US",104249
"106581","Maldonado is set in a fairly cool area of the Napa Valley, almost as far south as one can go. This resulting wine reflects that tension of minerality and crisp mouthfeel while providing a decadence of spiced apple and lime. Light and sublimely textured, it's subtle and sophisticated.","White","Chardonnay","US",106581
"1020","There's an interesting note of honey or maple syrup that gives this Riserva a uniquely smooth and supple style. Fruit aromas recall dried prunes, fig and currants. The wine offers elegant, fine texture in the mouth.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",1020
"27311","Refreshingly quaffable, this off-dry Riesling juxtaposes juicy, sweet melon and peach flavors with fresh tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk, fringed with a delicious bristle of lime pith.","White","Riesling","Germany",27311
"44110","Minty and light, the fruit here does not seem to have obtained optimal ripeness, even for rosé. Scents and flavors suggest pine needle and wintergreen rather than any hint of berry or melon.","Rosé","Rosé","US",44110
"91439","A heady, minty nose is joined by fuller fruit of green and yellow pear. On the palate, highlights of pepper appear amidst lemon and grapefruit peel. This is sleek and slender, with wonderfully zesty concentration and brisk freshness. Take your time drinking this, there is a lot going on.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",91439
"28892","This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",28892
"10113","This famed single vineyard on its steep slope above Mareuil-sur-Aÿ produces a warm, always elegant wine. This 1999 is softer than some vintages, while still having a power and texture to go with fruit that is now maturing, giving a yeasty final character. Drink now, or age another few years.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",10113
"35644","Light and bright, this fruity wine has a more bitter element that gives a sharper character that will hopefully round out. At the back, plenty of acidity leaves a crisp aftertaste.","White","Chardonnay","France",35644
"25610","A blend from two sites—one in the Sebastopol Hills and the other in the heart of the appellation—this is a high-toned expression of earthiness over fruit, brimming in cardamom and mushroom scents.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25610
"84394","Terrale translates as “product of the earth,” and that’s about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.","White","White Blend","Italy",84394
"101842","This elegant and detailed Pinot Gris offers fresh floral accents around spicy, toasty, well-mixed fruit. Pear and orange fruit flavors carry just a slight hint of honey, and the concentrated finish extends into a long, clean fade-out.","White","Pinot Gris","US",101842
"88995","Fiery on first blush, this then displays aromas of plum, leather, tobacco and cheesy oak. It feels fresh and not the least bit fat or flabby, with cassis, raspberry, olive, cocoa and mint flavors. The finish is composed, dry and lightly herbal. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Carignan.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",88995
"101390","An 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this shows a pristine, polished bouquet that's composed of black fruit, rum cake, licorice, tobacco and spice. The ripe fruit and cassis notes on the finish add softness and heft. This is elegant and complex, especially in the mouth.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",101390
"77909","Clay and minty cola aromas give nuance to the soft, dark, perfectly ripe blueberry fruit on the nose of this wine. Fine-grained but sticky tannins and a pinch of acidity frame the sip, where dark-roast espresso, beef char and cigar smoke flavors reign.","Red","Merlot","US",77909
"62925","This forward wine opens with aromas of dried plum marinated in spirits, fleshy black cherry, baking spice and chopped mint that follow through to the warm, full-bodied palate. Velvety tannins support the rich flavors.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",62925
"4718","This winery is one of the region's bright spots, in this case offering expertly layered touches of vanilla, caramel, cappuccino, blueberry and a touch of oregano in the blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot. Cocoa nibs, coffee, black cherry, dill, bay leaf and black olive pop on the palate, where the lingering acidity ensures aging potential.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",4718

"16565","This wine comes from vines south of the Mont Sainte-Victoire and close to the edge of the Aix-en-Provence region. The cool vineyard site helps the wine keep extreme freshness. Plenty of wild strawberry flavors are lifted by acidity and a refreshing citrus edge.","Rosé","Rosé","France",16565
"90025","Plummy yet cool, with a greenish, floral note that adds lift and interest to the dark-fruit aromas and flavors. This is a bit austere and dusty, but long on the finish, so drink 2018–2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",90025
"59944","There's a slightly unripe vegetal note to this Pinot. Despite some good black raspberries and currants and oak, that green note persists, modulating the wine's pleasures. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59944
"12974","Ripe cherry aromas swirl into graphite minerality, sweet wood and sagebrush scents in this delicious Jim Clendenen wine. The density on the palate is just about perfect, as is the tannic tension and mouth-cleansing acidity, with rich flavors of chemise, very ripe raspberry and elderberry juice proving quite sultry and addictive.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12974
"8139","This wine's barrel spice, barnyard, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors tinged with a strong, distracting gamy note.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",8139
"39151","Red berry and plum aromas form the base of this wine's fresh, uncomplicated bouquet. It feels juicy and bright, with good layering and aggressive flavors of berry and plum. The finish is dry and snappy, with mild oak and spice flavors.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",39151
"15932","There's a lot going on here with notes of orange peel, fruit compote, flowers, and chocolate. It's lighter in style, showing the elegance of the 2011 vintage, with tart fruit flavors and a tacky feel to the tannins","Red","Syrah","US",15932
"68431","Approachable and harmonious, this Cabernet offers leather and barnyard notes on a restrained nose while plum and earth on the palate are surrounded by creamy-soft tannins. Surprisingly long finish. Try with roasted veal.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",68431
"58963","Violet, plum, leather and baking spice aromas merge on this easygoing red. The no-fuss palate offers black cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside polished but rather fleeting tannins. Drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58963
"53087","A typical medium-bodied Côtes du Rhône, the 2007 Bastide de Beauvert features aromas of cherry, clove and sweaty leather, and flavors that run along similar lines. Mature; drink now.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",53087
"25752","Lots of ripe, flashy black currant, cherry, licorice, plum jam and smoky oak flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend. It's rich in tannins, and a little soft, but delicious. You can drink it now, but you can also cellar it through 2019 to let it slowly change.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",25752
"25441","This is a remarkably detailed Cabernet that shows off everything Napa has to give in the way of flash and richness. It's dry, yet lush with ripe blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors and plenty of toasty new oak. The tannins are as soft and complex as any in the world, making this wine beautiful to drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25441
"71065","This Niven family project pairs cooler climate Edna Valley Syrah with 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petite Sirah from warmer Paso Robles. Raspberry sorbet, blackberry, loam, spearmint and rose aromas come across as tart and fruity. The palate shows crushed gravel-like minerality, opening into dried strawberry fruit, thyme and pepper flavors. Fun yet serious.","Red","Red Blend","US",71065
"2138","The gravel soil on this Lévèque family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age. It is fruity now, hinting at apricots as well as citrus. It can be drunk now for its freshness, although wait until late 2016 for it to develop greater depths.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",2138
"92637","Made by winemaker Georgetta Dane, this white is awash in kumquat and vanilla, the medium-bodied layers of texture soft and round and accessible to a broad range of palates.","White","Chardonnay","US",92637
"72855","A clumsy wine. While there's some good blackberry fruit, the mouthfeel is sharp and edgy, suggesting green stems and pips resulting in hard tannins. Doesn't seem likely to age out.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72855
"44998","From old vines, this is the estate wine of Carvalhas. Black in color, it is hugely rich, dense and brooding. The wine is still young, pushed forward by tannins as much as fruit and packed with a concentrated structure. Spice at the end and a dry aftertaste need time to soften. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",44998
"49332","Bold, ripe fruit and chocolate notes open the nose of this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The wine is layered and rich, with lingering tones of tobacco and sweet spice.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",49332
"22645","Broad scents of honeydew, candied lemon and orchard fruit mark the nose, with an underpinning of toasted nut. The palate is medium bodied, with balanced acidity and apple flavor.","White","Viognier","US",22645

"22530","Truffle, forest floor, baked plum and cake spice aromas mingle with whiffs of new leather and pipe tobacco on this bold full-bodied red. The enveloping palate seamlessly combines concentration and finesse, doling out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mocha alongside big velvety tannins that give the finish nice grip and a polished texture. This will give decades of enjoyment. Drink 2020–2037.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",22530
"91844","Prunar is a deep and sophisticated Pinot Bianco (aged 50-50 in large oak casks and stainless steel) that excels in terms of mouthfeel. It delivers a long, creamy finish accented by tones of apricot, pear and grapefruit.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",91844
"41736","A fine, everyday Merlot, soft and approachable, with ripe berry, cherry, cola and oak flavors. The tannins are pretty. Drink up.","Red","Merlot","US",41736

"74914","A touch of smoked pork meets with red cherries, cola and black licorice on the nose of this small-batch wine out of Templeton by Will Persall. Bacon fat and blackberry-maple syrup flavors make for a delicious palate, with lots of lively acidity that gives balance and keeps the tongue tingling.","Red","Zinfandel","US",74914
"42258","The 2009 vintage was a warm, dry one in the southern Rhône, lending itself to the production of rich dessert wines like this one. Plum and chocolate notes dominate, but there's also complexity in the form of cinnamon and clove. It's full bodied and softly tannic, with lingering notes of cocoa powder and dried spice on the finish.","Red","Grenache","France",42258
"12527","Richly extracted black cherry and cassis flavors flood the palate of this bold bruising Cabernet Franc. It's a nuanced wine despite its voluptuousness, accented by hints of leather, spice and lavender. Tannins are big and unyielding now but ripe enough to integrate with age. Hold till 2020.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",12527
"33986","The so-called Northern Whites are Gewürztraminer, Müller-Thurgau, Pinot Gris and Riesling. They make a comfortable blend, with floral aromas and plump peach and apple fruit. Though finished dry, it has appealing fruit sweetness.","White","White Blend","US",33986
"10158","A strongly perfumed wine, this is soft and just off-dry in character with some sucrosity. Crisp, fresh berry fruits are laced with acidity and finished with orange zest.","Rosé","Rosé","France",10158
"97325","This Chardonnay opens with a strong blast of oak resin that frankly doesn't smell very natural or nice. The palate feel is heavy and mealy, while flavors of resiny oak and salt lack fruit. The finish is much the same: salty and oaky.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",97325
"62776","Smoke and char notes lend a savory, dark tone to cheerful red-cherry and sweet-spice flavors in this oaky, full-bodied Bordeaux blend. The palate is penetrating with juicy, primary fruit, but finishes a bit green and woody.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",62776
"6399","Alluring aromas of blue flower, leather, menthol, dark berry, baking spice and a balsamic note lead the way on this full-bodied, elegant red.

Drink through 2023.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",6399
"22778","With 35% new French oak, this wine is dominated by the vanilla, buttered toast and caramel of wood. Underneath all that are pineapple, lemon and pear fruit flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",22778
"34046","The nose of this wine is soft and toasty, with notes of sweet cream and butter. The creamy mouthfeel offers bursts of buttered popcorn, pineapple and toasted Challah. It's a nice choice if you like a round, buttery Chardonnay. The flavors, however, don't linger on the finish and instead turn slightly bitter.","White","Chardonnay","US",34046
"50719","A thick, pasty wine with considerable tannins and a heavy-handed mouthfeel. Flavors are weedy and generic berry. Not going anywhere.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50719
"81054","Fruity, buttery aromas are followed by a generously fruit-filled flavor, smooth texture and buttery aftertaste. It's a well-balanced and well-rounded wine of medium body, and has a tasty finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",81054
"38496","Tropical in personality, with a leanness of pineapple and guava, this wine holds a concentration of oak-influenced flavor and texture at its heart. It ends generously sultry in sweet Tahitian vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",38496
"69951","Winemaker Chris Camarda is antiformulaic; his wines in 2008 feature radically different blends from the 2007s. This is a third each Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cab Franc. It reflects the vineyard's penchant for tart berry fruit set atop astringent, mineral-driven tannins. It's tight and dense, with vertical power. Flavors roll gracefully into a medium-length finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",69951
"2349","Full of crisp fruit, this cru wine is bright with red-berry flavors. It is light and with a cool character that comes from the high altitude of the vineyards. There is an edgy texture that keeps the wine together. Drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",2349
"50372","Intriguing due to its aromatic complexity, this wine offers up caramel, honey, citrus and brown sugar notes that slide into a crisp palate that has sweet flavors but little residual sugar. Medium, pear-accented finish. Drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",50372
"34834","A dry, but rich, vanilla-and-cream-flavored rosé that shows soft tannins, ripe strawberry and full red plum flavors. The aftertaste is soft, with little acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",34834
"34562","Baked blueberry pie, vanilla and anise notes are quite inviting, albeit more cooked than fresh on the nose. That baked-fruit character paints the palate too, with black plum, black cherry and vanilla-laced fudge, showing prettier lavender touches on the edge.","Red","Syrah","US",34562
"18053","Initial whiffs of spring ramps and dried herbs turn brighter and fresher with aeration on this light-bodied dry Riesling. Tasted quite young, it's a bit wild still with sharp, slightly jagged acidity juxtaposing bursts of pristine lemon and lime. Its tautness and savory complexities are attractive though, and likely to meld with maturity.","White","Riesling","US",18053
"79911","Apple, mineral and mild briny aromas are complex and interesting. Firm in body, with cutting acidity, this brut nature is bone dry, with white stone-fruit flavors that lean towards neutral except for a hint of salt. Minerality and cleansing acidity push an air-tight finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",79911
"73184","This opens with aromas of blue and red flower, underbrush and mature, dark-skinned berry. The tense palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise tobacco and mocha alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A note of chopped herb closes the finish. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",73184
"1639","Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish.","Red","Syrah","Spain",1639
"101803","A pear-flavored Pinot Gris from Yakima valley fruit. The fruit is limned with well-defined skin flavors, and the wine has a light tawny color. It starts off well, then stops short with a plastic, Band-Aid finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",101803
"77716","Lilac and violet hang with blackberries, black plums and sweet mocha on this purple chiffon-cake scented wine  from winemaker Ryan Pease. The blend of 55% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and and 3% Counoise is full and silky on the palate, with olallieberry fruits, proving juicy but not jammy or overpowering.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",77716
"17471","This wine is light in body, fruity and floral in flavor and smooth on the palate. Blended from seven varietals, it has peach and jasmine aromas, very generous fruit flavors that flirt with sweetness and a lush mouthfeel.","White","White Blend","US",17471
"14123","There's an appealing nose of ripe yellow stone fruit, spice and an earthy minerality. Medium-sweet with a lovely rich texture, fleshy, but well balanced by the refreshing acidity. Smooth and broad across the palate, showing strong flavor intensity that lingers. Long, with a persistent layered, minerally finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","Germany",14123
"1202","This varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's muscular and lushly layered, with spicy leather and tobacco notes accented by a delicate touch of violet and supported by firm, grippy tannin. Drink now through 2033.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1202
"55510","As the name suggests, this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon does taste big and bold, but it also tastes hot and lopsided. It has a Port-like consistency, with notes of charred sesame seed, chocolate and dark cherry that lack precision.","Red","Red Blend","US",55510
"30161","This wine opens with a rich nose of graham cracker and a concentrated midpalate, which becomes full bodied and toasty in oak. Around a gravelly texture are flavors of green olive, brine and baked pear, a mix of savory and sweet that finishes with a dash of nutmeg.","White","Chardonnay","US",30161
"19152","A dry, tannic and severe Syrah. It's tart and sandpapery in the mouth, with a scoury mouthfeel, and although you'll find some cherries and currants, there's not enough richness to counterbalance the toughness.","Red","Syrah","US",19152
"81295","This arresting wine has aromas of forest floor, strawberry and cola. It's light and lithe in feel yet still richly flavored with a lingering finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81295
"81721","The aromas of ground granite, dark raspberries, plum and pencil lead have not yet fully unfurled but still offer immediate allure. Flavors are saturated and layered, with the tannins providing some heft. It's a serious wine that provides a whole lot of enjoyment and that should benefit from time in the cellar.","Red","Syrah","US",81721
"26917","A botrytized wine that definitely shows honey and ripe fruit, along with the ethereal acidity. The wine is sweet and fresh, the richness only hinted at in the mouth. A library wine that is only produced in years when there is botrytis.","White","Riesling","Austria",26917
"82654","Comprised of equal parts sweet, toasty oak, brisk acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors, this Chardonnay is successfully made in the popular style. It's creamy and rich, with a vanilla honey sweetness. Easily Ventana's best Chard ever.","White","Chardonnay","US",82654
"24968","Tannic and dry, it's one tough wine, stinging the gums. But it has plenty of ripe blackberry, coffee, pepper and toasty flavors, and should age well. Hold onto it until 2019.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",24968
"102301","While the nose is shy at first, the palate reveals abundant red and green apples, with some juicy yellow pear around the edges. Texture and structure strike a balance with the lovely, clean fruit. It's a delicious, textured, earthy Riesling made for food.","White","Riesling","France",102301
"72040","Thickly textured and dense, this has plenty of ripe fruit, tobacco, cola and anise-like aromas. It has the power to cut through cooked beans, and it would pair nicely with a heaping serving of barley, bacon and legume soup.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",72040
"52957","It's difficult to see how this wine can register alcohol almost 15%. Flavors are thin, green and tannic, with hardly a hint of fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52957
"38774","Caramelized oak and tangerine jam flavors give this Chardonnay a honeyed sweetness that would appeal consumers who enjoy modern-style wines. The high alcohol gives it a peppery burn.","White","Chardonnay","US",38774
"90812","Initial aromas are scratchy and piercing, but with airing this blend of Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon offers intriguing notes of vanilla, tobacco and charcoal. In the mouth, this is undeniably thick and tannic. Flavors are saturated and suggest blackberry and cassis. The finish leans toward syrupy but maintains acidity for balance. Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",90812
"39818","For the price, a pretty good Chardonnay. It's dryish to sweet, with pineapple, orange, buttered toast and vanilla flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",39818
"34489","One sip of this blend is all it takes to conclude that it's quite a good wine. Dry and balanced, with smooth tannins, it houses blackberry, black cherry, cassis, teryaki beef and sandalwood flavors. Gains extra points for sheer elegance of structure. Now–2013.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",34489
"10411","In this very basic wine, applesauce aromas are followed by a plump, somewhat citrusy feeling palate. Flavors of nectarine are good and clean, while the finish is solid.","White","White Blend","Spain",10411
"75836","Still in need of cellar aging, this shows aromas of toasted almond and vanilla backed by notes of dried fruit, honey and cassis. The mouthfeel is beautifully firm and solid. Drink after 2018.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",75836
"41191","This is a fluid, fruit-laden, well-balanced blend. Spicy and herbal purple fruits are highlighted with cayenne pepper, chocolate and a pleasing hint of violets.","Red","Red Blend","US",41191
"17533","Sinewy leather, tobacco and dried herb intertwine on the thick, full-bodied palate in this unfussy red that should appeal to a broad spectrum of tastes.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",17533
"69414","White floral and lemon zest scents perfume this zippy, light-footed Pinot Blanc. It's not a deeply concentrated wine but offers sunny yellow apple and citrus flavors, warmed by a touch of caramelized sugar. The finish is crisp and slightly mineral.","White","Pinot Blanc","Germany",69414
"55916","A family estate just outside Aix-en-Provence has produced a textured and dense wine. It has great fruitiness along with a spice and pepper character that brings out a more complex side. It's definitely for food.","Rosé","Rosé","France",55916
"101774","Big and rich, this full-bodied wine has an aroma like the crema on an espresso and abundant dark-fruit flavors. A wonderful, mouthcoating texture keeps the flavors lingering on the finish. The sense of layering and creaminess that extends after a sip is captivating.","Red","Malbec","US",101774
"94986","This is a spicy, softly lush offering of Cabernet sourced from a tiny part of the Larkmead Vineyard in northern Napa Valley. Black and red currant play off one another well, before revealing subtle layers of dried herb and tobacco leaf, the finish as cushy as the opening and midpalate of the wine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",94986
"26966","Peppery! Mounds of freshly crushed black peppercorns erupt from the glass, giving the blackberries and currants a spicy finish. Shows real class and elegance for the price.","Red","Syrah","US",26966
"71115","This is a well-balanced Petite Sirah, with chewy but proportionate tannins, a broadly fruity, black cherry core and nuanced highlights of apricot. The finish does a quick fade.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",71115
"62914","At the start, there are sweet touches of chestnut honey and barbecue spice, followed by notes of candied fruit, cassis and red currant. This hearty offering would pair with glazed ham or pork shoulder with dried plums.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",62914
"51371","If you like that slightly sour, green hit of gooseberry in your Sauvignon Blanc, this one's for you. Beyond that, it's dry, and offers citrus, green apple and vanilla flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",51371

"29167","There's a pleasantly oxidized element to this wine from Michael Mooney (who also makes Chateau Margene from Paso Robles' Creston district). Aromas recall honey and dried apricots, mangos and bananas. The flavors carry that forward, with caramelized apples, melted marshmallow and all types of dried fruit, but with lots of acidic verve too.","White","Chardonnay","US",29167
"66858","They muscled up this Sangiovese with some Cabernet, which gives it a fuller body and sturdier tannins than usual. Nonetheless, it has Sangiovese's silkiness and red cherry and leather flavors.","Red","Sangiovese","US",66858
"74961","McManis excels at making good wines at competitive prices and this is a prime example. It's smooth, easy-drinking Pinot Noir, with cherry-vanilla layers from start to finish.

"30804","One of the riper of the Highland Estate's current crop of Cabernets, the Hawkeye Mountain shows intense varietal character.

"377","A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors. A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it needs serious aging, so don't drink before 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",377
"65656","Blackberry and animal aromas precede a rubbery, tannic, full-bodied palate. This rugged, black-colored Malbec pumps out big blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty but short finish with emerging oak.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",65656

"18596","Paola Gloder's estate can do better than this, especially in a vintage like 1997. The wine is already showing signs of aging and it has a lightweight character. The fruit is pleasant enough, with soft tannins and ripeness, but it should be more exciting. Tasted twice.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",18596
"23915","Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah. Well-integrated layers of citrus, berry, roasted coffee beans, vanilla cookie and Graham cracker combine into a most accessible, yet complex wine. It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3–4 years.","Red","Syrah","US",23915
"79934","Hayflowers and savory lovage and arugula notes, inflected with piquant lime zest create an irresistibly spicy palate of such lightness and ease, there is a spring in the step of this light but intensely flavoured wine. If you want spicy refreshment, look no further.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",79934
"102019","Full of the concentration lacking in so many Soaves, this single-vineyard wine is intense, with ripe toast and nut flavors. The fruit has a touch of honeyed botrytis, balanced with a light layer of acidity.","White","White Blend","Italy",102019
"94796","Leesy aromas of pear, apple and vanilla are pure and generous, with intensity. Layered and elegant on the palate, this was made entirely from free-run juice and tastes of dry apricot, citrus and apple. A note of spicy white pepper rises up on a minerally finish. Drink this winning Albariño now.","White","Albariño","Spain",94796
"52036","Monbazillac, with its impressive castle, is part of the Bergerac region that makes some beautiful dessert wines. This wine, with its refreshing balance between acidity and rich honeyed flavors, conveys Seville orange marmalade and lemon acidity, with a smooth, botrytis aftertaste. Drink now, or better age until 2017.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",52036
"21966","The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard. Lovely in every way, it opens in rose petals and a subtlety of Asian five-spice, before a succulence of cranberry, rhubarb and orange unleash a fullness of fruit and lush texture on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21966
"77590","All stainless steel fermented, and showing a bit more alcohol than the companion reserve, this carries similar flavors of cantaloupe, pear and peach. The core is smooth and rounded off, with just a hint of flesh and herb.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",77590
"28432","Cerasuolo di Vittoria is one of the most exciting red wines to emerge from southern Italy in recent years. This is made with organic fruit, and it shows bright tones of raspberry and cassis, with some tones of toasted almond and light spice at the back.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",28432
"25790","Big and ripe, this rich wine offers a good combination of spice and tropical fruits. It is bold, smooth and creamy. Deliciously ripe, it's ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",25790
"101778","The aromas draw you into the glass, with brooding notes of purple fruit, mineral and baking spice. The cherry flavors are full in feel, showing impressive purity and depth. There's no trace of new oak in sight.","Red","Syrah","US",101778
"64329","Amidst cola and sassafras on the nose, there's a bit of rotting cherry funk and some compost pile aromas to this intriguing single-vineyard Syrah from the Los Alamos area. The little bit of cherry sweetness on the palate gets more serious with chopped herbs, tobacco and cedar.","Red","Syrah","US",64329
"5187","There's big, stewy fruit happening within the midst of this soft wine. What brings it down is the finish, slightly bitter like a sour cherry.","Red","Barbera","US",5187
"41824","This boldly structured wine opens with aromas of baked plum, clove, tobacco and graphite. The firm full-bodied palate displays dried cherry, raisin, licorice, clove and espresso alongside gripping, close-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2025.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",41824
"105002","A 100% Roussanne wine is rare in its normal origin, the Rhône Valley. Here, in the mountains, it has produced this intensely perfumed, tightly textured wine that is both unusual and delicious. Crisply textured and with spice and a dry edge, the wine could be aged for a few months. Drink from the end of 2016.","White","Roussanne","France",105002
"1062","Aromas of dried rose, violet and red berry meld together in the glass. The refined palate offers dried cherry, light toast, mineral and a hint of spice alongside soft, supple tannins.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",1062

"92268","Coming from a classic limestone vineyard, this is tense, structured and tight. It is textured, with spice and tangy acidity giving some complexity to the otherwise fruity wine. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",92268
"68602","Starts with stemmy, burnt aromas but after time oak notes cover things up. Apple, sweet pear, buttery oak and popcorn are the main flavors on this sweet, pithy wine that when stripped down is fairly hollow and simple.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",68602
"16976","A touch of flint meets yeasty, herbal notes of chervil and white pepper. The palate plays these two off each other and adds a generous dollop of pure, linear lemon zest to brighten and heighten everything. Lasting zestiness makes for an ultraclean, very refreshing finish on a very concentrated, taut body.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",16976
"11618","Once known as Nugent Vineyard, Winside is a blend of Dijon and Pommard clones that's on the more robust side, especially in this climatically perfect vintage. Offering exuberant red cherry fruit and layers of cola and milk chocolate, it's ready to enjoy with pork tenderloin and similarly hearty fare.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",11618
"47327","Floral and fresh, but there's more to it than just a simple quaff. Watermelon and berry flavors are carried by a plump, medium-bodied palate, slightly oily texture and a long, mouthwatering finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",47327

"5972","Heavily toasted oak aromas precede spicy, black fruit flavors in this full-bodied, tannic wine. It fires on all cylinders, from its intense smoky, charred aromas to its concentrated blackberry flavors to its mouth-coating, fine-grained tannins that grip the palate and help the finish linger.","Red","Malbec","US",5972
"31585","There's an attractive, fruity quality to this wine that comes off in layers of cherry fruit, blueberry, almond paste and spice. Made with the robust Montepulciano grape, this wine takes a more delicate and tender approach.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",31585
"75389","Very easy, slightly confected cherry fruit comes immediately to the fore. The palate has the same candy-ish notion countered with lots of freshness. The body is light, translucent and off dry. Drink soon while berryish aromas are at their peak.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",75389
"201","Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",201
"24302","In half-and-half proportions, Gamay and the local Loire grape Grolleau combine in this medium-sweet rosé. It is crisp, clean with red-berry fruits and balanced acidity. It is attractive and can be consumed as an apéritif.","Rosé","Rosé","France",24302
"824","Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",824
"105445","Lifted heady notes of Damask rose rise from the glass alongside lemony tang. The palate brims with the same rose petal notes but also holds plenty of spice: sandalwood and ginger, white pepper and the merest touch of vanilla. The palate is concentrated and rounded with gentle sweetness, countered by fresh lemon acidity. The persistence of flavors on the palate is incredible. Serve this either with fruity spicy Asian fare or runny, soft and very ripe cheeses.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",105445
"33688","Here's a pure, single vineyard, deeply-fruited Malbec, loaded with blackberry and cassis. It shows the varietal highlights of peppery herb, bark and earth, with well-managed tannins and good balance overall.","Red","Malbec","US",33688
"80196","Carmione is a 50-10-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot that opens with a bright bouquet of wild spice, black fruit, prune, plum and rum cake. The wine is dense and dark with a thick, almost gritty feel in the mouth. This is a bruiser that would pair with mesquite-grilled ribeye steak.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",80196
"61136","This is a simply rendered, nicely light-bodied version of the variety, round and fleshy in mouthfeel with a taste of sugar-rimmed lime.","White","Chardonnay","US",61136
"64431","The wine, a blend of 90% Merlot with 10% Cabernet Franc, is structured, showing plenty of tannins. The fruit is bright with some attractive acidity coming from the black-currant flavors. The wine needs a little time, so drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",64431
"33674","This Amarone has aromas of ripe black fruit and vanilla. The palate delivers plum and blackberry flavors layered with chocolate and oak.

The palate is driven by citrus, simple yet tasty, with fresh limes, kumquat and light guava, proving both tropical and racy.","White","Chardonnay","US",76364
"96777","Salinic and almost dilute on the nose, which belies the richer banana and vanilla flavors that control the flavor profile. In the mouth, the wine has good bounce and acidity, so it feels alright even when things turn creamy on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",96777
"7911","Earthy and recalling the aromas of a woodshed or old barn, this tastes of darker fruit. Relatively lean on the palate, it ends as abruptly as it starts.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7911
"60064","Ripe blackberry meets with rustic leather and a bit of rubbery funk on this nose of this wine made by the Riboli family of Los Angeles' San Antonio Winery. It's rich and jammy with tannins adding balance, but not much acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60064
"27627","This wine has weight and richness. It is ripe with apricot and peach flavors that are happily balanced by a crisp edge of acidity. Its texture will give it a good future. Drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",27627
"85119","This wood-aged blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon has ripe fruits and plenty of the crisp acidity typical of the vintage. Its wood touches are subtle, just enough to give a creamy texture. The wine has a rich texture and will certainly age for another few months. Drink from 2018.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",85119
"58095","Creamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees. Finishes long and classy, with elegance. Drink immediately before it loses its vitality.","White","Albariño","Spain",58095
"96961","Taut and tense, this opens with aromas of red berry, crushed herb, clove and whiff of menthol.

Drink 2019–2031.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",96961
"94672","The fruit stars in this tasty Chardonnay. Pineapples, pears, mangoes, green apples and Key lime pie dance on the palate. A touch of oak adds vanilla cream and buttered toast. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",94672
"28084","This opens with grassy, green aromas of candied raspberry. A chunky palate delivers candied, caramelized, slightly weedy red-fruit flavors. Not a lot besides acidity and heat is driving the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",28084
"12836","Black in color, this dense wine has power, concentration and a hugely tannic structure. Still in its infancy, it is darkly dominated by its dry, firm texture, the black fruits still hiding behind the framework and the acidity. Give this complex wine until 2018 before drinking.","Red","Malbec","France",12836
"9812","Warm and rounded, this is a soft, ripe rosé. The flavors of plums and red berries roll easily around the mouth, producing a wine that is full, rich and soft.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",9812
"26452","A Langhorne Creek blend put together by importer George Galey, this Cabernet shows a deft touch, combining cassis fruit with a lifted, almost raspberry-like component.

Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",26452
"1137","Light and clear in color, this wine veers into cool-climate, restrained territory in its well-defined lines of sage, dried herb and stemmy earth. Dry tannins give an oomph of power beneath traces of dried rose.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1137
"89249","Dense aromas of smoked black plum, rustic leather and smoked meats show on this super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah. Dried blueberries, fudge, beef char and very tarry elements show on the palate.","Red","Red Blend","US",89249
"95790","From architect José Perdgão's small quinta—only 17 acres on typically high-altitude merciless soil—this classic Dão blend including Alfrocheiro and Jaen is ripe, still firmly tannic and mineral. It has weight and density, extra rich from the wood aging, and packed with solid tannins and balanced black fruits and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",95790
"4610","This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.","White","Riesling","Germany",4610
"10304","As befits a vintage bubbly, this is toasty and yeasty upfront, yet remains fresh and citrusy. It's a medium-bodied sparkler that comes across as fairly dry, making it clean and refreshing on the finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","New Zealand",10304
"64833","This Cabernet Franc is beautiful, with incredible succulence, persistence, heat, power and a full plate of enticing fragrances. Coffee, root beer, chocolate, Nutella, graham cracker and cherry liqueur are only a few elements of the wine's complexity.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Italy",64833
"2463","This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.","Red","Merlot","US",2463
"10352","Ripe berry aromas approach raisiny, but settle on jammy plum and leather. This is tannic and wide, with ruggedness to the mouthfeel. Flavors of earthy berry, baked fruits and cocoa end with grab, heat and burn. This is good but rough, like a gravel road.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",10352
"21964","A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21964
"9134","This is a new wine from this negociant house that specializes in limited production wines. It is a smooth and rounded wine, ripe with apples and yellow fruits as well as being cut with acidity. The wine is refreshing and crisp at the end with a touch of minerality.","White","Chardonnay","France",9134
"73035","Wild berry, cherry and mint notes are what you'll find on this wine's open, likable bouquet. The feel is clean and crisp, with snappy wild-berry and plum flavors that crackle with finishing acidity and controlled tannins.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",73035
"57607","Gritty, green aromas are not really ripe or friendly. This is high in pyrazines and tastes peppery and largely fruitless. A sour finish with sweaty notes are as expected given the nose and flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",57607
"22102","Darkly rich, this is a smooth, sophisticated wine that packs a punch of tannin under all its opulent black fruit. From a single parcel of the La Rosa vineyard named for the intense heat there in summer, it's concentrated and dense, with a great future ahead of it. Drink from 2022.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",22102
"65226","This is so intense and fruit forward, the aromas are almost like those of Fruit Roll-Ups. Notes of strawberry, raspberry and peach abound on the nose and palate, with good acidic lift that just balances all of that fruity sweetness.","Rosé","Rosé","South Africa",65226
"31190","This is a sneak peak at Hanzell's estate Chardonnay of the vintage, yet to be released. With a bit of oak, it's dry, rich and creamy, displaying forward pineapple, Meyer lemon and lime fruit flavors for drinking now.","White","Chardonnay","US",31190
"3765","The wine is rich and ready to drink. With red fruits and warm tannins, it is a ripe wine that has a light structure and balanced acidity. It is already an easy wine—fruity and soft at the end.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",3765
"104162","Spicy aromas of green tobacco blend with plum and berry notes. This Merlot is drying and tannic on the palate. Leafy flavors are fairly green, with generic black-fruit notes keeping it afloat.","Red","Merlot","Chile",104162
"45756","There's a crazy mix of grape varieties in this blend—Syrah, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo and Grenache—but each grape brings its own unique voice to form a very complex chorus. While any of them, on its own, might be incomplete, the resulting whole is rich, full-bodied, warming and satisfying. The alcohol is admittedly high, but the wine carries it with style.","Red","Red Blend","US",45756
"83827","Oily aromas of orange peel and tropical fruits set up a creamy low-acid palate. Peach, melon and lychee flavors are light but pleasant, while this semisweet Moscato is tropical tasting but dilute on the finish.","White","Moscato","Brazil",83827
"517","Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish.","White","Riesling","France",517
"23940","This accessibly priced wine shows soy, black tea, boysenberry, black pepper, baked plums and lavender notes on the nose. The palate offers lilacs, rose petals and more lavender, alongside olallieberry, pencil lead and a peppery spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",23940
"72289","Ripe dark berry, sweet cake spice and pipe tobacco are just some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. The palate shows structure and finesse, doling out black cherry, raspberry, black pepper, clove and anise alongside firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",72289
"15519","Notes of red apple and herbal savor lead to an even fruitier, fresh palate of easy lightness. This is all about that fresh, ripe apple flavor in all its honest, fresh-faced appeal. Daringly off dry, the merest suggestion of sweetness boosts all the delicious apple notes and makes this very, very fruity. Drink soon.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",15519
"62991","Ripe bold cassis and blackberry aromas come with notes of fine oak and chocolate. This is thorough and saturated on the palate, with a mix of firm tannins and cushion. Blackened plum and berry flavors have a cola accent, while this is dry, toasty and displays tannic grip on the finish; drink through 2022.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",62991
"44616","With good density, this is a success for the vintage. It has ripe, smooth fruit, flavors of black berry, the tannins well integrated. Age for a year.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",44616
"34808","Aged in large oak casks, this gorgeous Pinot Bianco shows lively aromas of white flower, pear, Golden Delicious apple and stone fruit. It's a tight, well-compacted wine, with enormous length and elegance on the finish.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",34808
"16009","Prickly aromas of nettle and cactus include crushed vitamin scents and tropical fruit notes. This feels gritty and dilute. Tart tropical-fruit flavors of lychee, pineapple and lime finish crisp, tangy and angular.","Rosé","Rosé","Argentina",16009
"87280","From two vineyard sites and given thimblefuls of Grenache, Petite Sirah, Carignane, Malbec and Zinfandel, this wine is an ode to the winemaker's lifelong obsession with surfing, with a nod to the wildness of the California coast. Black licorice, dark plum and saddle wrap around tightly wound, powerful tannins and a pronounced minerality. Drink now through 2023.","Red","Syrah","US",87280
"73069","Undurraga's top Sauvignon hails from the premier terroir of Leyda. It smells clean and inviting, with an aromatic mix of talcum powder, lime, mango and scallion. The palate is very fresh and lively, with snappy citrus flavors that include grapefruit. Razor-clean on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",73069
"86472","Earthy aromas of violet, mature berry, sage, tilled soil and a funky note of game lead the nose. The funky note carries over to the palate along with dried plum and white pepper. Youthfully austere tannins provide the backbone.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",86472
"53839","Altero opens with a dark garnet color and tight fruit aromas of white cherry, pomegranate, cassis and dried raspberry. Supple tones of smoke, leather and tobacco fill out the rear but only play a supporting role. In the mouth, the wine is tight, streamlined and sharp.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",53839
"67185","A ripe wine reflecting the richness of the vintage, this is full of light mineral notes backed by generous white fruit. Creamed apple and plum flavors dominate, lifted by lasting crisp acidity. Drink from late 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",67185
"42721","This is an inky, black Amarone that is redolent of black fruit, plum, BBQ sauce, root beer and mesquite smoke. Pair this wine with thick beef ragout over oven-roasted pasta or game dishes. The wine is sticky and ripe in the mouth with firm tannins.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",42721
"2651","With a perfumed nose of rose and toasted oak, this wine is thick in red fruit, dense oak and a welcome undercurrent of bright acidity that helps keep it fresh in the glass. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec are all within.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",2651
"47333","Bright and tonic, with vibrant fruit tones of cassis and dried raspberry followed by exotic spice and smoked bacon, this is an elegant and complex Barolo. After a while in the glass, you'll notice those fine mineral tones that characterize the Cannubi cru and that give this wine both backbone and personality.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",47333
"63178","As one might expect from a Rhône-based producer, this is a meaty, earthy rendering of Shiraz. It's only medium bodied, but frames its black olive and spice flavors in dry, dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",63178
"57556","For an ice wine, this is relatively rich. But it certainly doesn't take away from the pure acidity that lifts the sweet fruit, giving the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors a great frame. It is ready to drink now, but another year and it will be even better focused.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",57556
"60893","Soft in structure and slightly herbal, this polished wine has flavors of blackberries, cherries, tobacco, cocoa and leather. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60893
"75068","This is a big, concentrated and lush-textured wine, bolder and thicker than many of its peers and beautifully laced with dark berry, dark chocolate and cardamom flavors.

"52258","Soft and fruity, the fruit light, flavored with plum jelly and dried fruits. The wine is soft, somewhat unfocused, the tannins giving some dryness, but leaving a feeling of old-fashioned over-ripe fruits.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",52258
"3443","Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature.","Red","Malbec","US",3443
"20127","This wine sees only 10–15% new oak, which allows the gritty peach and tangerine fruit flavors to shine through, dressed up by hints of toasted hazelnuts. White peaches and a powdered talc texture give the impression of richness without excess weight. Finishes long, with notes of mineral and citrus.","White","Chardonnay","France",20127
"49624","Tannins are what help great Italian Nebbiolo age for many years, and this Santa Barbara expression of the variety is loaded with tannins. So much so that they lock down the palate with fierce astringency. So is it an ager? There's a polished depth of cherry and leather flavor, but it may not be enough for the long haul. Call it a work in progress.","Red","Nebbiolo","US",49624
"61737","This wine puts the floral aspects of the varietal front and center. Rose petal and flower-soap aromas lead onto the palate that bears similar flavors and a hint of residual sugar. It shows nice concentration.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",61737
"5817","Grapefruit and stony aromas grace the nose in front of a lightly spritzy palate. Flavors of mixed tropical fruits show notes of bell pepper and white pepper dust, while nectarine and grapefruit flavors drive the finish.","White","Verdejo","Spain",5817
"105397","Initially faint whiffs of saffron, tangerine and blossom catapult with intensity on the palate of this auslese. It's finely framed, but flavors of preserved peach, mango and honey are dense and concentrated, and cut with a long, linear streak of lime. Gorgeous now, but sure to intensify for decades to come.","White","Riesling","Germany",105397
"63735","This wine has lots of fruit, a good dash of spicy oak, a very firm structure, and a great sense of depth and polish. It will be very tasty with a grilled steak or smoked brisket. While fun to drink now, it will improve through at least 2020.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",63735
"8192","The vineyard has championed Pinot Noir in this unlikely location in inland Mendocino County, and now De Loach successfully takes up the cause. Their '06 is gently soft, silky and dry, with deep flavors of cherries, currants, raspberries and chocolate, finished with a fine layer of oaky vanilla.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8192
"5943","Made in the popular style, this has flavors of pineapple and orange jam, buttered toast and buttered popcorn. Its acidity and firm minerality save it from seeming sweet.","White","Chardonnay","US",5943

"89550","Ripe berry fruit and gritty oak aromas lead to a full-bodied blocky palate with grating tannins. This is a heavily oaked blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and Merlot. Flavors of blackberry, vanilla and wood spice finish with barrel char and depth. Drink through 2023.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",89550
"32992","Medium bodied, this has a bitter papaya seed note that threads the pliant core of tropical fruit and toast flavors. The acids gain some momentum on the finish.","White","Verdejo","US",32992
"18696","A wondrously rich and extracted nose combines layers of brown spice, dried black cherries, fragrant violets and lilacs with concentrated, almost pruney purple fruit. That ripeness expertly pairs on the palate with strong tannic structure and sparkling acidity, allowing the blackberry, blueberry, caramel and lavender notes to shine without cloying.","Red","G-S-M","US",18696
"105417","Cherry and raspberry aromas are rubbery and show a fair amount of creamy, artificial-smelling oak. This is chewy and resiny in feel, with jammy flavors of raspberry, plastic and vanilla. Heat and oak are the prime players on a weak finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",105417
"35993","Semi-sweet and tasting like cherry-flavored cough medicine, this Merlot leaves a lot to be desired. But it's serviceable.","Red","Merlot","US",35993
"8053","This 100% Pinot Nero opens with aromas of red currant, rose petal and a whiff of graphite. The savory palate offers strawberry and red cherry alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",8053
"85489","This young Chianti Classico is still a bit closed, but it reveals cherry and raspberry sensations along with black- and white-pepper notes. It's still tightly knit but it should should open up well after one or two more years bottle aging.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",85489
"37221","Subdued hints of lily and jasmine rise from the glass. The palate offers restrained notes of peach and Mirabelle plum, with a rounded, off-dry finish focusing on blossom honey. It's a gentle, rounded and perfumed wine.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",37221
"50123","Round and ripe, this opens with aromas that recall baked plum, vanilla, anise and a whiff of leather. The approachable, juicy palate doles out mature black cherry, blackberry, mocha, dried sage, baking spice and licorice. Polished, fine-grained tannins provide support.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",50123
"12945","Compelling and sweet-smelling, Archimede offers pretty tones of spice, black cherry, molasses, espresso and cola. The ruby-colored wine is zippy and fresh with soft tannins and medium length in the mouth.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",12945
"95710","Leading with a slightly sour smell of tart apple and lime rind, the aromas from this single-vineyard Pinot Gris also pick up a wet rock minerality. Upon sipping, flavors of apple pie and peach emerge on the backdrop of a light, vibrant mouthfeel thanks to the stainless-steel processing, making this an excellent companion for fruit-topped salads or spicy food.","White","Pinot Gris","US",95710
"1220","A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noir—even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",1220
"86248","Complex, flavorful but not too big, this layered wine has aromas like cedar and tobacco, and flavors like black cherry and mint. It offers a medium-full body and velvety texture.","Red","Red Blend","US",86248
"55531","Silky and refined. It’s on the lighter side, but shows no lack of flavor and may be even prettier for its ephemeral nature. Shows cherries, tree bark and a touch of cranberries and bitter chocolate on the finish. Drink soon for its youthful charms.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55531
"63445","A good evocation of a Santa Ynez Grenache. Shows the right bite of acidity, with interesting cherry pie, bacon and sandalwood flavors that lead to a long, spicy finish. Drink up.","Red","Grenache","US",63445
"71730","This ripe Pinot is as sweetly sappy as raspberry syrup. The oak brings additional sweetness, this time of caramel and buttered toast. A little clumsy now, but might gain traction in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71730
"52129","Restrained and dusty in leathery tannin, this wine opens in the glass to unravel bold black-fruit and licorice power, offering stark succulence and moderate acidity on the palate.","Red","Zinfandel","US",52129
"12222","Superrich, offering waves of pineapple, mango, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The brilliantly crisp acidity of Edna Valley makes it all clean and brisk. Not much going on below the appealing surface, so drink now. Ahi tuna tartare comes to mind.","White","Chardonnay","US",12222
"85888","A brawny, hearty and inviting nose of macerated bramble and lush cherry are enhanced by sarsaparilla, leather and turned loam on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1922. Nutmeg and kola-nut spice enliven the brightly acidic cherry, plum and strawberry fruit. Lilacs and gravel minerality ensue as well, and it all finishes tartly on plum skins.","Red","Zinfandel","US",85888
"42056","This ripe selection conveys a superb sense of balance and refinement, with forward aromas and flavors of black cherry and brambly berry framed by notes of wood spice, mocha and pressed violet. Velvety in feel, the texture is plush and seductive, with fine yet structured tannins and ample acidity to keep the palate fresh through the close. It's certainly delicious now, but this should age well through 2022.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",42056
"1948","Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors. The wood comes through firmly producing a solid, very dry character. The more juicy black currant fruits are still to show well. So wait to drink until 2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",1948
"57949","Green olive and a weedy back note make for a green, herbal expression of the variety here. None of this is helped by the oppressive tannin structure all around the palate, a power that dissolves quickly on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",57949
"41025","Starts off with a bit of a sweaty funk that soon blows off and allows more pleasant notes of bay leaves, thyme, red currant and rhubarb to come through. A touch sanguine and mulchy in the mouth with lighter body and acidity.","Red","Red Blend","France",41025
"8151","The bouquet of this Chard is somewhat quiet and reserved at first, offering faint aromas of yellow flowers and honeysuckle alongside fruity accents of red apple and Asian pear. The palate is clean and approachable, with brisk flavors of citrus and underripe pear that lend verve through the close.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",8151
"90976","This wine includes all five traditional red-Bordeaux varieties, Merlot the most dominant, resulting in tart Bing cherry and cassis flavors. It doesn't hold back on tannin or power, showing grippy persistence on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",90976
"80817","A romantic name for an easy fruity wine. Spice from wood gives the black-currant fruit richness and some complexity. With its acidity and dry core, this is a wine to keep for another year. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",80817
"11545","Made in the modern way of very ripe fruit and lots of oak, this Chardonnay certainly delivers plenty of pineapple jam, tangerine, Meyer lemon tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Designed for the Chard crowd that likes this popular style.","White","Chardonnay","US",11545
"17164","This example shows a bit more character than many Pays d'Oc Chardonnays. Pretty scents of lemon and honeysuckle lead to a palate with above-average concentration and lovely lemon meringue pie flavors. Tangy acidity renders this a good choice for salmon.","White","Chardonnay","France",17164
"35652","Earthy, woody aromas of heavy berry fruits are tired. This has a chunky, soupy feel along with overripe flavors of raisin and roasted plum. A burnt-wood character akin to hickory controls the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",35652
"49195","Lisboa's coastal climate keeps this wine fresh and with good acidity despite its richness. Wood aging has smoothed the natural tannins of the fruit, yileding a concentrated wine with a deep, solid base that could still benefit from some aging.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",49195
"81712","Dark colored and powerful, this is a great expression of the more massive side of Gevrey Chambertin. The wine is dense, dark, with black plum and fig flavors, leavened with attractive juicy acidity. Tannins thread through the acidity. Age for 2–3 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",81712
"5985","The nose of this bottling remains tight long after opening, which suggests a decent cellar potential. A hearty swirl coaxes out thyme, bay leaf, graphite and elderberry aromas before the palate delivers salt and pepper spice and dark blackberry fruit, wrapped in solid tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",5985
"43624","Based in the Côte des Blancs, Nicolas Feuillatte has access to some fine Chardonnay for this mineral-textured wine. Lightly perfumed with white flowers, it is crisp and fresh, with sliced apple and lemon right up front. The wine is fruity now and will age well. Either drink now or wait for more maturity from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",43624
"77512","This bottling, sourced from the popular Tondre's Grapefield, is imbued with the scents and tastes of passionfruit. Fleeting spearmint and picked pear characters also arise on the nose, while apple tart flavors emerge midpalate. But passionfruit rules the day, and that's not a bad thing at all.","White","Chardonnay","US",77512
"15243","Light and refreshing in style, this wine boasts slightly confected cherry fruit amplified by bright acidity. It's straightforward and relatively simple; drink it over the next year or so.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",15243
"15531","A dense, dark-colored wine, this reveals the full power of Tannat's tannins. It also has tarry black-fruit and licorice flavors, with a foursquare chunky character. It's drinkable now, but it will be less stark in 4–5 years.","Red","Tannat","France",15531
"88373","The real deal in a cool-climate Syrah. Dark and broodingly dry, it smells like grilled lamb, roasted rosemary, white pepper and other Provençal herbs, blackberries, cassis and smoky oak. High in alcohol but balanced, this 100% varietal wine is huge, powerful, dramatic and tannic. Drink it soon with the best grilled meats.","Red","Syrah","US",88373
"24418","This shows distinctive dryness and tannins, with an elegant mouthfeel framing black currant and oak flavors. But it's a little shy of being ageworthy, so drink up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",24418
"105200","Subtle yet decadent aromas of wild berry cobbler, dried flower, chocolate and smoked meat comprise the nose of this Bordeaux-style red blend. Medium to full bodied, this bears firm yet finessed tannins and composed acids. Added notes of leather and spice unfold on the lingering finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",105200
"27764","Plum, spice and sweet herb aromas lead to rounded blue-fruit flavors surrounded by dry, astringent tannins that are unyielding.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",27764
"37297","Very beautiful red wine. Not too many Cab Francs are coming off this mountain. It's lighter in body, and more cherried, than your standard Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, but shows the same tough tannins. Yet it's not an ager. Drink now–2010, with steak or lamb, and decant.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",37297
"70448","Taut and textured, yet ripe and soft, this has a nectarine flavor that's balanced by a note of fresh lime. The finish is easy, nervy and zingy.","White","Chardonnay","France",70448
"103313","Much in the style of Leonetti Cabernet, with the richness of Napa Valley fruit, this deeply satisfying, superripe wine is 100% varietal. Notes of cassis, fig and a hint of prune are swathed in deeper flavors of espresso and dark chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103313
"4275","Full of tropical fruits, this ripe, textured wine is rich in aromas and depth. Abundant peach and apricot flavors give immediate pleasure and attractiveness. Drink this opulent wine now.","White","Chardonnay","France",4275
"59617","Baked earth, pressed rose, coffee, cocoa and plum aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. The round, hearty palate doles out mature black cherry, juicy blackberry, licorice and baking spice alongside velvety tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close. Drink sooner rather than later to capture freshness and fruit richness.","Red","Barbera","Italy",59617
"37832","Earthy, rooty aromas of cola, tobacco and baked black plum give way to a drawing, drying palate with rubbery, clampy tannins. Roasted plum, prune and herbal flavors finish loamy in feel but salty in flavor.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",37832
"96443","This wine offers notes of peach, honeysuckle and lime leaf. It's sweet and lightly spritzy in feel, with lavender flavors on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",96443
"59348","The challenge for the winemaker in future vintages is to tame these hard, fierce tannins. With sour cherry candy and sandalwood flavors and tart acidity, this '11 is rustic-chic. Enjoy with an upscale hamburger.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",59348
"66455","Ripe and pure, with good heft, body, structure and length. The blend is 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha, and while the early aromas are tough and rubbery they soon morph into plum and berry. Raspberry and full plum flavors are thick but balanced as spice and pepper close things out.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",66455
"50626","Brightly perfumed wine, its acidity coming from a delicious array of white fruits, citrus and green plums. It has some sweetness, making it a fine apéritif style.","White","Riesling","France",50626
"33516","There is something a little funky about this wine. At first, it has a creamy quality that mixes well with the peach and apricot flavors and gives the wine a certain complexity, but over time, that edge becomes a little dank, and begins to overwhelm the fruit.","White","Moscato","Italy",33516
"103364","Peach, citrus and other simple but pure aromas give this Verdejo a proper if somewhat rote opening. The palate is tangy and cleansing, with lemon and apple in the lead. Finishes a bit acidic, but with freshness and a clean get-away. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.","White","Verdejo","Spain",103364
"15686","Spicy, peppery aromas yield to tomato but not much fruit. The palate is sour, with tart plum and cherry. And the finish is equally lean and tart. High acids and not much fruit equals a lower-end wine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","France",15686
"6561","Tight in oak barrel and tar-licked tannin, this red is a tad on the hollow side midpalate, but shows promise in its cinnamon spice and blackberry fruit flavor. It finishes lean.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",6561
"51025","Leaving its primo estate in the Russian River, the producer travels to a similarly minded site in the heart of the Valley of the Moon, planted partially to mixed blacks. Here, 12% mixed blacks make up the whole, offering a bright and juicy explosion of brambly blackberry, smoked cherry and leathery licorice. The finish is soft and spicy.","Red","Zinfandel","US",51025
"85082","A 100% varietal wine, this offers tremendous quality for the price, a well-crafted showcase for currant, cedar and bark that remains savory at its core. Grippy in tannin and contained oak, it's drinkable now but will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2021.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85082
"78857","From 30-year-old vines, this lively and thoroughly delightful wine pushes a swath of honey down the core. It's smooth and supple, with bright candied-citrus flavors. You'll find a lick of butterscotch also, as the wine has terrific penetration and length. It's perfect for solo sipping, slightly chilled.","White","Riesling","US",78857
"103686","Violet, ripe plum, black-skinned berry, leather and truffle scents take center stage in this firmly structured red. The medium-bodied palate offers dried plum, chopped herb and licorice flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins and racy acidity, finishing on a black tea note. It's still a bit austere but should develop beautifully over the next few years. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",103686
"16755","Exuberant aromas of cocoa and raspberry with light herb accents are followed by fresh, forward fruit flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins that bring some astringency.","Red","Merlot","US",16755
"70558","The spicy, warm nose on this mellow red is an apt start to a really good wine. Flavors of clove, cinnamon and spice mingle with red berry and a slight tingle on the tongue and finish. An intriguing sip that will pair well with dishes of like warming spice: think Moroccan, Turkish.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",70558
"3757","Soft, dull and vegetal. Still, it's drinkable for some modest cola flavors and velvety mouthfeel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3757
"67800","The nose promises clear citrus, the palate delivers wonderfully pure and linear lemon flavors, bursting with richer mandarin and firm-fleshed tangerine notes that crunch as you bite into them: this is how fresh, zesty and utterly appetizing this Riesling is. Dangerously delicious and oh so long.","White","Riesling","Austria",67800
"15641","This is a full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay that manages to avoid the sensation of excess weight. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by understated toasted nuttiness, while a long line of acid prolongs the harmonious finish. Drink now–2018.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",15641
"6584","Spicy and briary, almost like Zinfandel, which gives this Merlot a somewhat rustic feel. But it's rich in raspberries, cherries, currants and toast. Drink it now.","Red","Merlot","US",6584
"47454","A simple, fruit-forward rosé ideal for summer sipping, this blend of Syrah and Grenache boasts attractive mixed berry, melon and citrus aromas, with flavors that finish clean and dry.","Rosé","Rosé","France",47454
"88184","An easy-drinking Côtes du Rhône, this isn't particularly intense but is harmonious from start to finish. Hints of garrigue accent black cherry and plum fruit, while the texture is silky.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",88184
"40462","Fragrant with pretty berry scents, this compact wine rewards some hours of breathing time. The tangy fruit is complemented by streaks of herb, mineral and citrus peel, all woven together into a gently fading finish that adds a lick of dark chocolate.","Red","Syrah","US",40462
"100573","A blend of 45% Cannonau, 45% Carignano and 10% Bovale Sardo, this opens with aromas of cassis, red cherry and Mediterranean scrub. The round juicy palate offers black plum, ripe raspberry and white pepper set against pliant tannins. Enjoy through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",100573
"15415","Multi-dimensional and inviting, the nose offers a melange of cherry, spice, earth and gamy notes. A very supple mouthfeel follows with wonderfully firm, but not biting, acidity. Dark cherry and oak flavors hang on a handsome frame. Closes with a long, spicy finish with beautifully integrated tannins. Has great character; a most impressive example of the vintage and the Knight’s Gambit and Red Hills Estate Vineyards.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15415
"40222","Muskmelon and lime flavors start off tasting sweet, but are quickly reined in by brisk acidity, finishing chalky and tart. This is a fine Riesling, yet slightly disappointing in the context of previous vintages.","White","Riesling","New Zealand",40222
"104673","This opens with aromas of coconut, tilled soil, stewed plum and mocha. The dense palate delivers blackberry jam, dried black cherry, espresso and a confectionery note alongside the heat of scorching alcohol and velvety tannins. It's already rather evolved and accessible. Drink through 2020.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",104673
"57495","Wild bilberries abound on nose and palate and scent the entire drinking experience. The palate is fresh and vivid, as befits the slender red vintage of 2014. This has been handled with great care and turned out into a wine of elegance with poised, pure fruit and gentle structure.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",57495
"60346","Pinot gris as it should be — ripe and full-bodied, with expressive flavors of fresh pears, spiced with cinnamon. Rich and satisfying, yet tangy enough to accompany even delicate seafood. This is a home run, with just enough of a hint of barrel to give it a finishing kiss of butterscotch.","White","Pinot Gris","US",60346
"38406","Hazy aromatics of sautéed apple and baking spice mark the nose, with notes of toasted nut and dill that surface on the palate. It feels full, round and supple, gaining some lift toward the close.","White","White Blend","US",38406
"38878","The aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb and plum are reticent on first pour. On the palate, sweet fruit flavors are supported by lightly grainy tannins. It's straight down the fairway.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",38878
"86285","Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this opens with subdued aromas suggesting red plum and baking spice. The aromas carry on to the straightforward palate, together with a hint of hazelnut. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and round tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",86285
"103707","This is a 100% varietal, vineyard-designated wine, impressive in its ability to provide lush richness within a balanced context. Dark and thick, it opens with blackberry, mocha and spicy clove flavors. Although syrupy, it maintains freshness on the palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103707
"94860","Estate-grown, two-thirds Merlot and one-third Cabernet Franc, it's another wine from the Naramata Bench. It is almost impenetrable when first poured, inky and dense. Over a period of hours the tart and spicy red fruits emerge, along with the herbal, soy, smoke and olive flavors that often characterize Okanagan Bordeaux blends.","Red","Red Blend","Canada",94860
"87809","Aged in barrel for close to two years, this 100% varietal wine from a classic Napa Valley producer delivers a compelling mix of blackberry pie and chocolate. The flavors form around soft, silky, well-integrated oak and fine-grained tannins. Rich and robust, it discloses an elegance that suggests further cellaring, through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87809
"25248","Dark in color, this powerful and concentrated wine is still very young. There is possibly too much extraction here that shows in bitterness, but the wine also has the potential for aging with its rich underlying fruitiness. Don't drink before 2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","France",25248
"4343","Intensely rich, this wine is packed with flavors of spice, gingerbread and lychees. It has a full, rounded character with an intense spiciness that is anchored to a more structured texture. Drink now and until 2018.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",4343
"6913","Whiffs of balsamic vinegar and dusty minerals lend a savory, rustic tone to ripe black cherry and berry flavors in this full-bodied Syrah. The palate is concentrated, but it's a bit sharp and unrefined. The finish is modest.","Red","Syrah","US",6913
"35028","This is a delicious, ripe wine that is packed with apricot, apple and pear fruits. It is tangy and freshly fruity. The bright, rich fruit continues right through this wine that is ready to drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",35028
"10073","This big boy greets us with his deep ruby/black cloak. Loaded with cassis from start to finish, there is tremendous fruit depth here and a full, supple mouthfeel. Reminiscent of one of the successful large-scale ‘97 California Cabernets. Has tannins to resolve, best held for a year or two.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",10073
"11782","Ripe berry aromas show a note of prune as well as mocha and vanilla scents. Tight clampy tannins roughen up the mouthfeel on this Maule Cabernet, while a fairly heavy wood element blends with flavors of herbal berry fruits and beef jerky. This is a full-volume wine with a full-volume finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",11782
"76576","One of the producer's lighter-styled wines, delicately delicious, this shows forest floor, orange and lemon in a brightly crisp, high-toned package of polish and grace. A touch of rhubarb--strawberry compote lurks on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76576
"66754","This wine from northern Italy offers bell pepper and red currant aromas that carry over to the palate along with notes of black pepper. The bright, straightforward and easy-drinking style is ideal to pair with everyday fare.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Italy",66754
"68080","A tasty, easy-drinking Bordeaux blend assembled from three very different regions, the Santa Cruz Mountains, Sierra Foothills and Lodi. Very flavorful, almost exotic with cassis, cherry, chocolate, and ripe breadfruit and guava, framed in quite a bit of smoky oak. The tannins are soft. This is a wine that everyone will like.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",68080
"88889","Leather, smoked meat, crushed rock, stewed black cherry and dried oregano notes show on the rustic nose of this bottling from the team at Cru Wine Company. It's light bodied, making for easy quaffing, with red plum, beef jerky and baking spice flavors.","Red","Tempranillo","US",88889
"54505","Barrel aromas are up front on this wine, with notes of char, smoke and coffee bean ahead of herb and cherry. On the palate, the barrel influence also seems to overwhelm the fruit, which doesn't quite have the strength to stand up. Additional time in the bottle might bring it around.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",54505
"90855","There's a seemingly sweet edge to the lemon, lime and vanilla flavors, which are fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Fans of richly styled white wines will like this bottling.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",90855
"66357","Soft and fruity, with a balanced mix of tropical fruit flavors—banana and pineapple—and juicy caramel, this appealing Chardonnay is drinking perfectly. There is just enough green apple tang to the finish to keep it fresh and focused through the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",66357
"60077","Redolent of ripe red berries and cherry blossoms, this semisweet Moscato has a delicate, sugar-laced quality, balanced by bright citrus and apple flavors. Crisp in acidity, it's easy drinking and refreshing on the finish.","White","Moscato","Romania",60077

"26610","The renaissance of Kirwan, with the consultancy of Michel Rolland, continues with this ripe, forward, concentrated wine. The tannins are sweet and soft, with a solid, chunky structure that promises a long life. The finish displays balanced new wood flavors and a smooth polish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26610
"71465","A rugged wine, with harsh tannins and a green, unripe taste to the cherry-berry flavors.","Red","Red Blend","US",71465
"39703","This blend of 90% Sauvignon Blanc with some Sauvignon Gris and Musque grapes does its best to achieve ripeness, but it's dominated by green flavors of gooseberries, along with a hint of ammonia. Dry and a bit vegetal in style, this barrel-aged wine finishes on a tart note.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",39703
"86132","A touch of sweet spice jazzes up the nose, giving lift to the lightly baked apple and yellow peach characteristics. The round, medium-bodied palate has lively acidity and a sweet orange-oil flavored finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",86132
"44289","The nose is muted somewhat and the wine grippy yet a tad thin, its flavors a mix of licorice and dust.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",44289
"27794","From a famous vineyard, this is an interesting, even eccentric Zin. The aromas are claret-like, with currant and blackberry and a strong gamy note, like bacon. The fruit is very ripe, even overripe, and the tannins and acidity are ample. Fans of big, old-style Zins will love it.","Red","Zinfandel","US",27794
"39733","Gritty, stalky aromas override the wine's plum and berry scents. This feels acidic and rough, with abrasive tannins. Thus the flavors are tight, juicy and narrow, with an emphasis on red fruits. Minerality and acidity drive the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",39733
"520","The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",520
"1069","Aromas suggest red berry and plum with a hint of cake spice. The palate is elegant and reserved, offering sour cherry, toast and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. It closes on a light mineral note.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",1069
"50722","This wine from Francisco Gillmore is earthy and full of tomato and leather aromas. The palate is also a bit like tomato and herbs. The finish is tangy, courtesy of healthy acids, while the finish is tannic and a touch hot.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",50722
"13335","Oak, roasted coffee bean and rubber aromas lead the nose. The palate displays oak extract, vanilla, espresso, mocha and mature plum alongside astringent wood tannins that leave a drying finish. It lacks fruit richness.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",13335
"44158","Raspy berry and plum aromas lead to a palate dominated by tartaric acid. That, in turn, leads to sharp berry and plum flavors backed by a bracing finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",44158
"3494","Fleshy black plums and berries burst from nose to palate of this juicy lip-smacking Long Island Shiraz. It's approachably plush and round with a pleasantly clingy mouthfeel. A backdrop of sweet spice and fine, feather-tipped tannins extend the finish.","Red","Shiraz","US",3494
"45289","A heavy, oaky wine. Still, it will appeal to many for its buttered toast, buttered popcorn, tropical fruit, apricot and creamy flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",45289
"85649","This is the top wine from the Jean-Pierre Fayard family Provence cru classé estate. It is full of ripe red fruits supported by a mineral texture. The wine is generous, bone dry but packed with great fruitiness and finished with refreshing acidity. This sophisticated wine could do with a few more months, so drink from late 2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",85649
"73055","A very dry, somewhat herbal Merlot, with a brittle, tannic mouthfeel. It has flavors of black cherries, currants and sage. Feels elegant and sophisticated in the mouth, a wine to drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",73055
"44666","Lots of tough, old-fashioned tannins on this pugnacious young Cabernet. While it has a good core of blackberries and currants, it's pretty brutal on the palate. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the astringency. Try after 2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44666
"59412","A revitalizing crush of lemon and limes, this spry kabinett seems sweetened by a sprinkling of sugar-cookie crumbs. Racy acidity lends spine-tingling refreshment that finishes with a lingering herbal tone. Drink now through 2019.","White","Riesling","Germany",59412
"2898","Dark berry, herb and blue-fruit aromas lead to silky fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slightly sticky feel to the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",2898
"97399","Honey, lemon and spice open this slightly blowsy Pinot Gris. The unctuous palate shows intense notes of orange peel and clove. Slightly astringent finish.","White","Pinot Gris","France",97399
"21406","The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",21406
"50100","Raspberry, cherry and cola flavors are touched with oak and highighted by zesty acidity in this lovely Pinot Noir. It doesn't have the stuffing for aging, but drinks well now with a variety of fare.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50100
"67407","This is an easy blush wine, dryish and tart in acidity, with a light, silky texture. Made from 100% Grenache, it shows pleasant orange, pink grapefruit and honey flavors.","Rosé","Rosé","US",67407
"13993","The combination of acidity, dark fruits and a minerality give this wine both great density and a fine potential. It is firm, showing the terroir of the Douro well in its grainy texture while also bringing acidity into play. It is young, concentrated and needs to age. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",13993
"74960","A very pale flamingo-pink rosé, this is moderately confected in style, but vibrant and fresh. Cotton candy notes are balanced by peachy fruit and some floral elements, while the finish is mouthwatering. Drink up.","Rosé","Rosé","France",74960
"75494","Smells a little funky, with a meaty, raw beef aroma on top of scents of green apples. Tastes thin and watery, with a suggested of appley citrus fruit flavor. The finish turns tart and dry.","White","Chardonnay","US",75494
"26162","White flowers and a red apple candy reveal themselves on the nose, but the strongest aromas convey a concentrated pear-peach perfume. The palate is dominated by apple at first, but grapefruit carries the midpalate and finish, which shows good acidity and a bit of grip as well.","White","Viognier","US",26162
"98540","Easygoing and not particularly intense, this fresh Chianti from the hills around Siena offers good integrity of cherry, blueberry and red currant flavors. The short finish is highlighted by a sprinkle of spice and cinnamon.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",98540
"68566","Light fruit, dwelling on bitter cherry and fresh raspberry flavors. The wine shows crisp acidity, tight tannins and a cool feel.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",68566
"61852","This powerful, tarry and ripe wine offers weight as well as good black fruits. As it develops, it will reveal ripe berry flavors with a balanced structure. Drink this potentially impressive wine from 2021.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",61852
"37919","Dark violet in the glass, this wine has aromas of blackberry and smoked meat. Hefty but not overpowering tannins create a backdrop for flavors of black plum, cassis, toffee, juniper and chocolate covered coffee bean. Fruit flavors and a plush mouthfeel power through the smooth toffee-laced finish.","Red","Syrah","Israel",37919
"42607","Full, with lots of structure, this offers concentrated grape and blackberry aromas that open to black-currant and cedar-spice flavors. A fine fruit-acid balance on the full, even palate keeps it lively, even in its fairly youthful and closed state. Dusty tannins and sweet-and-sour black fruits on the long but tight finish close this appealing package.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",42607
"42851","A full, fruity Zinfandel, with dusty tannins and structure. Its lingering finish is laced with notes of chocolate and vanilla. With 7% Petite Sirah mixed in, this would pair nicely with barbecue and other meaty dishes.","Red","Zinfandel","US",42851
"64652","This late-harvest wine has hints of honeyed botrytis as well as apricot fruitiness, though it is far from cloyingly sweet. The texture is soft and mature, with good integration of the fruit and the botrytis character. Try it now with cheese or foie gras.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",64652
"2239","Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2239
"21300","This is pure Syrah from a winemaker who makes a number of single-vineyard and blended Syrahs. This dark, sappy, seductive wine has you from the first sniff. Though the fruit is big and briary, winemaker Holly Turner manages to capture the polish and elegance of Washington Syrah in the way the flavors are sculpted together. Veins of tar, chocolate, smoke, black licorice, pepper and tobacco accent the young, tight fruit flavors. This wine definitely needs breathing time to show its stuff.","Red","Syrah","US",21300
"54038","This structured wine comes from one of the lesser-known Grand Crus of Vosne-Romanée. But it does have the structure and density of the wines from this run of grand crus, with bold tannins over the red-cherry fruits. It is likely to be a structured wine for many years. Drink from 2027.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",54038
"45878","This wine is made from 57% Petit Verdot (a variety of increasing interest, it seems) from mountain sites. An additional 29% Cabernet Franc and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon help soften its tastes of black licorice, leather and black currant, dotted by a dash of black olive. Opaque in color, it's savory and sizable in body without becoming overly concentrated. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",45878
"89316","Light and fresh, this is a crisp and tangy wine. Attractive acidity dominates and gives life to the bright red fruits. A slice of lemon brings a tangy dimension to this juicy, fragrant wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",89316
"63339","On the nose, this exotic white offers banana, lemon and vanilla aromas. On the palate, it has a lush pineapple and banana character edged by vanilla toast. Pretty and approachable, this is a very good go-to white for varied wine lovers.","White","White Blend","Greece",63339
"64373","Jammy blue fruit and cherries immerse themselves within a context of inviting and densely packed earth in this coastal, estate-grown wine. Spicy acidity and pronounced wood add additional weight and complexity as the texture takes on velvety lushness that's fully balanced and considerate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64373
"20214","Produced from the Clos Mireille, within sight of the Mediterranean, this fresh-faced wine shows peach and citrus flavors rounded by ripeness, although with an attractive tangy aftertaste.","White","White Blend","France",20214
"96643","All the parts are here, but they're not yet in complete harmony. The black-currant flavor is strong and deep; the tannins are thick and dramatic; and the acidity is fresh and stimulating. Oak is evident, with notes of buttered cinnamon toast, and the finish is long and spicy. All indications are of a wine that needs serious time in the cellar. Give it until at least 2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96643
"65585","The wine has all the classic structure and mineral tension of Dão. It gives both richness and dark, dry tannins that need several years to soften. At the same time, juicy black currant fruits give a fresh side to this complex, concentrated wine. Drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",65585
"25231","The dominant dark-cherry aroma smells bitter and high pitched. The palate feels supple and medium bodied, and it tastes a touch confected, like blackberry jelly used to fill donuts.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25231
"76837","In the Chatter Creek style, this is solid, well-made and varietal. Tart fruit flavors of boysenberry and pomegranate are set against firm tannins. Green tea, herb and peppery bark flavors take over the finish. The wine persists nicely in the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",76837
"77395","This plushly textured and luxuriously ripe wine has soothing baking spice aromas, soft plum and blackberry syrup flavors and a medium body. Moderate tannins boosted by 11% Petite Sirah are well integrated and make for a velvety mouthfeel.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77395
"81844","Rubbery, earthy aromas of berry fruits, plum and mushroom are solid but nondescript. This feels grabby and pinchy, with herbal, leafy, salty flavors that end with loamy plum and prune notes. Overall, this is big and forceful. Drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",81844
"95903","This Merlot holds estate fruit as well as sourced grapes from several sites, creating a well-blended wine with tiny percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Aged in both French and American oak, the wine is balanced in cranberry and blackberry, with an herbaceous underbelly.","Red","Merlot","US",95903
"77392","The fifth generation certainly got it right. This wine is more savory than fruity, as earth and oak flavors highlight the aromas while baking spices and almond flavors soothe the palate. It's smooth and lush in texture and not too heavy in body. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",77392
"102123","The nose is full of dust, cotton candy, peach pit and banana, while the palate is sugary and tastes like honeydew melon and pear. Fleshy and bland on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",102123
"60777","Fresh, fragrant orange peels and rose petal notes perfume this dry-style Riesling. The palate has a ripe yet slightly muted tone of marmalade and dried citrus-peel. Racy, lemon-edged acidity brightens the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",60777
"104911","Honey, orange blossom and a little mustard make up the nose of this classic Loire Valley SB. Tangerine and bitter greens play a duet on the palate, and the finish is more or less a reduced version of those primary flavors. The overall impression is one of a simple, tight, easy-to-drink wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",104911
"39591","Alain and Céline Vidal's second brand (they also own Château Dubraud) is a fruity blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Cabernet Franc (15%) although the smoky wood flavors also have an important place. Red berries and black currants partner with acidity and firm tannins. The wine is still developing so drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",39591
"25668","Luminous peach and tangerine flavors take center stage in this gorgeously composed sweet Riesling. Lip-smacking honey and candied orange peel flavors are offset by a dazzling streak of citrusy acidity. Despite all the sweetness, the finish is pristinely mineral. It's stunning already but should only improve through 2050.","White","Riesling","Germany",25668
"31467","There is the merest hint of chamomile lift on the nose, pulling all the other flavors heavenwards with it. There is apple as well as lemon zest. The palate is wonderfully pure and totally dry. Here and there more herbal inflections show and more mellow hints of baked apple. This is dry, taut and aromatic, but also clean-cut and precise. Lovely now but with definite aging potential. Drink now through 2030.","White","Riesling","France",31467
"16456","This spicy white blend mixes Viognier, Sémillon and Pinot Gris. Notes of green berries and other green fruits—notably banana—all have an herbal underpinning.","White","White Blend","US",16456
"45070","The nose is all black fruit and some cinnamon spice. Next up is a palate of cassis, plum and cherry, while the finish is round and buttery. Taken as a whole the wine is fairly focused, with an easygoing character and nothing too out of whack.","Red","Merlot","Chile",45070
"101607","Partly wood aged, this wine is conceived as the essence of Malbec. With its concentrated black fruits and firm tannins, it is dense and needs to age. There is a core that is firmly structured—rich and still surrounded by youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019.","Red","Malbec","France",101607
"22642","While soft on the nose with a generous dose of cooked black fruit, Jamesport's Bloc E is surprisingly crisp and lean on the palate. Pristine red fruit shines amidst layers of mocha, spice and forest floor, finishing on a grippy, darkly toasted wood note.","Red","Merlot","US",22642
"22639","Too strong and extracted in blackberry and cherry fruit, almost like pure jam, a sweet, candied impression that the caramel of new oak compounds. Feels like the winemaker tried too hard to make it flashy. Pretty good, but could use restraint and finesse.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22639
"94718","On the herbal-vegetal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, but manages to balance those elements with red pepper and nectarine flavors in a plump, easygoing style. Served with a cold vegetable terrine, this would be very stylish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",94718
"101455","This is a largely extracted, puckering wine, rich and full-flavored in blackberry and vanilla. The tannins make it difficult to discern beyond its density and grip. A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, it also employs Malbec, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101455
"7707","Brambly cassis and raspberry aromas are warm and a touch cooked. This is bullish, heavy and grabby in feel, with big tannins. Blackberry, cassis, herb and chocolate flavors finish ripe and dark. Drink through 2017.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",7707
"37798","A bit coarse in the mouth, with a sandpapery tartness through the finish. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry and well-flavored, with black cherries, currants, spicy teriyaki beef and cedar. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",37798
"10860","This dark-purple Cab is full of berry, horse hide and cola aromas. It's full bodied and chunky, with herbal, mossy flavors of buttery oak, salty berry and earth. A salinic, briny flavor lingers on the beefy finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",10860
"79903","Structured but straightforward, it opens with a pretty fragrance of white flowers, yellow apples and a whiff of bread crust, all of which carry over to the ripe, round palate.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",79903
"29710","A big, fruity wine that starts richly and then becomes drier, more tannic and firmer. The fruit is all black, full of berries and fresh acidity. Finely balanced, with an herbal character to finish it off.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",29710
"87414","Whole-cluster pressed, with 20% Marsanne in the blend, this displays fresh fruit flavors of apple and pear, with a bit of somewhat dilute green banana. There's a slightly waxy aspect to the mouthfeel; overall this is a simple, pleasant, clean but generic white wine.","White","Roussanne","US",87414
"84094","Oak-driven aromas convey toast, wood shop, vanilla and a whiff of underbrush. The rich palate delivers cherries marinated in spirits, toasted oak, espresso, pipe tobacco, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside bracing wood tannins. A licorice note marks the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",84094
"90549","The wine is simply crisp red-berry fruit. It has red-currant and wild-strawberry flavors along with intense bright acidity. It's an attractive Pinot Noir, ready to drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",90549
"94943","Not a bad price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this interest. You'll find a burst of pine-apple, lemongrass, fig and vanilla honey flavors, with the dryness and scoury acidity you want in this variety. Partial barrel fermentation adds a creamy richness to this polished wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",94943
"38526","This Ducourt wine is tight, with considerable acidity that masks the fruit. Let it calm down for a few months when those red fruits can assert themselves. Drink from late 2017 (think Thanksgiving).","Rosé","Rosé","France",38526
"54051","An oil-like shade of yellow in the glass, this is still a baby, showing aromas of walnut, seared lemon, yogurt, white flowers, oak and smoke. The acidity is pure and strong, cutting through the nutty flavors and savory richness. Sea salt, browned butter, Meyer lemon peels and orange marmalade flavors will only grow more cohesive with time.","White","Chardonnay","US",54051
"9650","Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache, this robust, tannic blend has sweet-tasting jam and cola flavors, plus a note of peppery spice. It's a little hot due to the high alcohol, and it has a touch of green vegetable on the midpalate. Drink up.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",9650
"71015","It's still very early in the life of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 15% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, so it's likely that it will improve with time. Currently, aromas of dried oregano, cedar, black plum, and violet drop into a palate where dill, marjoram and black pepper rise against a ripe blackberry base.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",71015
"58098","A fine Chardonnay for the price. Soft and buttery upon entry, it shows good balance in the midpalate, with the butter blended with fresh apple and lime, and set against enough juicy acidity to give it definition.","White","Chardonnay","US",58098
"80230","Pretty complex for an unoaked Chardonnay, with hints of anise, cinnamon and yogurt accenting apple and citrus flavors. It's plump in the mouth, and easy to drink.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",80230
"308","This lovely Chardonnay has just the right blend of juicy peaches and subtle herbs and flowers to make it easy to drink, yet interesting enough to hold your attention. Finishes long and mouthwatering.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",308
"61251","Hot in alcohol, dry and thin in fruit, this Zin shows very modest blackberry, cherry and spice flavors. Finishes with a scour of sticky tannins.","Red","Zinfandel","US",61251
"60328","Grown on chalk soil, this has a steely core that cuts through the more rounded, ripe tropical fruits. It's full and rich, balancing acidity and the full fruits. The aftertaste combines toast and freshness.","White","Chardonnay","France",60328
"31662","Made with very old, ungrafted vines, this intense wine opens with aromas of toast, leather, espresso, ripe blackberry, spice and tobacco. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry, dried plum, clove, leather and licorice alongside solid tannins and the warmth of alcohol.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",31662
"85703","All coming from Stillwater Creek, this aromatic wine offers vibrant aromas of purple fruit along with herb, whiffs of smoked meat and violets. The palate is tart, bright and fresh, with lively acidity and good depth of flavor.","Red","Syrah","US",85703
"81849","This firm red offers aromas of underbrush, French oak, exotic spice, dried rose and a balsamic whiff of menthol. On the full-bodied palate, a bracing tannic backbone supports dried black cherry, coconut, licorice, roasted coffee bean and oak-driven spice. Drink 2019–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",81849
"2749","Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.","Rosé","Rosé","US",2749
"92323","This is a softly appealing yet ultimately simple wine. It's flamboyant in flavor, suggested buttered white toast, spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with cinnamon. Ready now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92323
"16354","This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.","White","Chardonnay","US",16354
"86395","Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",86395
"40478","The addition of 5% Merlot softens this wine, a lovely representation of the wild mountain appellation from a vineyard 2,000-feet up. Juicy and layered, the wine shows restraint and elegance amidst a woodsy forest component of lean, tart fruit and cocoa powder.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",40478
"54584","Dry and tannic, this Pinot is heavy. It has strong flavors of blackstrap molasses, tea, black cherry jam and oak, and is ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54584
"102643","Babcock's Fathom seriously needs heat to ripen, and 2006 just didn't offer enough warmth. As a result, this Merlot and Petit Verdot blend has a stubbornly green, minty streak. It's very dry, with some good chocolate-  covered cherry candy flavors, but that tartness detracts.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",102643
"66405","Aromas suggest green apple and melon. This wine drinks dry with a lightly spritzy feel but the flavor concentration seems lacking.","White","Pinot Gris","US",66405
"54994","Cantaloupe and spice aromas are followed by light tart fruit flavors that linger. The flavors are quite elegant but it shows a lovely sense of balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",54994
"37094","Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subdued aromas suggesting espresso and toast. The palate is rather lean in terms of fruit richness, offering red currant, clove and a hint of vanilla alongside close-grained tannins that lead to a mouth-puckering close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",37094
"36515","A full 13-years-old, the aromas are all tertiary, bringing notes of mushroom, leather and dried cherry. The cranberry and cherry flavors are still holding on the palate, showing a delightful sense of balance. It's in a sweet spot. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",36515
"83206","Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",83206
"4007","Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Mammolo, this shows aromas of black cherry, grilled herb and a whiff of orange peel. The soft, easygoing palate offers red plum and a hint of clove alongside rounded tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",4007
"29226","In honor of Adam Comartin's daughter, who's named after the Australian city where he learned a bit of winemaking, this bubblegum pink wine offers plush and inviting aromas of light strawberry, peach skins and watermelon juice. Rounded pink and red fruits show on the palate, cut by orange zest, packed up with edgy acid and grippy tension. Quite complex.","Rosé","Rosé","US",29226
"25488","Violet, dark-skinned berry, toasted oak and sweet baking spice aromas float out of the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out mature blackberry, black currant, sage, green pepper and oak-driven spice framed in fine-grained tannins.","Red","Barbera","Italy",25488
"90881","From the western edge of Sonoma Valley, this robust, full-figured wine took on considerable power in this vintage. It exhibits elusive fruit before peeling back bittersweet layers of cranberry, orange peel and tea. After fresh rose on the nose, it adds an element of char to the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90881
"66571","A slight skunky, entirely pleasant aroma of damp herbs hits the nose first on this bottling by South African vintner Ernst Storm, then a slick rush of lemon-lime peels, ripe kiwi and green apple blossoms washes in. Flavors are driven by grapefruit and pomelo, with a wet-cement minerality.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",66571
"28871","Soft and round, this 80% Cabernet Sauvignon also has 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc and was given 16 months of oak aging. Flavors lean toward red berry and cedar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",28871
"31150","A very nice wine that's zesty and fresh in the mouth, and deep gold in color, the Vat 47 offers bright yellow fruit flavors, with light vanilla, toast and citrus accents. Nose is alternately perfumey and toasty. Tasted twice.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",31150
"54984","Fig, black plum, dried cherry and chai spice show on the nose of this bottling from River Road south of Salinas. Heavy flavors of dried black cherry and dried cranberry show on the sip, lifted by eucalyptus oil, juniper and black-tea elements.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54984
"86516","Bright aromas of pear, peach, baking spice and malolactic notes lead to a sleek yet creamy palate. It loses its rhythm a touch in the middle but comes back together.","White","Chardonnay","US",86516
"16148","Shows the earthiness that often marks young Calera Pinot, which makes it less flashy but more elegant and food-friendly than many more expensive wines. The herb-infused cherry, raspberry and cola flavors are ripe and succulent, but acidity is a little deficient, so this may not be the most ageable wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",16148
"10418","This big, spicy wine is dominated by licorice and heavy toast wood flavors. It is rich and full of black plum skins with only a hint of acidity. The aftertaste is sharp and bitter.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",10418
"86230","Merlot (63%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Malbec. Brooding aromas of herb, pencil lead, vanilla and spice are followed by dry dark-fruit flavors. The midpalate seems lacking, and the tannins show a touch of astringency.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",86230
"6574","Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet. A bit sticky and it falls off on the finish, but overall it's a nice value red.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",6574
"18206","Aromas of violet, iris, ripe black-skinned fruit, dried grape and a whiff of tobacco lead the way on this full-bodied charmer. The smooth, structured palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cake spice while velvety tannins provide support.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",18206
"6043","This Bordeaux-style blend is a mix of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot, tart and falling on the thin side. Wild raspberry fruit is accented with scents and flavors of earth and hay. It's aromatic, astringent, and well-suited for grilled meats.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",6043
"7978","This is a finely integrated, rich wine that shows impeccable balance between dusty tannins and juicy dark berry tones. The wood aging shows through in a smooth texture that gives a sense of richness to the ripe fruit. This is an elegant wine that can be drunk now although it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",7978
"78173","A direct and appealing wine, with notes of wild strawberry, wet stone, cherry and cranberry. It's fruity and concentrated while still retaining lightness of expression. Drawn out fruit flavors linger on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Canada",78173
"8737","With a healthy whack of Merlot (22%), this drinks a bit more like a Bordeaux blend than a varietal wine. It enchants with aromas of high-toned herbs, coffee, toasty oak and red cherry. The cherry and black fruit flavors are layered and tightly wound, with a pleasing mouthfeel. The tannins need time to unwind.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",8737
"30658","Perfumed with notes of white flowers, melon and peach, this off-dry wine is delicate on the palate with sweet stone-fruit flavors offset by brisk lemon acidity. It's straightforward in style but bright and fresh with a hint of honey that lingers.","White","Riesling","US",30658
"88868","The blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon has produced an attractive, fruity wine that's young and fresh. Light and bright, with delicious final acidity, its structure suggests it could age; drink from the end of 2015.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",88868
"105129","Reserved aromas of Rainier cherry, strawberry preserves, herbs and fig lead to plump, silky fruit flavors. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105129
"87659","Some vines at Bouscassé are 150 years old, which inevitably give this wine great depth and concentration. It is hugely structured, with very rich, intense black-plum flavors. The tannins are still developing.","Red","Tannat","France",87659
"16881","Sweet cherry and vanilla aromas are most noticeable in this soft, juicy Cab, with streaks of cassis playfully integrated throughout. Dry tannins and diesel oak build up steam on the finish, which is medium in length.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",16881
"88210","Earthy aromas of stewed plum and burnt leaves come in front of a drawing, raw palate with fresh acidity. Roasted, savory plum and berry flavors are fairly standard. This wine is dense but still lively on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",88210
"53995","Larger than life in terms of oak and tannin on the entry, this wine is elusive in fruit. Medium-bodied, it feels weighty and sharp-shouldered, while being clearly well-made and expressive of its appellation and variety. A cherry-vanilla note rings on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53995
"28870","The entry-level offering for Rajat Parr's luxury brand, this is barely noticeable on the nose, with mere hints of melon. On the palate, it's pleasantly Chardonnay-like but quite naked and flat in flavor.","White","Chardonnay","US",28870
"86710","This Barolo shows funky aromas of rubber and animal—common for the scorching 2009 vintage in this area. Despite its core of dark cherry fruit, this is very astringent and brutally tannic, with a short finish. Don't think this will evolve well.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",86710
"1369","This inky-colored zesty wine offers aromas of sour cherry, leather and a hint of dried herb. The extremely simple, easygoing palate shows red plum and a hint of clove alongside loose knit tannins.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",1369
"55399","Sanguine in pomegranate and red currant, this dark, effusive wine is generous in body and flavor, a tangle of vanilla, blueberry and cassis liqueur. Integrated in oak, the tannins take on a pillowy, plush quality that provides polish and focus to the wine. Enjoy from 2024–2034.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55399
"92854","From a small, new appellation in the north of Beaujolais, this wine is fresh and fruity. It has a cool feel to it—mineral and with stalky, crisp red currant fruit flavors. It's a style of wine that will benefit from serving chilled.","Red","Gamay","France",92854
"3393","This huge, fruity wine is packed with tannins and superripe fruits. It's a big wine in all senses, from its massive structure to its bold red berry flavors. There's a ripe, juicy end to this powerful wine.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",3393
"83868","Beautifully made, complex and complete, this full-bodied wine embraces seductive, spicy oak flavors, ripe fruit and a mouthfilling texture. Intricate vanilla, nutmeg and toasted baguette aromas lead to mulled plum, rhubarb and red-cherry flavors that coat the palate and linger on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83868
"56291","Made using fruit sourced from the high-elevation Haute-Serre estate, this wine is surprisingly elegant despite the high alcohol. It has a fresh blackberry flavor, with acidity that's balanced by the stewed-fruit richness. The tarry texture and firm tannins all promise long-term aging.","Red","Malbec","France",56291
"8512","Largely neutral lime and generic citrus aromas lead to the type of crisp, fresh palate Txakoli is known for. Tart, snappy lemon and orange flavors are lasting on a cutting finish.","White","White Blend","Spain",8512
"76568","This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (85%) along with 9% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, with most of the fruit coming from top sites of Cold Creek Vineyard and Stone Tree vineyards. Tightly wound up right now, it offers aromas of high-toned herbs, vanilla, spice and dark fruit. The palate is soft and flavorful, with plush yet delicate cherry flavors and fine-grained tannins that lead to an extended, fruit-filled finish. It's a very sophisticated wine with a long life in front of it. Best from 2021 to 2030.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",76568
"15820","A bit rugged in texture, with some jagged tannins, but the blackberry and cherry fruit is just fine, and the finish is dry and complex. Decant this young wine for a few hours to take the edge off.","Red","Merlot","US",15820
"69490","This Pinot shows the early promise of the exciting 2012 vintage. While it's just a basic appellation wine, it's rich in raspberries, cherries, blueberries and persimmons, with the fruit nicely balanced by crisp acidity. Enjoy this ripe wine now through 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69490
"69141","Quite green upon first impression, with bell pepper and a potpourri of green herbs on the front end. Feels healthy and crisp, with bite and structure to support the herbal flavors of tomato leaf, oregano, bell pepper and red berry fruit. Finishes with a minty, herbal aftertaste.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",69141
"77752","This light and herbal reserve has scents of pine needles and tart cherry. It spent 10 months in 25% new French oak, adding just a delicate hint of chocolate to the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",77752
"31276","Here is a deeply saturated Chardonnay with a golden color and thick notes of candied fruit, almond, butterscotch and a playful hint of pecorino cheese rind. The wine is thick and succulent in the mouth, with a soft approach that is capped by a piquant, almost spicy finish.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",31276
"103165","Lifted aromas of cherry Jell-O, spicy raspberry and a kiss of anise show brightly on the nose. The palate offers a slight tannic grip, with strawberry and cherry flavors leading to a lightly peppered finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",103165
"65130","Nice and aromatic, with cola, tobacco, fallen dried leaves and dark fruits. The palate has some scratch and acidity to it, but the flavors are good and lively, with a focus on dark plum and cherry. A bit more acidic than I like, but still healthy and very nice for varietal Carmenère.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",65130
"89786","A 10 month stint in oak has given this rich wine a seriously spicy character supported by dark chocolate and black fruit flavors. Syrah, Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon give this young wine tannins and a dark texture that needs to soften. Drink after 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",89786
"36474","With its dark color and firm tannins, this dense wine from 2,000-foot-high vineyards belies its light alcohol to give rich structure. It is fresh as well, with black currant juiciness coming through the spice and structure. It's still young, juicy and needs to age. Drink from 2015.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",36474
"12538","Tightly wound and floral, this wine has bright acidity with earthy cola and clove accents. Medium bodied, with some heft on the palate, it's ripe and rewarding in cherry and berry fruit flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12538
"10699","This is an herbal, low-alcohol style. Tart wild berry, lemony citrus, fresh herbs and a streak of iron combine gracefully. This is a new trend in Oregon, emphasizing non-intervention, subtle detail, low alcohol and neutral oak, and here it's been done well.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",10699
"54330","The price is right on this Grenache Blanc-Viognier blend, but it's a pretty ordinary wine. Shows sweet, fruity flavors of apricots, lemons and pineapples, with high acidity and a tug of mint and vegetable.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",54330
"37747","Delicate melon and white-peach aromas lend softness to this bristling off-dry Riesling. Laser-sharp in style, it balances lime acidity with bright stone-fruit flavor and long, mineral streaks.","White","Riesling","Germany",37747
"37818","At three years old, this wine is showing some interesting developed aromas of almond paste and petrol while the lightweight palate displays some nice butter tones. Pick this one up soon, for it seems to be fading.","White","White Blend","France",37818
"3930","Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",3930
"77421","Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",77421
"50158","Dry and crisp in acidity, with a silky texture, this is a polished Pinot Noir for drinking now. It has a rich array of cherry pie and sweet oak flavors, with earthier notes of pomegranate and cola.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50158
"93947","Shows lots of berry fruit, with touches of green olives, sweet herbs, cocoa, funky leather and cedar, wrapped into firm tannins. A funny wine. Good and rich, but struggles to achieve complex interest, especially at this price.","Red","Red Blend","US",93947
"13471","Light aromas of vanilla, coconut, exotic spices and blue fruit are followed by plump, tart fruit flavors and firm, somewhat astringent tannins. There are a lot of good things going on but the tannins need to be tamed.","Red","Tempranillo","US",13471
"58466","French oak, dark berry, underbrush and espresso aromas open with a whiff of coconut. The firm palate offers roasted coffee bean, sour cherry, cranberry and a hint of vanilla alongside vibrant acidity and fine-grained tannins that leave an assertive finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",58466
"97696","A deep pink color and substantial flavors make this wine a little bigger and more wine-like than many other rosés. The red cherry and raspberry flavors and medium body will pair well grilled salmon, paella, and even slow-cooked ribs.","Rosé","Rosé","US",97696
"15228","Valpolicella Vigneto Sant'Urbano offers very bright, albeit, one-dimensional aromas of red cherry and blueberry. The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and the wine promises to pair with light meat or pasta.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",15228
"83534","Another accessible, complex and tasty wine from the Beckett brothers, this blend of 68% Zinfandel, 18% Petite Sirah, 8% Grenache and 6% Syrah offers baked and fresh blackberry notes on the nose, alongside slate, lilacs and clove. The layered palate shows blackened berries, espresso and a touch of caramel that ride a decent acidity deep into the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",83534
"29989","The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now–2028.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",29989
"1200","Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1200
"38630","Cola, lemon and herbal aromas are like an Italian amaro in that they are rooty and earthy, with zing. This feels loamy and a bit creamy. Flavors of baking spices, vanilla, caramel, raspberry and pepper finish solid. Drink now.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",38630
"56608","Lively and forward with dried red berry and bramble notes supported by a sweet spicy cherry pie filling core. Medium weight with a short but clean finish. Drink now.","Red","Barbera","Israel",56608
"69228","Swirls of honey melt into ripe, rich pink grapefruit and peach in this decadently fruity Riesling. Off dry in style, it's lip smackingly sweet-tart, anchored by a zesty streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now–2016.","White","Riesling","US",69228
"63961","This is opaque, offering a lush collection of black fruit aromas on what amounts to a deep, dense bouquet. Layered and displaying excellent size and texture, it has saturated, meaty black-fruit flavors along with toasty, integrated oak. A powerhouse Malbec and maybe the best Ultra to date.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",63961
"57019","The Central Coast's Rhône pioneers deliver a savory style as usual, with scents of tobacco and creosote at the core, with red and blue fruit on the edges. It is dense and tannic on the palate with blueberry and blackberry fruits that are refreshed with acidity and lifted with mocha and mint spices.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",57019
"46937","Aromas of dark berry, baking spice, Alpine herb, graphite, iris and a whiff of game take center stage. The warm, enveloping palate delivers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, white pepper and anisette alongside velvety tannins and nervous acidity. Drink 2016–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",46937
"37507","Baked raisiny aromas are dominant and suggest overripeness. A heavy palate is rich but lacks flow and ease. Baked berry and raisin flavors are tasty but by now it's obvious that this lacks finesse and is off balance.","Red","Petit Verdot","Argentina",37507
"62341","A hearty bottle of Chardonnay with the simplest label you could imagine, it emphasizes earthy, oaky, buttery flavors over fruit components. This is medium-bodied, dry, rich in texture and moderately tannic.","White","Chardonnay","US",62341
"30575","While it does have a light texture, this wine is also rich. With intense red-currant fruit, totally crisp acidity and a fine citrus lift, the wine is both fruity and zesty. It will be best drunk from 2018.","Rosé","Rosé","France",30575
"60740","The color is midnight black and tannins are big and tough. The fruit is enormous, offering an explosion of blackberries and succulent plums, with hints of bacon, mu shu plum sauce, caramelized oak and freshly crushed black pepper. Stick this in the cellar until at least 2022.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",60740
"87959","This has black-skinned berry, mocha and tilled soil aromas. The concentrated palate doles out blackberry, clove and anise flavors alongside fresh acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2021.","Red","Barbera","Italy",87959
"66207","This salmon-colored blend of 90% Cabernet Franc and just a touch of Merlot is light, crisp and perfumed. It has a creamy mousse and a bright, red currant-inflected aftertaste. Drink now.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","France",66207
"2010","This delivers great Pinot-like character for its price tier. Give it credit for the dry silkiness, clean acidity and vibrant cherry, cola and oak flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2010
"93036","Nicely concentrated, smoothly polished and with good structure, this wine balances power and grip with a graceful mouthfeel and ripe but not overripe black-cherry flavors. Packaged with a wrap of gold netting, this wine has moderate tannins and medium to full body, so it will be enjoyable on all kinds of occasions.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93036
"62465","A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Syrah, this offers subtle aromas of black fruit and spice. The fresh palate delivers sour cherry, raspberry, blueberry and hints of black pepper notes alongside drying tannins. There's not much complexity but it's enjoyable.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",62465
"75762","This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",75762
"62703","This is the winery's first single-vineyard Merlot. Polished and dense, its aromatics are a multidimensional mix of cassis, espresso, cacao and tobacco. Firm and full, the flavors continue along the same lines, going deep into a thoroughly satisfying finish.","Red","Merlot","US",62703
"30981","Terrine is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo with a sweetish note that characterizes its nose. Aromas of honey-coated almond, cocoa butter, caramel and cherries take center stage.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",30981
"19892","Melon, spice and a suggestion of papaya wrap into a medium-weight wine with a solid fruit core. A streak of vanilla and some slightly bitter phenolics finish it nicely.","White","Pinot Gris","US",19892
"92629","While the nose is demure, with just a touch of rose petal remniscent of Gewürztraminer, this dry white gains body and power on the palate. There's a surprising intensity of stone fruit flavor that remains through the finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",92629
"65011","Juicy cranberry and cassis characterize this Cab, given ample time in bottle. Soft and medium in terms of weight and body, it's fluid in fruit, with a leathery finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",65011
"68675","Spicy and savory rather than simply fruity, this wine offers lively oak, smoke and black-pepper aromas and meaty, stewed-fruit flavors. It is full bodied, moderately tannic and very textural.","Red","Tannat","US",68675
"44936","This is 100% Riesling, but with less than half the residual sugar of the winery's 2011 vintage. Sourced from the Evergreen Vineyard in the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA, it has great acidity and purity of fruit, along with the minerality for which the region is known. Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling.","White","Riesling","US",44936
"53370","Red-berry fruits and a core of tannins make up a wine that has structure and the potential of some fine fruits. It is juicy with plenty of acidity at the end to give the wine a lift.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",53370
"43715","Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",43715
"68524","A soft, gentle, open wine that just lights on the palate. The texture is full, with acidity combining easily with pepper and green apple flavors. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",68524
"95781","Extra dry in style, this sparkling blend of 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Chardonnay succeeds dramatically in its ability to be salty as a cracker and crisp as a bite of green apple, followed by a lemon chaser. Tart and lengthy, it has persistent acidity and purity that's hard to resist.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",95781
"97461","Shapely and balanced, this bright Brunello shows a clean style that is reinforced by pristine aromas of forest fruit, cranberry, white cherry, cola, ginger and a spicy touch of ground white pepper. Bright acidity creates a cooling sensation in the mouth and would pair well with creamy or cheesy pasta dishes.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",97461
"105959","Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this stunning wine offers aromas of rose, small red berry and pastry. The silky palate offers strawberry, baked apple, nectarine zest, bread crust and nut alongside an elegant, persistent perlage.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",105959
"57782","Huge and rich, this offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated structure. It's packed with a seemingly sweet blackberry flavor that serves as a counterpoint to the firm texture. With both density and a dark edge, this will age over several years.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",57782
"57118","Very subtle but the alluring flesh of melon and peeled pear is hinted at here: this spells juiciness and easy, thirst-quenching joy. The palate gives a little backbone to all this pliable, soft fruit. An ideal, almost languid but very fresh summer wine.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",57118
"15594","Rich and rounded with a creamy texture, this wine is ripe with apricots and has a strongly mineral character. Full of fruit, the wine also has a texture that means it needs to age. Drink from 2021.","White","Chardonnay","France",15594
"97906","The fig, licorice and spice aromas seem somewhat dried out and tired. The cherry and cranberry flavors are smooth, with the tannins showing some grit. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",97906
"70717","A little unbalanced, with some overripe, pruny flavors and heat from high alcohol. The lack of fruity richness accentuates the tannins. Drink up.","Red","Merlot","US",70717
"1","This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",1
"61012","Red berry, violet, leather and crushed culinary herb aromas unfold in this ripe and rounded wine. The palate offers juicy red cherry, star anise and ground sage flavors alongside solid, seasoned tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2018–2027.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",61012
"1864","Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",1864
"104856","From grapes grown in the high altitude Castel Ringberg vineyard, Elena Walch delivers a vibrant, balanced wine that shows structure and finesse. It's loaded with sensations of Granny Smith apple, lemon zest, banana peel and an underlying mineral note that carries to the crisp finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",104856
"70584","This fleshy, tropical wine offers a wealth of rich peach, pineapple and golden honey flavor in a medium-bodied frame. It finishes light and bright, with an undercurrent of toasted oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",70584
"23976","Once again the Jerome Reserve delivers the goods—a fine core of ripe cherry fruit, wrapped in pretty new oak. It's full-bodied, round and textural, while retaining a crisp, well-defined focus. Barrel aging adds complexity, with streaks of coffee, licorice and dark chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",23976
"71791","This is a fun, easy drinker, showing zippy acidity and lots of mouthwatering clove and vanilla notes that frame flavors of Asian pear, orange and honeysuckle. It tastes just a bit off-dry, but it's refreshing and will pair well with Vietnamese and Ethiopian poultry-based dishes.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",71791
"102077","Bramble and forest floor, cherry cola and savory bresaola notes amount to pretty aromatics with less bulkiness in the mouth. The structure is there but this wine is a bit dry, sharp and less fleshy than many others.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",102077
"96610","Concentrated toast and golden apple notes carry onto the round, medium- to full-bodied palate, which comes with bright acids, a white peach flavor and a sense of flesh.","White","Pinot Gris","US",96610
"105773","The wine is soft and warmly ripe with simple raspberry fruitiness. It has a touch of crisp acidity to keep it in order and to help its refreshing character. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",105773
"58689","This is a dark, deep, big wine that's tannic and dry, with huge stuffing. Packed on the midpalate with blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it finishes in a delicious swirl of spices. Defines the modern style of Napa Cabernet: powerful, elegant and impressive. Drink now–2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58689
"23217","Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",23217
"71524","This small-production Cab is at first faint in subtle fruit but slowly works its magic, offering balanced layers of black currant and blackberry around soft, toasty mocha oak, picking up nuance and complexity on the way to a lingering finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71524
"85454","A pale salmon color, this rosé shows ripe notes of cocoa-dusted cherry and strawberry alongside sweet citrus oil. Creamy and full in the mouth, it's a richer rosé that can stand up to heartier fare.","Rosé","Rosé","South Africa",85454
"90113","Cusumano is a terrific Sicilian estate that offers both high-end expressions and a consistent line of value wines. This well-priced Nero d'Avola is fresh, clear, fruit-forward and easy to drink.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",90113
"67494","Conference pear and yellow Mirabelle plum notes make an appearance in this wine. The palate, which has some noticeable spritz, evokes more green citrus with its dry slenderness. Yet, it finishes full-fruited.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",67494
"4538","For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4538
"50275","Spicy, lemony acidity balances out a classic barrel imprint of oakiness and toast in this medium-bodied, concentrated wine. Silky-smooth on the palate, it rewards patience in the glass and will pair well with rich, creamy foods.","White","Chardonnay","US",50275
"87165","Aromatic for Cabernet, this wine possesses notes of black currant, green pepper, blackberry and herbs. It drinks slightly off dry, offering lighter flavors with a tangy feel and chalky tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87165
"49977","If you're looking for a decent everyday Chardonnay at an inexpensive price, consider this one. It's dry and creamy in texture, with slightly sweet, oaky tangerine and pineapple flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",49977
"71475","Lighter in color, this is a fairly heavy-duty take on the grape, with cola, red cherry and cinnamon notes on a nose that seems hotter than the alcohol level suggests. Licorice, caramel, smoky Scotch and kirsch flavors consume the palate.","Red","Grenache","US",71475
"96803","This wine has very little going on aromatically and tastes slightly burnt.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96803
"1165","Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one. The wine, aged in 80% new French oak, is elaborate and opulent, but the tannins are strong, giving the palate a lockdown astringency. It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",1165
"12204","Tomato leaf features on the nose and palate of this wine, a characteristic of the Awatere Valley (a subregion of Marlborough). Gooseberries provide a fruity base to this medium-bodied wine, but fade quickly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",12204
"88910","A blend of Braucol and Tannat, this a dark-colored blockbuster, with firm tannins that are mitigated by the smooth, rich blackberry flavor. It has power, immense concentration and great density. Age for 3–4 years.","Red","Red Blend","France",88910
"74704","This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is an Oregon winery's take on a super Tuscan red. Aromas are volatile and those high tones carry into the flavors. Light raspberry fruit, high acidity, and a sharp astringency characterize the wine.","Red","Red Blend","US",74704
"52661","Tasted in May of 2012, this shows an immaturity, where all the parts haven't yet come together. It has a big, rich black-cherry flavor, with elaborate smoky oak, brisk acidity, firm tannins and heat from the alcohol all vying for dominance. Needs time; cellar it until 2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",52661
"48988","Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity. Already a good one to ponder, but should be even better from 2009–2011. Just 750 cases made.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",48988
"3578","This is the best of the 2015 vineyard designates from Soléna. It's a pretty wine with bright raspberry fruit. There's a gentle touch of stem, which helps to frame it, and a dark vein of espresso and cacao running through the tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3578
"51323","This wine's fresh and boisterous nature make it great for barbecues. Aromas of blueberry jam, condensed lilacs and smoked meats are very inviting. The fruit-forward palate combines smoked boysenberries and blueberries with roasted pork, dried oregano and a unique salt-and-pepper component.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",51323
"26091","Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?","White","Torrontés","Argentina",26091
"61694","Lavish freesia and honeysuckle perfume persists throughout this bristling, bright Riesling. It's delicate and spry in mouthfeel, but rich, round swirls of tropical fruit penetrate deeply on the palate. It's irresistably unabashedly forward and fruity.","White","Riesling","Germany",61694
"48444","Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this tart and sharp-edged Washington Syrah sports bright berry fruit and just a hint of earth in the tannins. The acids are a little chalky, and there is a slight medicinal quality in the back of the mouth as the wine finishes.","Red","Syrah","US",48444
"50360","Forward and flavorful, this brings together five different grapes from eight different vineyards, though it is mostly (70%) Wahluke Slope Cabernet Sauvignon. I found a hint of funk, cooked raisin, and lots of baking spices. Penetrating, unusual flavors, but overall not quite together.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",50360
"27059","This dark-pink wine has aromas to match, recalling black cherry, strawberry and cola. The palate is surprisingly more restrained, offering fruit punch and a wide array of spice-rack flavors. It makes a perfect pairing for Indian or other rich and spicy Asian cuisine.","Rosé","Rosé","US",27059
"86696","An appropriately rich wine, full, toasty and dense. The fruit is beautifully balanced with ripe acidity, just a touch of spice, citrus and an opulent, full-bodied character. It will certainly age, but is already very drinkable.","White","Chardonnay","France",86696
"50358","A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",50358
"13078","An amplified green nose smells like lime infused with bell pepper and asparagus. A citrusy snappy palate is brash, while pyrazinic green flavors are balanced by citric notes. This is a typical San Antonio SB: racy, green and citric.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",13078
"95176","The acidity that is a characteristic of the vintage shows through in this wine. It clashes with the tannins to give a strangely unbalanced wine.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",95176
"7533","This solid and powerful wine comes from a chateau right in the walls of Saint-Émilion. A dense texture brings out tannins and the wood-aging flavors.

"74955","An all-embracing blend of many of the white Douro varieties, this is all about fruit. From the crisp citrus flavors to the softer melon and pear, the wine is delicious to drink at this young exuberant stage. It could also keep a few months when the acidity will have calmed down a little.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",74955
"69233","This spicy-smelling, dry wine is well balanced, generous in flavor and a pleasure to drink. Aromas of black pepper, clove and black cherries carry the nose, while on the palate, ripe and delicious flavors spread across the smooth and lightly tannic texture.","Red","Zinfandel","US",69233
"11303","This blend of Syrah (58%), Merlot (33%) and Malbec (9%) offers immediate appeal, with ready-to-go aromas of raspberry compote, mocha and cranberries. The polished red-fruit flavors show depth.","Red","Red Blend","US",11303

"8008","Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend. Gritty in the mouth, with black cherry, licorice, herbs, raisin and lasting sweetness on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",8008
"4120","Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits—citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.","White","Riesling","US",4120
"101271","This is an unoaked Chardonnay, with a fresh and lively bouquet of white flower, stone fruit and lemon zest. The cool-climate Alto Adige growing conditions help develop the purity and intensity of the grape's aromas.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",101271
"32354","A touch murky and leafy at first, with vanilla and red fruit aromas. Runs crisp and tangy, with length, a lean structure and snappy pie cherry, red plum and vanilla flavors.

"23038","With an opening scent of freshly crushed raspberries and cherries sprinkled with black pepper and drizzled with anisette, this is an inviting wine. A Grenache-based Rhône blend, it turns soft and a little sweet and simple in the mouth, but is very easy to enjoy.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",23038

"45210","Planted on a relatively cool site for the Russian River, the Laguna Ridge, this Pinot is velvety and lush in baked strawberry and black raspberry, a celebration of finely grown, ripe fruit, with sharp-edged acidity and waves of savory mocha. With pronounced oak that mellows in the glass, it should only become more interesting with a few more years in the cellar, through 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45210
"12799","This wine is Cabernet Sauvignon (63%) blended with Merlot (19%), Petit Verdot (12%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of black cherry, herbs, cranberries and dry chocolate are reserved while the palate offers hedonistic fruit flavors, with lightly dry tannins that hopefully will smooth out with additional time in the cellar.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",12799
"66170","Cascina delle Rose is one of the denomination's brightest gems and its Rio Sordo is a textbook Barbaresco. It has an alluring and multifaceted bouquet of lilac, violet and wisteria, along with hints of spice, truffle and earth. The palate is focused, with intense cherry and spice notes balanced by firm but fine tannins and freshness. It already shows ample complexity and will age beautifully.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",66170

"42042","Hits all the classic well-oaked Cabernet notes: cedar, tobacco, vanilla and cassis upfront, with similar flavors coursing through from start to finish. It's not quite as full bodied as some Australian Cabernets, which isn't a bad thing, finishing with silky yet firm tannins. Drink now–2016.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",42042
"47512","Coconut, baked plum and French oak aromas come together in the glass. The taut, medium-bodied palate offers red cherry fruit with hints of toast, espresso and star anise, framed by fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",47512
"71532","Sumptuous notes of sugar cookie and honeydew perfume this lavish, full-bodied bottling. It's dry on the palate with piercing white-grapefruit acidity, but balanced by a rich, almost creamy, mouthfeel. The finish lingers luxuriously with a murmur of lime-zest astringency.","White","Riesling","Germany",71532
"81327","A streak of lemon-lime acidity jolts the senses on this unctuously ripe Riesling full of sweet orange and tangerine flavors. It's dancing and light on it's feet, yet powerfully packed with honey and nectar. Penetrating and persistent on the palate.","White","Riesling","Germany",81327
"59665","A healthy dose of potpourri and lavender kick off the nose of this bottling, with sweet pine, plum and raspberry waves inviting one in for repeat sniffs.

"29298","Created by Vigouroux as a hommage to Malbec in Cahors and Argentina, this has the structure of Cahors and the rich smoothness of Mendoza. Complex, powerful, full of ripe fruit, it's impressively juicy, textured and full of acidity at the end.","Red","Malbec","France",29298
"96861","Smoky, gritty aromas of road tar are accented by briar patch, cherry and cassis notes. This is a generous Cab that bumbles a bit on the palate. Flavors of cassis and baked plum benefit from integrated spice notes, while this offers tastes of chocolate and herbal spice on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",96861
"75015","This field blend of 50% Grenache 32% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre, the lots co-fermented, impresses with dense blue fruit and meat and lavender accents. Big and brawny on the palate, it reveals more leather and black pepper intrigue as it opens in the glass.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",75015
"12182","Great potential is evident in this young wine from a recently planted vineyard. Spicy cranberry and raspberry fruit shines forth, buoyed by natural acidity. The weight and fruit intensity are just right, and the wine shows excellent depth of flavor, with a finishing lick of cocoa.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12182
"103751","Released at seven years of age, this Syrah is soft, tannic and dry. It has rich flavors of blackberries and blueberries, and seems far younger than it is. It's interesting and complex, and grows in the glass. Could go for a few more years.","Red","Syrah","US",103751
"57460","You can tell this is going to be a top-of-the-range wine by the heavy bottle. Named after the apple orchard that was the original vineyard of the producer, it is powerful and concentrated, with blackberry fruits and a solid, firm texture that will soften. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",57460
"56825","A bit heavy and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, with jammy, pie filling cherry and cola flavors. Turns chocolaty on the finish, like pudding. Delicious, but the structure is off.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56825
"92111","Earthy tea and cola flavors unfold within layers of soft, supple texture in this impressive wine, its midpalate marked by meaty texture and moderate weight. Bright acidity keeps it fresh while a burst of blueberry carries into the long, spicy finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92111
"106137","Brawny tannins meet mild acidity in this powerful, rich wine that's full-bodied and decadent. Chocolate, mocha and caramel notes are etched into its soft, rounded layers of generous red fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",106137
"58059","Smoky and oaky with a punch of dark chocolate, this full-bodied, brambly red bursts with clove, cinnamon and blackberry flavors. It develops further layers as it opens and is built for either cellaring or immediate enjoyment.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58059
"1115","This Rioja opens with a jumpy, lively, candied red-fruit aroma. It feels solid, rubbery and stout, with dark fruit flavors that are accented by mild resin and butter notes. Feels a little sticky on the finish, with firm tannins.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",1115
"13009","With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",13009
"41132","This is a wine for those who crave density and ripeness. Black currant, mint, fudge and burnt caramel aromas show powerfully on the nose, while the strong tannic frame leaps onto the palate to deliver caramel, milk chocolate and black cherry-syrup flavors. Roasted coffee and butterscotch touches lead into a long Cognac-like finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",41132

"26531","This study of a low-yielding clone produced a compelling range of aromas and flavors. The nose leads with iodine, seaweed and coffee scents against a backdrop of tangy black fruit. The palate shows more nori, lavender, black pepper, asphalt and dried blackberry flavor, finishing on a lingering oaky note.","Red","Syrah","US",26531
"68348","There's a deep smoky element here that is offset by bright tones of cherry and blackberry. This is a wine that would pair beautifully at an outdoor barbecue with hamburgers and baby back ribs.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",68348
"23160","Very young now and a bit rude, with upfront primary fruit flavors of cherries, black raspberries and new oak. Needs time for all the parts to knit together. Cellar through 2009, at least, and should hold for a while afterward.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",23160
"73507","This overtly woody wine smells like cedar chips and fresh-cut oak and tastes like pine, menthol and cherry candy. While it's fun to pick out its different flavors, this is not what most people expect from Cabernet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",73507
"23413","A pale-colored wine with crisp, tight red-currant fruit, this is light and lively. Drink this simple, attractive wine now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",23413

"53170","The invigorating freshness of Villa Wolf's Gewürztraminer is an unusual change from often duller, flabbier versions. While not deeply complex or concentrated it's floral exuberance and crisp peach and pear flavors are refreshing and quaffable. Drink now through 2018.","White","Gewürztraminer","Germany",53170
"10311","Tight tannins support a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc. Black fruit, tobacco and leather give it a robust profile, finishing full bodied and ripe.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",10311
"53665","Tropical scents of guava and cherimoya with the mineral edge of concrete lead the aromatics on this Carmel Valley wine. Sharp acidity at first sip massages into softness soon afterward, upholding the nose's rocky promise as well as delivering lime-zest tang throughout.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",53665
"67248","The first release annually from the estate vineyard, this is a solid effort, seemingly infused with scents and flavors of pine needle, pine tar, earth and bark. The fruit is in the background, and leans toward cranberry and brambly blackberry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67248

"96831","Aromas suggesting ripe plum, exotic spice, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco take shape in the glass.

Drink 2018–2026.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",96831

"105202","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (43%), Merlot (31%), Petit Verdot (12%), Cabernet Franc (9%) and Malbec was assembled after just a little more than a year in barrel and then aged for an additional year in 500-liter French oak puncheons. It's 85% free-run juice and locked up with notes of graphite, dark chocolate, cassis and wood. The flavors are elegant, tart and tightly coiled, surrounded by chewy tannins that still need some time in the bottle to be tamed.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",105202
"63005","This luxury Cava is entirely clean and pure on the bouquet. The palate is bright, lifted and zesty for a 2006, with apple, dry spice and lingering citrus notes. The body is defined by its yeasty weight and foam but it's not heavy or dull. Only 100 cases of this beauty were made. Drink now–2015.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",63005
"29916","An estate-grown wine from an Oakville-based producer, this is an opaque, concentrated expression of black fig and gunpowder, girded by sturdy tannin and a richness of black cherry and berry. It reveals the power of the appellation well, and a ripeness of the vintage.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",29916
"9371","Light in color, with depth and clarity, this wine shines with dusty black cherry and pomegranate flavors and an ethereal texture of tension and earthy acidity. Clove and orange zest touches dot the long finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9371
"58112","Dry aromas of leafy, spicy red-berry fruits register as complex and mature. Medium in body, it has integrated tannins and acids. Flavors of lightly baked cherry and sweet red currant are earthy and finish with notes of cocoa powder, raspberry and plum. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","Argentina",58112
"11743","Underbrush, dark spice, mature berry and balsamic notes emerge in the glass.

Drink 2019–2017.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",11743
"38315","Young, tannic and juicy, filled with sweet blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors, and well oaked, having been aged in 100% new French barrels. Those are the raw facts. The wine itself shows the pedigree of this fine estate, and will no doubt pick up bottle nuances over the years. But it seems to lack the precision of the great 2001, 2003 and 2004 vintages. Try after 2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",38315
"17729","A rich, full Petite Sirah with a taste of cola and spice followed by ripe raspberry and blackberry. A very yummy version of the variety from one of Livemore's most promising vineyards.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",17729

"86919","Jammy and dark, with sweet, candied, offbeat aromas. Heavy in the mouth, with baked plum and berry flavors and then a reduced, short finish. Thick almost to the point of cloying. A strange wine.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",86919
"46506","This low-production Pinot doesn't leave much to the imagination. It's all about fruit. Cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, root beer and pepper flood the mouth, housed in a crisply dry, savory mouthfeel. Could develop bottle complexities over the next six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46506
"57832","Gentle white blossom, white currant and Golden Delicious apple unite on an intriguing, subtly aromatic nose. Earthy, stony elements lend depth and resonance. This is so integrated that the delicious, ripe apple fruit is completely embraced by earth and subtle yet distinct autolysis. This is rich in style—aided by dosage—rounded and very elegant, with a sufficient structure for food pairing.","White","Chardonnay","England",57832
"85712","The winery's best-barrel bottling of Chardonnay, this excels on all fronts, showing lemon peels, browned butter, creamy lily and pan-seared apples on the light, crisp yet savory nose.

"85580","This is a dense yet dry wine, with a ripe blackberry jam aroma and flavor. Firm tannins give it pleasant grip; splashing it into a decanter will open it up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85580
"68640","Guigal's long-term aging in new barrels has left a sheen of oak on this wine, but the underlying material is excellent, with mocha and plum notes supporting cedar and vanilla. The finish is long and savory, with a distinct granitic edge to the flavors. Drink now–2020.","Red","Syrah","France",68640
"37304","This cleverly named wine, which is a blend of several vineyards, is an astounding value. It comes very close to the quality of Pali's single-vineyard, far more expensive Pinots, with complex cherry, cola and smoky cedar flavors. Absolutely one of the best under-$20 Pinots in California.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37304
"26391","Roussanne is one of the more difficult grapes to get right, and these Rhône masters pulled it off this vintage with brilliance. Fascinating honey-laced melon cream and mango mochi aromas show on the dessert-like nose. The palate is bone-dry, however, with melon and honey mustard-like flavors, proving truly unique yet refreshingly delicious.","White","Roussanne","US",26391

"92639","Juicy, ripe peach and blossom notes perfume this full bodied blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Blanc. It's moderately concentrated, with delicate flavors of fresh stone fruit, pear and toast, but enlivened by a streak of sunny lemon acidity. Finishes briskly.","White","White Blend","US",92639
"94042","Though this bottling still needs a year or so of patience to truly shine, it's a great example of cool-climate low-alcohol Syrah. Dark in the glass, it shows tar and lavender, but the core is like a black and blue pepper-crusted steak, with charred beef, raw beef and strong spice converging. The palate is all about raw meat, fresh-ground black peppercorn and squeaky tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",94042
"93428","With his background in Bordeaux, François Lurton knows how to handle Sauvignon Blanc to good effect. This wine is crisp and herbal, suggesting the cooler vineyards of the southwest in its style. It is packed with citrus and spice flavors. Refreshing and delicious, this is an immediately drinkable wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",93428

"19827","Emmolo has been producing decent Merlots for years, and this '09 is reflective of their style. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not very exciting either, offering pleasant cherry and oak flavors that are a little sweet.","Red","Merlot","US",19827
"92751","Smoky, oaky aromas and vibrant spicy fruit flavors make this wine stand out from the pack of simple, ripe wines. It is very full bodied, high in alcohol, moderately tannic and definitely oaky.","Red","Zinfandel","US",92751
"23467","This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.","White","Viognier","Argentina",23467
"24777","Simple aromas of apple cider come with a hint of match stick and brine. This feels round and fleshy, like an unfiltered apple cider. Flavors of generic citrus and apple juice finish pulpy and round. Drink now.","White","Verdejo","Spain",24777
"54033","Extremely alluring aromas of black plum and blackberry meet with touches of caramel, vanilla and fresh rose on the nose of this bottling.

"68150","Fresh fruit and lively raspberry juice flavors are totally up to the minute. The attractive orange-pink color emphasizes the ripe character of the wine's fruitiness.","Rosé","Rosé","France",68150
"103336","Apart from fresh citrus peel and yeasty savoriness, this Grüner delivers a full herbal repertoire of chervil and rocket, watercress and lemon balm. The spine is of lemony acidity, painting a picture of thrilling, concentrated freshness, interspersed with peppery layers of interest and a nearly endless herbal finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",103336
"51733","Elegance and subtlety are the hallmarks of this medium-bodied, ultrasmooth wine. It pulls all the elements together, from the nervy, red cherry aromas to the moderate raspberry flavors, the great balance of acid and tannins vs. alcohol, and the velvety mouthfeel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51733

"86104","Aged two years in French and American oak, this is a dark and meaty wine, with black fruits and a hint of blood. There's a bit of a hole in the midpalate, but streaks of cola and licorice revive the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","US",86104
"90102","This stunning red is all about finesse and light. It opens with lovely scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and balsamic aromas while the radiant, almost ethereal palate delivers crunchy red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and mineral intensity. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity and firm but elegant tannins. While it's so tempting now, hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2033.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",90102
"3188","Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3188
"26468","Ripe white peach and sharp lime peel qualities interplay on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard, which is now under the quality-focused ownership of the Foley family. That lime zest comes through on the palate too, cutting through the creamy midpalate and adding a pinpoint edge to the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",26468
"40928","Though only aged in 30% new oak—half French and half Hungarian—the wood is far out front here with notes of vanilla and butterscotch overtaking the cherry. It's light in style with vanilla flavors throughout.","Red","Sangiovese","US",40928
"58453","Gentle notes of creaminess and ripe pears signal a soft, creamy wine with lots of texture and body. The rounded body carries some weight and is edged with a bitter marzipan note. All this is countered by fresh acidity, more creamy, nutty notes and a vanilla finish.","White","Pinot Gris","France",58453
"43254","Nice and dry, a full-bodied red wine whose dusty tannins and dried herb notes testify to its Alexander Valley terroir. Not a blockbuster, but rich enough in cherries and blackberries to satisfy. Now–2013.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43254
"46928","Fresh green florals and melon rind lend a breathlessly cool tone to this elegantly composed dry Riesling. Forward flush yellow plum and gooseberry flavors are offset by lime zest, fresh sage and bristling acidity. It finishes with persistence and length. Drinks well now but should improve through 2020.","White","Riesling","Germany",46928
"35063","A shade off from the past few vintages, but still a nice Pinot Noir. Showing crisp acidity and some firm tannins, it's sweet and forward in black raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. Drink over the next 2–3 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35063
"92204","This is a very powerful Chardonnay, brimming in guava, golden mango, white peach, pear and Key lime pie flavors, to which smoky oak adds even richer layers of butterscotch and caramel. A crisp edge of peppery acidity provides a clean, zesty balance to this enormous wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",92204
"19072","For those looking for a leaner, earthier but still-stylish Cabernet, this is the ticket. It's very dry, with soft Alexander Valley tannins and flavors of blackberries, cherries and herbs. This elegant young wine could easily develop fascinating bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",19072
"26812","Hints of brine and sea water lend rusticity to pressed-apple flavors in this dry, delicately framed wine. Fruit flavors seem rather oxidized on the palate, but a tart, lemony zing adds some freshness.","White","Chardonnay","US",26812
"16169","Ripe, concentrated blackberry, cassis, oak and graphite aromas set up a burly palate that's stacked to the max. An oak-based note of popcorn sits atop a heavy palate with deep black-fruit and graphite flavors. An oaky finish with salty blueberry and cassis flavors is bolstered by fresh acidity. Drink through 2022.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",16169
"76585","Sweet and lithe, this is a wonderfully clean and pure expression of Riesling eiswein. There's no botrytis, only sweet pineapple, apple and citrus flavors that finish on lingering notes of orange and lemon. This should last a while in the cellar, but there's really no reason to delay gratification.","White","Riesling","Germany",76585
"3790","Aged in large oak casks, this fresh Ripasso makes good use of minimal wood intervention that comes forth as light spice and cinnamon. The core of this wine, however, consists of pulsing black fruit and mature cherry.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",3790
"105125","Peppery, rich and low in pronounced oak, this estate-driven Cab has softened tannins and is most definitely drinkable now, with pungent, bright fruit and a lengthy, leathery finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",105125
"88540","They can't call the grapes old vine, because the vineyard is only 15 years old. But it was planted from clones that constituted an old vineyard that contained Petite Sirah, Carignane, Mataro and Alicante Bouschet. The wine is robust and rustic, with bright, briary berry fruit and spice flavors that will stand up well against any roasted meats.","Red","Zinfandel","US",88540
"70989","Rich and textural, this gloriously mixes raspberries, cherries, baking spices, cola, cocoa and coconut components, all woven together seamlessly. It's forward and juicy, yet built for medium-term aging. Drink now through 2026.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70989
"46819","This semisweet Riesling balances an intensely fruit-forward profile of ripe yellow cherry and quince flavors against a backdrop of crisp, tart tangerine acidity. It's sunny and bright, yet elegantly composed, with a bristle of fresh herb notes that linger on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",46819
"30610","This medium-bodied white delivers mature pear, yellow apple and white peach aromas and flavors. It's riper and rounder than usual but also boasts terrific freshness and elegance for the hot vintage.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",30610
"11710","This is a plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay ideal for casual sipping. Pear and citrus flavors combine easily, finishing on a soft note of chalk-dust.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",11710
"95603","The aromas of black currant, black cherry and plum announce this warm vintage wine. The flavors are plump and easy drinking, trailing slightly toward the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95603
"21844","Made by longtime Domaine Chandon still-wine Winemaker Joel Burt, this red offers delicious value, sourcing from sites within the Russian River, Sonoma Coast and Carneros AVAs. Coolness and restraint are the guides, the wine light in color and texture, with just touches of spice, strawberry and tea. It finishes juicy, with a citrus flair.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21844
"49758","This Chardonnay from Marcel Grillet's horse-plowed biodynamic vineyard called Pizay is still very young, showing a candy, confected flavor that needs to calm down. It has the potential for attractive fruit from 2016.","White","Chardonnay","France",49758
"101878","Crafted in a New World way, this displays toasty, creamy oak and baked apple aromas. The palate is healthy and bold, while flavors of popcorn, white bread, butter, honeydew and banana maintain freshness and clarity across the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",101878

"86837","A little pricey for the quality, but still, this is a super-drinkable Chardonnay. It's semi-sweet and brisk in acidity, with a cut of minerality supporting ripe orange, pineapple, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",86837
"62968","Ripe and rich, this has blackberry fruit and well-integrated tannins. A year's wood aging has given it structure and concentration. The wine will mature well and gently. Drink from 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",62968
"64633","Powerful aromas of black tea, black currant, anise, clove, and soy sauce jump from the glass. The palate follows suit, with plenty of fruit and mint giving depth. The tannins are grippy and massive, but there is ample acidity to keep them in check. The finish is long and intense.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",64633
"75920","Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",75920
"58217","Cline has done a very nice job with this Zin, which comes partly from Lodi. Although it's very soft and won't age, it has a velvet and silk purity that carries rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, sweet vanilla and pepper.","Red","Zinfandel","US",58217
"37280","Gros Manseng takes the lead in this ripe and full wine with a fragrant floral character as well as great fruitiness. It's fresh while also having a creamy, smooth character. It is ready to drink, but will be better from the end of 2015.","White","White Blend","France",37280
"69675","This forward, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon is plummy and ripe with notes of black cherry preserves and cassis liqueur. It's plush on the palate, with soft, sunny acidity, but moderate alcohol keeps it fresh and quaffable.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",69675
"72037","Small percentages of Croatina, Oseleta and Forsellina grapes are added to this traditional Valpolicella blend. It's bright and fruity, with cherry and blueberry notes that are backed by a touch of smooth spice and a polished finish.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",72037
"42252","A gorgeous blend of Friulano and Ribolla Gialla, this dense and rich white would pair with crab or lobster. It opens with creamy tones of stone fruit and citrus mousse, followed by slight touches of spice and vanilla.","White","White Blend","Italy",42252
"90313","Sonoro is a pure expression of Merlot. This vintage was particularly good to the soft, cherry-scented grape variety, and in fact, this pleasant wine delivers lush notes of thick, ripe red fruit and chocolate. For now, the wine is still vibrant and racy, but may not age well.","Red","Merlot","Italy",90313
"86913","Rough and stemmy smelling, and sort of scratchy. The palate is acceptable but that's about it, with creamy, sweet, wayward berry flavors. Finishes medicinal and a bit weedy. Similar in quality to the ‘07 Urban Tempranillo.","Red","Tempranillo","Argentina",86913
"102370","Sporting a lovely front label, this holds a mix of Syrah and Petite Sirah from Rutherford with Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. The wine is a bit muddled, one-dimensional in plum and black cherry, and ultimately softly simple.","Red","Red Blend","US",102370
"86794","Made in the New Zealand-style, this savory Sauvignon Blanc has bright acidity highlighting racy flavors of citrus, green melon and lemongrass.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",86794
"55566","Notes of light grass, green melon rind and a touch of green pepper unfold in the bouquet, while the palate boasts more citrus-based flavors of lime and tart gooseberry. This is bright and lively, with a short, mouthwatering finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Israel",55566
"26734","Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas.","White","Pinot Gris","US",26734
"60928","Very perfumed, this lightly sweet and poised wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng. It has cool acidity as well as wonderfully fragrant fruitiness. The texture gives the wine the potential to age, so drink now and until 2017.","White","White Blend","France",60928
"95630","Initially shy, the nose eventually reveals subdued aromas of dark berry, sunbaked earth and blue flower. The medium-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, anise and a hint of crushed herb while rounded tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2019.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",95630
"88723","Fresh hibiscus, black plum and smashed olallieberry meet with vibrant florality and wide range of dark spice on the nose of this blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah. A pepper-laced structure releases flavors of black cherry, cola and a touch of charcoal on the well-hewn palate.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",88723
"56820","Opens with a mix of minerality, citrus and powdery white fruit scents. The palate packs tang and zest, while the flavors of green apple and lemon are lean, crisp and citric through the finish. Fresh but a little sharp and monotone.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",56820
"37213","Ripe notions of orange and ripe apple fizz on nose and palate. This wine is fresh, dry and full of ripe citrus notes. It's an easy but wonderfully dry Riesling that spells juicy joy.","White","Riesling","France",37213
"96645","Opens with crusty, rock-solid aromas of mineral, shoe polish, herb and dense black fruit. This is a thick but smooth-bodied Cabernet with richness and sweet flavors of blackberry, cassis, fine herbes and brown sugar. Mild tannins, excellent structure and length define the finish. Drink now through 2016.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",96645
"11959","This winery has had a reputation for making Cabs in a leaner, more ageworthy style, but that is no longer true, to judge by this '05. It's as ripe and fruity as anything out there, and immediately drinkable for its beautiful blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. Still, the tannins are considerable, and the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best now and through 2013, at the least.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",11959
"54071","Beautifully smooth, this medium-bodied and easy-drinking wine seems to melt in the mouth. Black cherry, blueberry and light smoky aromas segue to more cherry and chocolate flavors on the palate, where the texture is soft and appealing. It's a harmonious blend of Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","US",54071
"29928","A blend of Grenache and Cinsault, this wine comes from old vines in an estate revived in 1997 by Gilles Pons and Pascale Massenot. It's all about aromatic fruit, with grapefruit, pineapple and red currants playing in the flavors. A rich element contrasts pleasurably with the tight, crisp acidity. The wine will benefit from a few more months aging, so wait until the end of 2016.","Rosé","Rosé","France",29928
"15620","Simple aromas of lemon and lychee are just fresh enough, while the palate offers good feel and pithy, somewhat bland flavors of the same fruits that appear on the bouquet. The finish is lemony, and overall this is a good, basic Torrontés to drink as soon as you can.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",15620
"68148","Raspberry jam, menthol, cooking spice and espresso aromas lead the nose. The palate offers tart red cherry, crushed raspberry, thyme, anise and ground green pepper. Bracing, slightly astringent tannins provide support but need to soften up. Drink after 2018.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",68148
"81189","A simple, five-grape blend. Perfectly sound sipping white, clean and short.","White","White Blend","US",81189
"25542","A solid effort for North Fork Cabernet, which has a tendency towards inconsistency. This has dark cassis fruit underlined by a weedy, herbal streak and a dried-fruit nuance as well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25542
"24113","Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend has rich, pleasant cherry, currant and mocha flavors, enhanced with sweet toasty oak. A soft, luscious wine with a lot of popular appeal, it's drinking beautifully now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",24113
"96572","This bottling from John Sebastiano Vineyard is a great example of how a light Grenache can entertain needy palates. Sagebrush-laced aromas of wild thyme and tree bark mesh with tart pomegranate, red currant and a touch of red-cherry pie on the nose. The tea-leaf-laced sip shows raspberry, red plum and red apple, which just enough tannic structure.","Red","Grenache","US",96572
"79242","Starts out nice, with a good, fruity raspberry nose, but on the palate are tastes of tomatoes, with a dry, astringent, tannic finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",79242
"12719","Golden in color, this wine opens with a decadent nose of baked apple and raisin bread, and the sweetness of vanilla oak. Full bodied and round on the palate, it balances the richness and concentration with lengthy acidity on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",12719
"40345","Fashionably pale in color, this light, bright and very poised wine is made from old-vine Mourvèdre, Grenache and Cinsault. With its acidity and fresh red currant and raspberry fruits, it is still crisp and could age a few more months, although why wait?","Rosé","Rosé","France",40345
"5232","A tiny-production wine that is exuberantly brambly and wild, this has a bouquet of juicy black and red berries at its core. Balanced and elegant despite the generous palate, it has softened tannins and a thickness toward the finish. offering accents of black pepper and brown sugar.","Red","Zinfandel","US",5232
"36192","Soft and supple in lemon and melon, this 100% varietal white was given time in both stainless steel and neutral oak, the combination rewarding in a rounded, approachable mouthfeel that's both creamy and ripe. Stone fruit makes an appearance, before the wine finishes lean and tart.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",36192
"56276","Flavors of blackberry, black cherry and a streak of cola ignite the palate, with a layer of pure mineral underneath. At first a bit delicate, this never pauses, introducing umami and cinnamon highlights on the lingering finish. It's fresh and elegant, with a more gentle fade than some of the more potent Syrahs from Cayuse.","Red","Syrah","US",56276
"16145","This warm style of Sauvignon Blanc has easygoing acidity and gooseberry fruit flavors. It's lightly tangy, with a bright, crisp texture.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",16145
"98576","The ??? Pinot from Ayoub is a true mystery wine, made with fruit sourced from unnameable but exceptionally high-end sources. Flavors are subtle and elegant, with lovely floral top notes over firm, well-balanced fruit and chewy tannins. Still quite young and compact, this wine needs another five years at a minimum to blossom. Drink 2020–2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98576
"30786","A two-vintage blend of Cabernet Franc and Malbec, the Deep River Red has a roasted character that's dark and flavorful, with notes of cassis, coffee and cacao. It's full bodied and dense, with notes of graphite and pepper.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",30786
"33136","The nose does not want to give more away than fresh yeast but the palate shines: there are distinct ripe lemon flavors, almost lemon confit, with subtle edges of white pepper that practically tickle the palate. A subtle but rewarding wine with a slender palate.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",33136
"33054","A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.","Red","Zinfandel","US",33054
"23418","Barrel aromas are in the lead here, with notes of sawdust and cedar, along with Band Aid and gamy notes. Dark fruit aromas are in the background. The full-bodied flavors reveal more of the same, showing a lot of heat.","Red","Syrah","US",23418
"102615","A Syrah-based Rhône blend, this wine is soft, sweet and simple. It has powerfully ripe raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and spice flavors, and is hot in high alcohol.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",102615
"25039","Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.","White","Viognier","US",25039
"19969","Made from a several sites within the appellation, this wine is marked by full-barrel caramelization and an inviting nod to brioche. Toffee and cinnamon interweave within its rich, thick waves of texture. Tropical mango allows for a hint of fruit amidst the darker flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",19969
"104969","This blend of Syrah (56%), Cabernet Sauvignon (22%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and Mourvèdre saw just a trace of new oak (10%). It delivers them all with notes of berry, coffee, raw meat, herbs and tar, with lighter-styled fruit flavors and tart acidity.","Red","Red Blend","US",104969
"37737","The nose is shy but promises development with its heady note of chamomile. The palate reinforces this soothing, herbal and balm-like feeling even more, seemingly dissolving dried chamomile aromas in a sea of fluid, fresh lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and comes with a wonderful lightness of touch. Despite the ripeness of the 2012 vintage this has ease and a spring in its step. This wine is lovely now and will continue to evolve for a long time. Concentration will make sure of that. Drink 2017–2030.","White","Riesling","France",37737
"68077","Held back probably to tame fierce acidity, and it's still a young, lean, tart wine. Fresh, juicy flavors of lemons drink very clean and vibrant, but it's austere stuff. Try with goat cheese on toast.","White","Chardonnay","US",68077
"90946","This expression beautifully showcases Moscato d'Asti's typical sweet, musky aroma, along with notes of peach, citrus, white flower and honey.","White","Moscato","Italy",90946
"74170","A notion of light citrus peel rises on the nose before a nicely packaged selection of Asian pear, fennel-like herb and lemongrass appears. Thick, rich and nearly full bodied, the wine settles into a crisp, tangy finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",74170
"32194","A tremendous effort from Spy Valley, this easily eclipses the winery's regular Sauvignon Blanc. Fig, melon and hints of vanilla mark the nose, while the palate amps up the citrus component, providing delineation to the nectarine flavors. It's on the full side of medium-bodied, with a silky, slightly creamy texture and a lingering finish that seamlessly blends citrus and stone fruit.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",32194
"17987","This wine is soft and rounded, ready to drink with its rich black-fruit character and fully integrated tannins. It holds a blend from five different parcels on the estate, ripe in berry fruits and fragrant with the wood aging. Acidity gives a lift at the end.","Red","Gamay","France",17987
"48854","Sweet aromas of almond paste and stone fruit, as well as green apple, mark this wine fermented in stainless steel tanks. It has a slight effervescence and a hint of lime and Asian pear on the finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",48854
"1034","This wine has a rich, velvety character that gives it solo sipping appeal. Pepper and mocha on the nose flow into dark fruit and mocha flavors on the palate. Paired with a good structure and long finish, the wine is both elegant and intriguing.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",1034
"9539","With the smooth Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz making up the body of this ripe wine, it has a generous, fruity character. The tannins are a support to this fine fruit and rich aftertaste. Drink this young wine now for its fruit or wait until 2018 for it to soften and round.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",9539
"32972","A textured wine, it's still very crisp, tight and closed up, only just hinting at a more fruity side. Waiting a few years will reveal the delicious citrus, peach and vanilla flavors that will show how generous and rich this wine really is. Don't touch before 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",32972
"78430","Négrette gives its typical earthy character to this spicy, fruity wine. It's full in the mouth, aromatic with black fruits bolstered by a light tannic edge. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","France",78430
"8041","Medium-intense scents of honeydew, baked apple, peach pit and dried wildflowers are direct and forward on the nose, while flavors of citrus and melon fill the smooth but not flabby palate. Solid acidity lifts the mouthfeel and lends freshness through the finish, which is otherwise full of rich notes of apple pie, honeycomb and orange marmalade. Drink now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",8041
"56249","Aromas of cola nut, bacon, blackberry, licorice and wood smoke announce a raw rugged palate that's not nearly as plump and lush as it normally is: a clear reflection of the cool 2013 vintage in Rioja. Dry peppery black-fruit flavors finish with toasty oak and licorice notes. Although rough and rugged now, this should improve little by little through about 2030.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",56249
"19845","Accents of flint and charred apple skin mingle with the orange rind and pear flesh notes on the nose and mouth. Round and flabby on the palate, with a short but clean finish.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",19845

"95768","Very light in the glass, this fascinating exploration of the underripe side of Pinot Noir shows green olive and crushed cherry tomato aromas on the nose, with prevalent bay leaf, green peppercorn and pine resin. Those elements converge on the sip to make a cranberry, spicy herb and eucalyptus nut tea, which is tangy and complex.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95768
"36349","This Bordeaux-style blend is colored like inky violet and has matching aromas of black plums, cassis and violet.

The finish is characterized by an impressive burst of brightness and a lingering caramel note.","Red","Red Blend","Turkey",36349
"74532","Subtle white fruit—think pale yellow-plum and pear flesh—mingle with fern and yeasty notes on the nose. The palate is zippy, light and easy to like, with fresh, bouncy fruit.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",74532
"101767","Somewhat locked up at present, the aromas offer notes of brown stems, crushed flowers, dried earth and green olive, with the fruit lurking in the background. The palate mixes savory and red-fruit flavors that play off each other all the way through the finish, showing a lot of elegance and persistence.","Red","Syrah","US",101767
"94596","A big, bold, fruity wine, this has great tannins, ripe black-currant fruit and an attractive sense of structure. It has all the juiciness and freshness of 2010, but is a wine for aging over 3–4 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",94596
"25497","Dazzles now for its richness. Shows those classic Howell Mountain tannins, but they've been so tamed and refined, you can drink it now. The flavors are spectacular, over the top; pure Cirque du Soleil spectacle of blackberry, currant and chocolate acrobatics.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25497
"36522","Made by the same team as neighboring Château Chasse-Spleen, the wine from this 17-acre estate is fruity, with the potential for a smooth texture and rich fruit.

It has new wood as well as red-berry fruit flavors, under the direction of consultant Michel Rolland. Let the wine come together and drink from 2019. Suau is part of an international group of family wineries.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",57633
"9798","This is a bright, fruity, rounded wine with a soft texture. It's full and ripe, with melon and green plum notes, plus a touch of bitterness on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",9798
"39224","Lots of wood on the nose, and some scents of pickle that reflect the American oak barrels. The flavors follow along, spicy cranberry and raspberry fruit, with streaks of pickle and wood and a burst of alcoholic heat in the finish. The blend includes 17% Mourvèdre.","Red","Syrah","US",39224
"55831","A seductive and easy-pleasing wine, this ripe and lush beauty, named after the winemaker's daughter, will draw you in with its sultry notes of ripe brambly berries, forest floor, cured meat, sweet smoke and spice. The mouthfeel is like velvet and the finish long, with a gorgeous mocha- and licorice root-flavored finish.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",55831
"45453","This Cabernet Sauvignon emphasizes delicate, feminine aromas that are rare to find in the variety. Small berry, toasted almond and herbs are buoyant and fresh. But Cabernet's hearty character definitely comes through midpalate thanks to jackhammer tannins and thick concentration. Drink after 2012.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",45453
"66864","A little scoury, but delicious, with ripe strawberry, raspberry and orange-preserve flavors. Mostly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay, it shows fine acidity and a Champagne-like yeastiness. Drink now.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",66864
"58559","Dry, certainly not softened by the rich 2003 vintage, but showing fresh fruit, black currants and dry tannins. It's restrained, finely balanced, drinkable now, leaving a soft final impression.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",58559
"38634","A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 7% Canaiolo and 3% Colorino, this opens with aromas that recall charred earth, blackberry, blue flowers and a whiff of game. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, mint and brown baking spices alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",38634
"22990","This blend of Bordeaux grapes with Syrah is rich and spicy. It is made to be drunk young, with touches of toast and a dense texture that brings out the perfumed character of Syrah balanced with Bordeaux structure. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from late 2016.","Red","Red Blend","France",22990
"76745","Flowery aromas suggest air freshener. This feels plump, round and oily. Salty orange flavors are just ripe enough to be good, while this pushes the limits of brininess on a finish that offers a taste of the ocean.","White","Albariño","Spain",76745
"23889","This wine has a dry, firm and dark character. It also offers acidity to go with the tannins, ripe black fruits and a dense, concentrated structure. The wine should be aged longer, so drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",23889
"535","Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit.","Red","Grenache","US",535
"95461","Shrouds of leafy herbs and savory stems lend a fresh tone to this brisk yet fruity, concentrated Cab. Crisp blackberry and currant flavors shine bright and pert on the palate, framed squarely by lingering strikes of tannin and acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95461
"99633","Rose hips and petals, potpourri, ginger snaps and dark strawberry show on the lush nose of this bottling by Don Lorenzi, whose Italian family has been making wine for generations. Strawberry and lush cherry flavors meet with increasignly prominent nutmeg and allspice once sipped. The palate is quite hearty and full of dried fruit.","Red","Grenache","US",99633
"1272","This is an open and ready-to-drink wine that has soft tannins and juicy blackberry fruit. With 50% Aragonez in the blend, it is has a smooth character that brings out plenty fruit and not too much structure. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",1272
"40186","Toasty oak yields a smoky nose, but the fruit aromas are mild and hidden, showing only basic apple notes. With ample oak, the wine is slightly resiny in feel, with tropical fruit flavors followed by a wave of oak flavor. Ditto on the finish, which feels solid and good.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",40186
"14231","This is a rich-textured, full-bodied wine with lots of dark fruit flavors and thick tannins softened by a touch of sweetness. It has a very dark color, strawberry and blackberry aromas and darker, more concentrated flavors including dark chocolate and blueberry.","Red","Red Blend","US",14231
"31761","Aromas of toast, truffle, game, plum and underbrush lead the nose. The lively palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and baking spice alongside soft tannins. Drink through 2017.","Red","Barbera","Italy",31761
"28200","Here's a full-bodied, dry, tannic Syrah that displays elegance and balance. The blackberry, currant, grilled meat bone, mocha and licorice flavors finish in a swirl of peppery spice. Could develop bottle complexities through 2010.","Red","Syrah","US",28200
"88860","Hints of pine and forest floor lend a cool, alpine feel to elegant white peach and blossom notes in this dry-style Riesling. The palate is ripe, rich and dense with stone fruit flavor, yet balanced with bracing lime acidity and fresh, green herb notes that linger brightly on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",88860
"81057","Oxidative aromas of macadamia nuts, walnut oil, marzipan and dried lemon are happily cut by a soda character on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers preserved lemons, seared marshmallow and nut oils, proving fairly fat on the sip.","White","Viognier","US",81057
"63482","Being 100% varietal, aromas of barrel spice are prominent at present, followed by black fruit. The fruit flavors are sweet but still lighter in style, with lightly grainy tannins backing them up. It's surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage and region.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63482
"45270","Caramel and white-chocolate aromas lead to very ripe, buttery flavors, a sense of sweetness and an almost thick texture in this full-bodied wine. Practically as rich and creamy as a milkshake, it will delight some drinkers for its unctuousness.","White","Chardonnay","US",45270
"89203","Tightly herbal and packed with green fruits, this is a full and ripe wine. It is still very young with its initial fruit flavors still intact. It will calm down over the next few months and be better to drink from 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",89203
"105330","A complex, ripe wine that has rich red fruits, dark cherries and a serious undertow of tannin. The name comes from what the producer calls the alchemy between wood and fruit, and certainly the balance is just right. It has structure and dense tannins along with a juicy fruitiness. The wine is now ready to drink.","Red","Gamay","France",105330
"67558","Subtle aromas of freshly cut grass and crisp Asian pears make this clean, dry Riesling a refreshing sipping wine. A tingly acidity and citrus pith notes linger playfully on the palate.","White","Riesling","US",67558
"53360","This blend of the white Trincadeira das Pratas and Arinto is soft and perfumed. It has some ripe acidity and an open texture. The aftertaste brings in some attractive melon flavor. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",53360
"63542","Strawberry with a very faint touch of rhubarb makes for a very inviting nose. The palate continues the strawberry theme with a full, fresh and luscious but dry fruit expression. This is juicy, fleshy and moreish, drink soon.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",63542
"46621","Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.","White","Riesling","France",46621
"70238","A beautiful blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Montepulciano and Merlot, Pelago is a landmark wine for the Marche. It's soft and lushness, with an underlying firmness. Flavors of rich chocolate and black cherry ride long on the finish. This wine can age for 5–10 more years, or it can be consumed now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",70238
"86518","Spiced plum, dried raspberry and cherry-cough-drop aromas are attractive. This feels medium in body, with plumpness cut by fresh acidity. Flavors of dried cherry and baking spices finish solidly and smoothly.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",86518
"16340","Extra fruity, packed with strawberry and crisp red currants flavors, this is all freshness, richness and clean acidity. It has some weight but this just emphasizes the fruitiness.","Rosé","Rosé","France",16340
"77474","The wine is closed and dense, with dark tannins as well as smooth caramel flavors from wood aging. It reveals concentration, black fruits and rich, exuberant potential. Drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",77474
"10176","Oak spice, mint, cocoa powder and berry aromas set up a medium-bodied palate with pinching tannins and depth. Spicy plum and berry flavors are toasty and finish with dark aftershocks of bitter coffee, black pepper and tobacco.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",10176
"66705","A sturdy wine, sporting plenty of roasted cherries and caramel on a medium-weight frame. Turns strongly sour on the finish, where the flavor of charcoal dust also intrudes. —J.C.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",66705
"75886","The word No refers to no oak and no malolactic fermentation. The wine is sharp in acids and totally dry, but with super-ripe flavors of pineapple, pear, peach and green apple marmalade. Very clean and mouth-cleansing.","White","Chardonnay","US",75886
"5559","A clean, crisp nose of spice, red fruit and minerals on the nose leads into bright, fresh flavors of oak and spiced fruit on the palate. Appealing acidity, firm but smooth tannins and an elegant, subtle character give the wine poise and aging potential. A great food wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","South Africa",5559
"19656","Mango and melon blend with crushed vitamin on the nose of this Viura-Malvasia-Garnacha Blanca blend. This feels wide and fairly full, with modest acidity. Resiny flavors of sawdust shade apple and vanilla notes, while this is oaky and nonaggressive on the finish.","White","White Blend","Spain",19656
"54784","Powerful, hard-driving aromas of herbal red-berry fruits and spice are enticing. This feels juicy, firm and full, with chewy tannins. Toasty flavors of plum, cassis and pepper show an herbal side in front of a racy, spicy, finish that emphasizes olive and eucalyptus.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",54784
"44490","The nose already promises pleasure. Layers of grapefruit and mirabelle, lemon and tangerine, apple and honey present a series of contradictions—not to mention delicious flavors—creating immense and irresistible tension. This is only going to get better if you can refrain from drinking it all. Pure thrill and lots of concentrated, zesty promise.","White","Riesling","Austria",44490
"17891","The largely unexplored Faro denomination in the northern point of Sicily is producing some of the island's best work. The promising Nocera grape variety is used here and vintner Salvatore Geraci is one of its biggest proponents. This blended red is finely embroidered with subtle notes of forest berry, cassis, leather and spice.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",17891
"81135","From vines on the plateau to the west of the village of Saint-Émilion, this is a light, fruity wine. Its acidity and tannic structure lend a crisp texture to its black currant fruit. It will probably broaden as it matures, so drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",81135
"56667","A blend of Falanghina and Coda di Volpe, this offers aromas that recall pineapple, banana and jasmine. The juicy, simple palate offers pear, white peach and a hint of flint alongside fresh acidity.","White","White Blend","Italy",56667
"35371","This wine has yummy, fresh fruit aromas and flavors and a supple texture. The cherry, raspberry and plum notes are easy to savor due to medium body, light tannins and rather soft acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",35371
"81200","Spicy and herbal upfront, with cassis fruit that seems just a little dried out, giving way to molasses and brown sugar. It's a medium-bodied Cabernet with slightly drying tannins and a coarse-textured finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",81200
"27053","A singe of charred wood lends toasty complexity to this berried brambly wine. It's supple and concentrated yet crisp and light on its feet. The finish is long, marked by a touch of savory beetroot.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",27053
"36001","This is jammy and bulky from the get-go, with heavy fruit aromas leading to a saturated, dense palate that feels thick. Baked, blackened flavors of sweet blackberry, chocolate and mocha mark the palate.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",36001
"64077","The vintage was a good one for Bella's Zinfandels, and this one, which contains a splash of Petite Sirah and Carignane, is their best. It is quintessential Sonoma County Zin, dry, yet rich and heady, and floods the mouth with ripe raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic spices. Production was only 300 cases.","Red","Zinfandel","US",64077
"102572","Spicy, meaty flavors like black pepper and beef broth blend with substantial fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, dry and rather sophisticated wine. It's almost a meal in itself, and well-balanced.","Red","Red Blend","US",102572
"35928","The top cuvée from Roubine, this unusual blend of Tibouren and Clairette is intensely perfumed and ripe and with a fine stylish character. It is an impressive wine with yellow fruits as well as red currant and citrus. This food friendly wine should age a bit, so drink from late 2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",35928
"101534","A solid if unexciting Cabernet, dry, tannic and balanced. Shows blackberry and black currant flavors that are tinged with smoky oak. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101534
"45744","Everything about this Cabernet argues for cellaring. With a little Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's enormously complex, with fruit flavors that range from blackberries and cherries to black currants. There's also a pleasant herbaceousness that suggests sweet green peas. The tannins are significant, so let it develop bottle complexity until 2016.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",45744
"51857","Cherry candies, grapefruit and watermelon grace the nose. The light-bodied palate shows little intensity and focuses on an underripe strawberry note.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",51857
"45866","Bright, almost luminous Meyer lemon and orange hover like a halo. The palate intensifies this ripe but zesty purity even more. The fruit is pulled into lemony focus at the concentrated core of this sleek, moreish Viennese original.","White","Riesling","Austria",45866
"3122","This wine is soft, herbal and earthy. It has a lovely smoky creaminess, as well as hints of white stone and tropical fruits, but lacks a certain vibrancy.","White","Chardonnay","US",3122
"67162","This deep black-cherry colored wine has a fruity nose of pomegranate and strawberry. It is smooth on the palate, with flavors of black currant, plum, white chocolate, lavender and a hint of baking spice. The finish is characterized by a splash of tart strawberry.","Red","Syrah","Israel",67162
"76468","From vineyards owned by Paul Buisse, this is a ripe, tropical-fruited wine. It is light in texture, with herbal and grassy flavors on the finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",76468
"95056","From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria comes this exciting wine. Green and Kalamata olives show on the nose, along with crystallized cherry, juniper, fig, unripe strawberry and Mediterranean spice. It explodes with acidic life on the palate, where underripe cherry and tart strawberry flavors mix with green peppercorns, forest underbrush, wet gravel and thyme.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95056
"79985","This rare library release from Jamesport is another great testament to how age worthy Long Island wine can be. At 12 years of age, it's remarkably fresh, with crisp, red cherry and plum flavors, layered with shades of clay, savory herbs and brine. Lively with acidity, it's powerful on the palate but elegant in style.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",79985
"29931","The main estate of the Bunan family is a citadel from the 18th century. This wine is perfumed, rich with pepper as well as ripe red fruits. Structure from the dominant Mourvèdre in the blend gives some tannins and a sense of power. Drink from early 2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",29931
"92970","The Birch Creek fruit creates a sweetly fruity, forward Merlot, with warm, ripe cherry candy flavors. Cabernet adds some structure to the midpalate, and depth to the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",92970
"43315","This wine comes from this vineyard's original Cabernet blocks planted in 1980. Wound-up aromas of woodspice, herb, pencil lead and dark fruit are followed by concentrated but still supple black-fruit flavors. It's high up on the hedonistic scale, accentuated by a lengthy finish. Decant to let it open up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43315
"46327","Remo Farina is a standout producer with a beautiful portfolio of Amarone and Ripasso wines. This expression shows youthful berry tones that are backed by notes of freshly grated cinnamon and nutmeg. Its consistency is dark and rich.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",46327
"44884","A toasty, smoky wine, with freshening acidity, crisp green and white fruits and an attractive edge of toasty oak. The wine is lively, fresh, delicious, very poised and vibrant.","White","Chardonnay","France",44884
"82012","This wine opens with a strong herbaceous character, as scents of forest floor and menthol accent the red plum and cherry core. Fine tannins and medium weight make this an accessible wine now, with hints of black pepper and licorice spice that develop on the finish.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",82012
"84536","Abundant cherry notes show on the nose and palate of this wine—red, black and very ripe. It's juicy, fresh and straight-forward, with lovely, peppery spice. A picnic wine par excellence.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",84536
"101460","Offering one of the more creative gimmicks yet, this bottle comes with a small pencil to decorate the mostly blank front label. The wine inside conveys aromas of lemon rinds, light peach and salt that give way to flavors of pineapple, apple blossom, yellow pears, sea salt and appropriate tanginess.","White","Chardonnay","US",101460
"37778","Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",37778
"82034","A satisfyingly rich wine, with dusty tannins and a chunky, fruity structure. It has plenty of the typical black currant flavors of 2008, spiced with new wood. Ripe enough to drink now, but it will age.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",82034
"84082","This late-release GG is a stunning showcase of how just a few years of bottle age impact a dry, richly concentrated Riesling. Yellow peach and grapefruit tones shine brightly still, but are glazed by layers of slick, penetrating minerals. While moderate in alcohol, it feels dense and creamy on the palate. The finish meanders almost endlessly, punctuated playfully by strikes of lemon-lime acidity. It's singing now, but should improve till at least 2020.","White","Riesling","Germany",84082
"70861","While the year is not one of the great Port vintages, it has produced some finely structured wines like this that will mature relatively quickly. It comes with great fruit that was teased out of the grapes in traditional open stone lagars. It is, of course, dense and full of tannins as well as fruit. It will develop well and could be drinkable soon (say by 2018) for its fruit although it will then age for many years until 2030 and beyond.","Port","Port","Portugal",70861
"24385","This Colchagua Petit Verdot, something you don't see much of, is huge and saturated. Woody, spicy aromas include scents of chocolate but also pinched rubber and olive. Black-fruit flavors are herbal and give way to char, toast and chocolate notes, while heavy tannins take over on the finish.","Red","Petit Verdot","Chile",24385
"99207","A blend of fruit from Dineen, Meek and Sheridan vineyards, this wine delivers aromas of black cherry, orange peel, sweet spices and fresh herbs. The black cherry flavors convey polish and depth.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99207
"74035","Vanilla, barrel spice, coffee and dark fruit aromas are followed by generous black fruit and barrel flavors that show exquisite balance. It's impossible not to enjoy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",74035
"67147","Very ripe, dense and concentrated. Although it's totally dry, the wine shows massive, sweet flavors of blackberry and cherry fruit. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the length of finish. Cellar this youthful beauty for 6–7 years and see what it does.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",67147
"66704","Pretty standard stuff here, with thin, watery aromas that carry only faint traces of wood and apples, and watery flavors. It's clean, but hot from alcohol, with high acidity. —S.H.","White","Chardonnay","US",66704
"28777","Balanced and fresh, mixing berries, fresh herbs, black cherry and dried mushroom components, this medium-long, estate-grown wine is designed for significant short-term improvement. Delicious already, it seems poised to evolve gracefully through 2021.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28777
"79036","Reduced on the nose, this massively intense and tannic wine is big, dense and juicy, broadly etched in leather, blackberry, currant and black licorice. Full-bodied and oaky, it shows the concentration of the vintage and the ripeness of the appellation and style.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",79036
"102818","Pretty, supple purple fruits infuse this interesting blend of Tempranillo, Grenache and Mourvèdre. No one grape dominates; the flavors are smoothly integrated and well-matched, with an undercoating of smoke, licorice, pastis and coffee. Nicely polished tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",102818
"74880","This wine is fresh, bright and light, with citrus and ripe yellow fruits. Crisp, light and aromatic, it's ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",74880
"93972","Grassy overtones and freshly clipped boxwood turn this into an aromatic, fragrant wine with a lithe body but lots of aromatic depth, with hints of tropical passion fruit underneath. Drink now.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",93972
"13187","The deep orange-gold color makes this wine look like a late-harvest version, and fragrant floral and apricot aromas continue that impression. But the wine is dry, light-bodied, somewhat tannic and chewy in texture and nutty in flavor. It fits the distinctive Donkey & Goat style of skin-contact, non-intervention winemaking.","White","Roussanne","US",13187
"69637","Perfumed and exotic, the wine has a touch of lychee as well as fresh acidity, both given lift by a lemon zest flavor. With a crisp aftertaste, it's a lively wine for drinking now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",69637
"86005","Filled with bright, bouncy cherry-berry fruit and imbued with a slightly viscous mouthfeel, this fun, gulpable Shiraz won't break the bank. Its easygoing nature makes it worth having on hand for your next barbecue. —J.C.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",86005
"50983","Pressed blue flower, ripe black-skinned berry, baking spice, tobacco and leather aromas come together on this round, full-bodied wine. The delicious palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla, cinnamon and licorice while pliant, velvety tannins offer elegant support. It deftly combines power and finesse. Drink through 2024.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",50983
"49145","A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this—it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age. The pure, long and intense finish is a delicious promise. Drink 2017–2037.","White","Riesling","France",49145
"96300","This is one of the better wines emerging from Southern California, specifically San Diego County, where vintners should bet on Italian varieties. Pretty and fresh aromas of rose petals, crushed pomegranate, allspice, hibiscus, sandalwood and light licorice lead into a palate full of cedar-laced raspberry flavors, rounded by hints of molasses and chai.","Red","Montepulciano","US",96300
"48748","Ripe peach and yellow cherry aromas take a turn towards the tropics on the palate of this intensely fruity wine. It's semi-dry in style with a slightly candied tone but balanced neatly by tart lemon­-lime acidity. Drink now.","White","Riesling","US",48748
"13446","A directly appealing wine with little obvious new oak influence to get in the way of the clean pear and pineapple flavors that are stitched together by just a touch of sweetness.","White","Chardonnay","US",13446
"72394","To judge by the aromas—a complex herbal mélange containing hints of cabbage leaf, tea and acacia blossom—this includes a healthy proportion of stems. On the palate, the black cherry and plum fruit asserts itself, while the texture is crisp and silky, lingering through the finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",72394
"91387","Cherries of every kind—red, black, jam, pie—are the essence of flavor here, along with red licorice, cola and sandalwood. It's a nice, structurally interesting and bone dry wine, with firm tannins and a good cut of acidity. Ready now.","Red","Grenache","US",91387
"59928","Lip tingling lime acidity sends a jolt through this lusciously fruity wine. Off dry in style, it juxtaposes sweet-tart lemon and honey tangerine flavors against steely, piercing minerality.","White","Riesling","Germany",59928
"54786","From a 1,400-foot-high site, this wine combines 86% Zinfandel with 14% Petite Sirah, which deliciously exude blackberry, blueberry, kirsch and leather. Smooth, soft and juicy, it adds nutmeg, chocolate and oak as it goes, finishing with structure and length. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Zinfandel","US",54786
"50931","Coming in at a strikingly low alcohol for the vintage, the fruit in this blend doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with strong aromas of freshly sliced jalapeño along with leafy herbs. The flavors are tart and elegant, broadening on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",50931
"89495","The combination of mouthwatering acidity, steely flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, white flowers and honey, and finesse make this slightly oaked Albariño super drinkable. With a trace of honey, it will be perfect with Vietnamese fare, smoky ham dishes, or fried chicken with potato salad.","White","Albariño","US",89495
"70693","This is a lean wine that seems to be missing the fruit. It has an austere quality with a strongly tannic element and mineral acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",70693
"85575","This blends fruit from DeVoto in the Sebastopol Hills with grapes from Terra de Promissio, Umino and Alder Springs vineyards. It's soft and thick, with rich, ripe flavors of cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, a sizzling sense of cola spice underlying it all.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85575
"7869","New management, farming and winemaking practices at this producer, including a focus on smaller production, are remarkably on display in this delicious white. Golden pear and crunchy apple provide an unctuous, delightfully balanced experience that's crisp in underlying acidity and subtle baking spice.","White","Chardonnay","US",7869
"51754","With rich, honeyed flavors of apricots and oranges, this flashy, dramatic Chardonnay seemingly tastes as sweet as a pastry, but the amazing thing is that it's actually dry. It's brisk in coastal acidity, with complex nuances of toasty oak and a creamy mouthfeel. For drinking now.","White","Chardonnay","US",51754
"29398","An enormously rich wine, flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sweet cured meat, anise and black pepper flavors that sink in deep and last long into the finish. An unusual blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, it's powerful in tannins and bone dry. Grill up your best steak and enjoy.","Red","Red Blend","US",29398
"87984","Aromas of yeast, grape skins and dust are less than compelling but not offputting. This is a high-acid, shearing type of rosé, tasting citrusy and a bit sour. A mild orange flavor is found on a crisp, racy finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",87984
"31834","There's no mistaking the variety here, with its notes of red chili pepper and green pepper along with snuffed-out cigar. The palate is broad and generous but still shows elegance, with its cherry and spice flavors. It's an intriguing example of the variety.","Red","Carmenère","US",31834
"77451","There is a light pepper and spice character that comes through in this wine. It adds to the wine's simple fruitiness with complexity, pushing the rosé into a food friendly character. The wine is ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",77451
"91762","Il Musico is a unique dessert wine that opens with aromas of resin, pine nut, caramel and candied fruit. The viscous mouthfeel is sweet and rich, but there's also a really nice blast of refreshing lemon zest on the close.","White","Moscato","Italy",91762
"41760","Sassy right off the bat, with feline aromas and juniper. Feels wet, bouncy and soda-like, with a mix of prickly green-fruit flavors and sweetness. There's more of the same on the finish; it's briny and melony sweet.","White","Verdejo","Spain",41760
"28620","Toasty, oaky aromas of graphite, pepper, barrel char and black fruits properly announce a palate of chewy tannins and several layers of blackberry, cassis, barrel-spice, toast and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty depth on the finish only adds to the package. Drink through 2030.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",28620
"5328","This wine has a geranium aroma and a strangely perfumed character. It is light and fruity although not likely to develop much.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",5328
"81541","This Pinot is on the thin side, rather stingy in fruit. But it's dry and crisp and clean enough to be called elegant. Shows modest cherryskin flavors that are generously spiced.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81541
"76806","Pretty good for the price, with ripe cherry, raspberry and oak flavors. Fine for burgers, pasta with sausages or pork buns. The blend is Cabernet, Merlot and Petite Sirah.","Red","Red Blend","US",76806
"35681","Strained, jumbled aromas of mustard, horseradish and green grass fail in many ways. This feels wide, edgy and tartaric, and thus overall balance is shaky. High acidity creates a sense of sourness, while this Tannat from Salta finishes choppy and acidic.","Red","Tannat","Argentina",35681
"32908","Lots to like in this Lake County wine. It's very crisp in acidity and clean, with a minerally scour to the lemon, lime and kiwi flavors. On the minus side, it's rather sweet, which gives it a fruit juice quality.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",32908
"84563","A whiff of clover jumps from the glass, then this dark, juicy wine rips into a dense cassis flavor. Ripe and sappy, it has just the right touch of new oak layered onto the finish.","Red","Malbec","US",84563
"42740","A dense, slightly raisiny nose indicates ripeness, but the palate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenere and Petit Verdot is healthy and not overly heavy. Creamy, oak-infused flavors of plum and berry are uncomplicated and balanced, while pastry, vanilla and berry fruits grace a long, harmonious finish. Drink through 2015.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",42740
"475","This is an expressive example of this variety, especially considering the stainless steel aging. The aromas are bright, with notes of apple, pear and melon. The cantaloupe flavors are broad and fleshy, lingering on the finish. It brings a lot of appeal.","White","Chardonnay","US",475
"50981","Opening with aromas of crushed violet, ripe plum and black pepper, this is one Amarone that seamlessly combines a hefty structure with finesse. The ripe, savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, cake spice and tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins that lend it a polished texture. Drink 2017–2026.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",50981
"31008","A really wonderful wine. It seems classic Dry Creek Valley, in terms of bright, spicy fruit, as polished as marble on the surface, with maybe less stuffing than, say, Napa. But that's not to put it down. Racy tannins and dry acids make it competitive in a worldwide market.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",31008
"15634","Not much going on with this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has watery flavors of citrus fruits and apricots, with a hint of oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",15634
"106194","Shows opulent, vibrant flavors of pineapple and orange jam, with accents of butter, cream and vanilla. Very flashy and decadent, if a little obvious. This should pair nicely with rich shellfish dishes.","White","Chardonnay","US",106194
"70507","Aromas of toasted hazelnuts and yeast give way on the palate to oranges, cloves and golden delicious apples. The Bolly house style of weight and heft is well displayed here, balanced out by a long, taut finish.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",70507
"30806","The ripest of Breggo's '06 Pinots, the Ferrington stars red fruits, such as cherries, raspberries and persimmons, mingling with intricate Asian spices and a hint of mocha. Absolutely delicious, this silky, complex wine is pure pleasure.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",30806
"71134","Good and dry, with a firm scour of acidity and an earthiness to the pineapples and pears. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price.","White","Chardonnay","US",71134
"54776","A complex nose of cherry, leather, anise and tobacco leaf set the scene for flavors of ripe cherry and fresh raspberry with notes of vanilla and spice. Despite the depth of aroma, this wine is medium bodied in the mouth and culminates in a fresh finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Bulgaria",54776
"93671","This Brunello has a warm, earthy personality embodied by its wild mushroom, leather, tobacco and ripe fruit notes. There's crème de cassis and cherry liqueur as well. The wine's mouthfeel is bright and crisp.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",93671
"41947","Apple and melon aromas are mild, straightforward and devoid of oak. A chunky melony palate doesn't have much stuffing, while this tastes of mild peach, papaya and other tropical fruits. Overall, this is inoffensive but hollow.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",41947
"59239","There's a suggestion of sweetness underlying this pleasant, crisp and fruity wine. Though labeled 100% Sauvignon Blanc, it does little to showcase varietal character. However, as a fruit-forward, quaffable white, it works quite nicely.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",59239
"47234","This wine's tight nose gives little away. Its light-bodied, dry and slightly spritzy palate delivers fresh lemon fruit, which lingers into the zesty finish. This easy, fresh and ready for immediate drinking.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",47234
"83289","This is simple yet rich style, with dark berries, chocolate and toasty oak notes. For those who like their powerful, dense reds, this comes at an affordable price.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",83289
"95819","Yalumba's western outpost has been steadily improving the quality of its wines, and the 2010 21 Barriques represents its top wine to date. The dark fruit flavors are accented by ample amounts of charred oak, but the fruit ultimately wins out. The result is a very drinkable, silky textured wine with a long, toasty finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",95819
"99008","There's a lot of fruit to this New World Syrah. Cherry, cassis and berry aromas are fresh and forward, while in the mouth, this is full but not overly demanding or exact. Flavors of cherry and plum come with creamy oak notes of vanilla, while the finish is crisp in feel but generic in flavor.","Red","Syrah","Chile",99008
"76189","I continue to be impressed by how well even entry-level 2015 Sauvignons are developing. This one is understated and grapefruity, with hints of pea shoots and a silky feel. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",76189
"70306","There is a distinct tannic edge to this 100% Pinot Noir Champagne. It gives a firm character and with spice as well as red fruits and citrus. These elements, not quite integrated, show the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",70306
"29862","Salon's releases are rare and signify a great vintage—the last release was the 2002. Coming from grand cru vineyards in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this 2004 is complex and concentrated, capturing the essence of Chardonnay in Champagne. Intense minerality and ripe apple and citrus fruits accompany the purity and crisp texture that are part of its ability to age. The wine can continue for many years, certainly to 2025 and beyond.","White","Chardonnay","France",29862
"101902","This is a delicious and fruity wine from the smallest Beaujolais cru. There are tannins although they are lost in the generous cushion of ripe blackberry and black-cherry fruits. It is a smooth, rounded wine that is packed with fruit at the moment. Give it time and it will mature well. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",101902
"95280","Situated two miles north of the castle of Blaye, this estate has produced an obviously wood-aged, heavily extracted wine. At this stage, this wine is all tannins, smoky acidity and structure. It will always be concentrated with wood, although this will soften.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",95280
"53359","This is an attractive, lemon and lime-flavored wine. Riper yellow fruits also show through the crisp acidity and the lightly mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",53359
"58364","This soft wine has ripe melon and pear flavors only lightly cut with citrus acidity. It is easy to drink and ready now.","White","Chardonnay","France",58364
"100372","Grown in Green Valley, this medium-bodied wine offers heady Asian spices seasoned over tart, tangy orange and cherry. Pretty aromatics ride shotgun over a depth of earth and soft tannin and smoky oak, the wine ultimately plush and lush.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100372
"101731","Lightly wood aged, this wine is soft while still keeping some fruitiness. Spice and touches of toast are still integrating with the apple and lime flavors. The tangy, zesty aftertaste needs to calm down. Drink from late 2016.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",101731
"63794","A mostly neutral nose is devoid of fruit aromas and instead offers dusty notes of crushed rocks. This is a heavy rosé made from Garnacha, Syrah and Carignan. It's rather bitter and miserly in terms of fruit flavor, with a peppercorn finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",63794
"83012","Light in color, this good-deal wine presents lime sorbet and chalk on the nose. That green citrus persists on the palate alongside salt, sea shell and barrel smoke.","White","Chardonnay","US",83012
"70891","This Amarone has aromas of plum and evident oak. The palate delivers dark cherry, raisin and spice flavors, with chocolate and espresso accents. The dense fruit has easy appeal but the wine doesn't have much personality.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",70891
"760","Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",760
"62527","A deep straw color, this ready-to-drink Riesling is scented with wet rock, bee pollen, and ripe, yellow apples. Flavors are tart despite the 10 g/L residual sugar. It's fruity, flavorful and quite ready to drink up.","White","Riesling","US",62527
"40764","A lovely plum shade, this blends scents and flavors of pomegranate, cherry cola, Asian spice, black licorice and a dash of cacao. It's dense and penetrating, yet drinking well already. It spent nine months in 40% new French oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40764
"54366","Not a cookie-cutter wine, this tastes very alive and exuberant. It offers an aroma like fresh-baked scones, with very tangy flavors like orange and pineapple. That also makes it lively in texture, with lots of bright acidity derived from the grapes. Slightly nutty nuances develop on the finish, which is exceptionally long. It's a rare wine that has no added sulfites.","White","Chardonnay","US",54366
"46281","Ripe, lush and a touch raisiny on the nose, this smells like boysenberry pie and crème de cassis liqueur. Chewy, tannic and a bit heavy in this youthful state, this offering from vineyards in the town of Porrera (Vall Llach's home) delivers blackberry, cassis and prune flavors along with a toasty, chocolaty, oak-heavy finish. Best from 2016 through 2021.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",46281
"28953","Can Syrah get any richer than this wine? It has massive flavors of chocolate, licorice, blackberry pie, brown sugar, exotic spice and sandalwood that taste sweet yet finish dry and smooth. The tannins are so thick, you will need steak or lamb to wrestle them to the ground. Drink now–2016.","Red","Syrah","US",28953
"54416","This may be a wrong estimate, but the wine tastes like it was made from younger vines in this large vineyard. It has that fresh, rude, jammy quality that trades complexity and ageworthiness for immediate appeal. Yet there's no denying the luxurious balance, and the deliciousness of the cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54416
"84796","This wine's baking spice, vanilla and black-skinned berry aromas drift out of the glass. The straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, clove and tobacco flavors while rounded tannins lend easygoing support. Drink soon.","Red","Barbera","Italy",84796
"102542","Although this is from the Sonoma Coast appellation, it's high elevation, so the vineyard is often above the fog that plagues the lower Russian River Valley. As a result, the wine is quite ripe and forward in jammy raspberries, cherries, licorice and cola. New French oak adds the usual smoky, vanilla accents.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",102542
"76080","Pale in color, this is a drier than usual Rosé d'Anjou. It is fresh, soft with attractive wild strawberry fruits and a touch of orange peel. The wine has a tangy texture that makes it extra refreshing. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",76080
"104715","Low-intensity aromas of grilled apple, quince and pear purée dance on the bouquet, with a faint hint of straw in the background. Bright acidity and a pronounced citrus flavor results in a fresh and accessible mouthfeel, while the finish offers touches of toasted challah and clove. Drink now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",104715
"102349","Delicate and sheen, this briskly structured kabinett balances zesty lemon-lime flavors with subtle kisses of white peach and yellow-cherry flavors. Its invigorating mineral finish makes it an irresistible thirst quencher. Enjoy now through 2021.","White","Riesling","Germany",102349
"96632","The totally delicious fruit offers immense flavors of black cherries and cassis, along with streaks of cola, coffee and chocolate syrup. It's a luscious, beautifully balanced wine with a long and thoroughly delicious finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96632
"41656","Honeyed and slightly toasty on the nose, this has scents of baked apple, Bartlett pear and baguette. Light to medium bodied, the palate bears a broad white-fruit flavor with zesty acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",41656
"4823","Red fruit aromas show strongly in this wine. With its juicy acidity and soft tannins, it has fine fruitiness and will age quickly. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",4823
"1973","Made to drink young, this fruity, softly structured wine is ripe with blackberry fruits. There is a touch of spice from the wood aging and a lining of attractive acidity. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",1973
"9667","This light-bodied Pinot has some good raspberry and cherry pie flavors, as well as bright acidity. Decant to let it breathe, and drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9667
"85631","This is a new wine designed to be a “grown-up rosé” from the Cronk family who moved from London to Provence in 2009. It is a ripe fruity and rich blend of Grenache and Syrah. Weight as well as contrasting acidity give a structured character that balances well with the intense fruitiness. Drink the wine from late 2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",85631
"37760","Watermelon, strawberry and pie-cherry fruit flavors showcase a light and quite pretty rosé. Bone-dry despite the very low alcohol, it's backed with crisp acidity, a dash of minerality, and a finishing whiff of cocoa powder.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37760
"91891","Dark and toasty, this wild yeast fermented wine spent 10 months in 10% new Oregon oak. Slightly roasted flavors combine coffee grounds, chunky cherry and cassis. It's a full-bodied full-flavored wine which favors power over finesse.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91891
"28618","Fragrant hints of bergamot and Seville orange play enticingly on the nose of this beguiling wine. The palate amplifies those juicy, tart and lively flavors, sending them dancing into the finish. It's fresh, fruit-driven, dry and utterly moreish.","White","Riesling","Austria",28618
"25257","A rich and luscious wine that has sweet tannins, blackberry fruits and ripe tannins. It's a complex wine, elegant with full fruits, juicy acidity and a strong, firm textured core. Big and full-bodied, this is a wine that can age. It is drinkable now and until 2020.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",25257
"51408","Who puts their lowest-priced Pinot Noir in 20% new French oak, and includes fruit from their best vineyards in the blend? Ponzi does, and the result is a terrific vintage for Tavola. Bright, compact, aromatic and lushly fruited with plum and black cherry, this is a stunning value. Cola, caramel and cinnamon spice add further details and highlights.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51408
"92613","This widely ranging blend includes Bordeaux-style grapes, Tannat and Syrah. This wine is fruity, light as a feather and with the typical caramel underlay that comes from the Merlot in the blend. Red fruits and a crisp texture give this wine its attractive acidity. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",92613
"80937","A slam-dunk to have with tonight’s lasagna. It’s loaded with black fruit and spices, both on the nose and on the palate. Medium-bodied and well balanced, the finish is delightfully long.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",80937
"7569","A soft apple-tinged wine, with bright acidity that cuts right through. The wine is rounded, with just enough crispness. Ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",7569
"53163","Stewed prune, scorched earth, leather, menthol and leafy underbrush aromas set the tone. The ripe, jammy palate offers dried black cherry, clove and anise framed in densely packed, dusty tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unfold but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",53163
"55699","Partial barrel-fermentation shows in this wine's hints of vanilla and cream, which marry smoothly with grapefruit and melon fruit. The grapefruit shades toward pink, particularly on the pleasantly crisp finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",55699
"42426","This expression of Dolcetto is packed tight with loads of bright berry and black fruit aromas, but also has a polished mineral vein at the core. This is a lively, cheerful wine with good intensity, sour cherry flavors and firm tannins. Drink now.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",42426
"79300","This clean, simple and tasty sparkling wine is a Chardonnay/Pinot Noir cuvée, done in the traditional methode Champenoise. Pale straw in color, it brings flavors of green apple and pink grapefruit, with a clean finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",79300
"98595","Red rose, wild berry, toast, tobacco and a whiff of underbrush meld in the glass. On the firm palate, notes of clove, ground pepper, cinnamon, anise and mocha accent the red berry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins offer structure.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98595
"41276","Aromas of dark berry, clove, bell pepper and cedar take shape in the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, oak and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need time, the fruit is already starting to dry up.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",41276
"41352","The nose is concentrated and dark, with currant, plum and mocha driving the aromas. Fruit-driven on the palate, this Merlot- and Cabernet Franc-heavy blend is given structure from sandy, ripe tannins. A dusting of cracked pepper and stone linger on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",41352
"104017","Fresh, light, creamy Chardonnay, just a touch of vanilla with crisp, clean green fruits. There is an attractive touch of spice to round the wine off.","White","Chardonnay","France",104017
"41696","Rich and concentrated for an entry-level wine, with earthy, bold aromas and a lush, well-balanced palate feel. Deep and sweet in terms of flavor, with a mix of ripe black fruits and herbs. Shows a bit of faux oak flavor on a mocha-tinged finish. Exemplary for this price range.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",41696
"41861","With more than a quarter of million cases of this wine coming to the U.S., Nobilo's Regional Collection SB will turn up on a lot of tables over the summer—and justifiably so. It's a very good rendition of Marlborough Sauvignon, offering grassy aromas and flavors backed by lime and grapefruit. It's plump enough to have mass appeal, with a refreshingly crisp finish. Like almost all NZ Savvies, it should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",41861
"74596","Another successful Cabernet from Amici, who turns to this esteemed vineyard for sourcing. It shows real pedigree and finesse, and it's instantly appealing for its soft tannins and complex cherry, red currant, cocoa and spice flavors. Yes, it's expensive, but it's Amici's best Cabernet of the vintage, and this is as upscale as Napa Cabernet gets.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",74596
"64397","Sweet on the bouquet, with aromas of coffee, mocha, berry jam and cherry extract. Broad and saturated on the palate, with ripe blackberry, cassis and chocolaty flavors. Finishes smooth and easy, with ripe tannins. Very nice but ordinary as full-bodied, extracted Malbecs go.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",64397
"62885","Fully 25% of the wine is Syrah, which adds color and helps to bolster the fruit. Red berries provide a light base for a wine with plenty of barrel flavors of toast and coffee grounds.","Red","Grenache","US",62885
"43834","An elegant, lighter-style Pinot that oozes charm and finesse, from its vanilla-bean and cola aromas through the sweet root-vegetable and sour cherry flavors. Finishes well, with pretty herbal and fruit nuances that reverberate for a long time.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",43834
"39449","Fruity and floral on the nose, with plenty of sweet spice notes, balsam wood and depth. The palate on this five-grape, Syrah-led blend is full, with slightly edgy acidity that should allow it to age well. Shows core cassis, berry and plum flavors in front of a bullish finish with chocolate and vanilla.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",39449
"79150","The nose on this blend of Grenache, Carignan and other grapes burns and smells of iodine, mushroom, olive and rustic berry fruits. High acidity and an obtuse mouthfeel house salty, briny, minerally plum flavors, while the finish runs low on fruit.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",79150
"72176","A clean, well made wine displaying Cab Franc's herbaceous, earthy, and spicy-floral side.  Drinks on the lean side, with some spare, delicate berry fruit; it definitely needs food to bring out its best qualities.  Very dry.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",72176
"35586","This wine's rubbery latex, briary plum and berry aromas are potent. Its plum, berry and vanilla flavors finish with shrill acidity, hard, choppy tannins and long-lasting dark berry notes. Drink through 2028.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",35586
"12811","Modest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Spain",12811
"66785","Enticing aromas of wisteria and white spring flower rise from the glass on this fragrant sparkler. The crisp dry palate is more restrained, offering yellow apple and lemon zest alongside racy acidity and a vibrant perlage.","White","Glera","Italy",66785
"98002","This 100% Cabernet Franc bottling hails from Weinbau and Firethorn vineyards, both located in the Columbia Valley. It leads with bay leaf, tobacco, hickory, bittersweet chocolate and anise aromas. A palate that holds nothing back follows: big, bold dark fruit flavors supported by chewy tannins. An absolute delight.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",98002
"1892","An atypically light, delicate style of Riesling for the Pfalz, with lime and floral notes on the nose and a filigreed interplay of residual sugar and lithe acidity that lingers on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",1892
"73955","Tart, citrusy fruit flavors with some herbal overtones contrast with this wine's ample weight, while the finish is crisp and zesty. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Australia",73955
"19151","Ungainly, with stiff, puckery tannins giving a hard astringency, and unintegrated oak sticking out. Somewhere inbetween are modest cherry, anise and herb flavors. Pretty good, but not likely to go anywhere, so drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",19151
"96505","Concentrated cherry and strawberry flavors gain layers of complexity from lavish floral and brambly forest notes on this lovely Cab Franc. The palate is soft and a bit fleshy, but bright acidity adds balance and structure.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",96505
"20564","Always a knockout Brunello, Uccelliera's 2006 Riserva seems on the ripe side, with jammy fruit aromas and savory beef jerky notes at the back. The firmness and natural acidity associated with Sangiovese is present, but the aromas show hints of candied fruit and spicy plum cake.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",20564
"41847","Clean and proper, if a bit soft and simple. Shows modest cherry-berry flavors with a touch of oak.","Red","Merlot","US",41847
"68252","Brisk tobacco and red fruit aromas mesh with sanguine iron and cola notes on the nose of this appellation blend. The flavors are quite rusty, with fresh plum, sour cranberry and a bit of pencil lead.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",68252
"48318","With its typical perfumed fruit and firm tannins this is a ripe structured wine. It does suffer from the one-dimensional character that can come with a mono-varietal Touriga Nacional. That keeps the wine firm with good fruit although without great depth and complexity. Drink from 2017.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",48318
"49435","This is a light, bright wine with flavors of green fruits and citrus. There is a hint of yeastiness. Overall, a cool feeling wine that is ready to drink. Screwcap.","White","Pinot Blanc","Austria",49435
"65939","Ripe, jammy raspberry and blackberry aromas come with pastry notes and a strong blast of woodspice. This strapping wine has staunch tannins and hard-pushing acidity. Flavors of toast, blackberry and pepper lean toward the dark side, while the wine's handsome finish is secure in structure, balance and length. Drink through 2020.","Red","Mencía","Spain",65939
"103528","This brims with ripe, forward flavors of pineapples, golden mangos, honey and spicy pears, with vanilla and buttered toast notes despite being unoaked.","White","Chardonnay","US",103528
"38361","The wine's name (“last breath”) is based on its origins in vines planted next to a cemetery. Putting that aside, the wine itself is impressive, richly structured and with dense tannins and concentration. The wine with its firm character and ripe black fruit will age. Drink starting from 2019.","Red","Gamay","France",38361
"5506","Crushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton. The palate is silky, redolent with mulberry and tart plums skins, amped up by sagebrush and thyme. It's perfect for a variety of foods.","Red","Red Blend","US",5506
"7437","Here's a polished Pinot Grigio with character. It's loaded with creamy green apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine sensations accented with spicy notes of cinnamon and ginger that add depth. Crisp acidity generates freshness and it has a lingering finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",7437
"90123","A rich and rounded single-vineyard Chardonnay. It has weight and a smoky character to go with the peach, kiwi and lime juice flavors. The acidity is light, but does give a line of freshness.","White","Chardonnay","France",90123
"40423","Fresh on the nose, with red cherry and apple skin aromas. This feels rather sharp and acidic, with flavors of tart cherry pie and red plum.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",40423
"101606","From a selection of bunches that were left on the vines to gather noble rot, this wine is rich and wonderfully concentrated and with layers of botrytis and ripe fruits. Apricots and honey are balanced by the drier edge of the noble rot. It's a young wine still and will be even better from 2019.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",101606
"24031","The fruit is sourced from multiple vineyards across the appellation, including Eastside Estate, a vineyard formerly known as 3 Starrs recently purchased by the producer. Aromas of exotic plumeria provide an inviting entry, followed by a subtle, yet lightly rich expression of yellow apple and ample minerality. Everything combines for a balanced wine that's not overly heavy or overripe.","White","Chardonnay","US",24031
"21893","Always aromatic, here the scents of jasmine and honeysuckle are prelude to a dry, yeasty, lightly honeyed wine with lime, orange and golden delicious apple fruit. The penetrating finish carries notes of beeswax and fruit leather.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",21893
"101456","Vanilla salt-water taffy and melted butter are undercut with lime juice on the nose of this wine. Once sipped, it has a slightly waxy mouthfeel along with flavors of dried apples and underripe lime rinds, giving a slightly sour character.","White","Chardonnay","US",101456
"18246","The aromatics suggest rose petals, while the tart fruit flavors run to raspberries and citrus. The freshness and complexity hint at further improvement over the next three to five years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18246
"3634","Whiffs of sea breeze and oyster shells waft throughout this brisk unoaked Chardonnay. Crisp apple and lemon flavors are delicate in concentration but pristine and refreshing. Drink now through 2019.","White","Chardonnay","US",3634
"55324","Vanilla, spice and citrus aromas start this dependable Greek Chardonnay. Spicy citrus, vanilla, fresh white fruit and flowers on the palate are balanced and easy to love. Pair with richer seafood or salads.","White","Chardonnay","Greece",55324
"28350","Lightly charred and oaky on first take, this traditional Rioja features vanilla scents on top of red plum and raspberry aromas. A juicy, fresh, tight palate tastes of old-school American oak blended with plum, raspberry and woodspice. A dry, juicy, peppery finish is fitting for this wine. Drink through 2021.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",28350
"18184","From a head-trained, dry-farmed vineyard, this very delicate and rather light bottling shows minerally lava rock and riverstone aromas, tart red-cherry fruit and a touch of chaparral. The palate's light structure offers rust and red cherry flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",18184
"3798","Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes. The palate is plush and rich with flavors evocative of earl grey tea served with rose petal jam, with a gentle acidity to keep things fresh.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",3798
"32014","Fresh tangerine and lemon aromas turn a shade riper on the palate of this approachable but elegant dry Riesling. It's luscious and mouthfilling, brightened by tart lime and grapefruit acidity that extends through a long finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",32014
"76811","Heavy white-fruit aromas manage to stay fresh, while in the mouth this is ripe and chunky. Flavors suggest melon, creamy oak and banana. The finish is warm and sticky.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",76811
"20189","Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.","White","Riesling","France",20189
"47326","The Shea vineyard is still recovering from extensive post-phylloxera replanting, and many of the wines produced from its fruit seem much lighter than in the past. Here, however it compensates, at least partially, with a graceful, elegant composition. The mix of red fruits, mineral and light spring herbs is perfectly set against polished tannins. I would expect this wine to add texture and complexity over the next decade or more.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47326
"71539","Revancha is a new line of wines from esteemed winemaker Roberto de la Mota. This blends Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc. On the nose, it is spicy, lightly herbal and deep in fruit. A tight palate shows raw tannins and flavors of wild berry and oak-based coconut. Dry, flashy and a bit rough on the finish, this will benefit from a few more years in bottle. Drink through 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Argentina",71539
"43936","Lovely aromatics push scents of espresso, cassis, truffle and baker's chocolate right up front. The wine is polished, fine-boned and balanced, with taut cranberry and raspberry fruit. It brings in subtle accents of chalk, earth, rock and lead pencil, building to a firm, beautifully structured finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",43936
"29823","The aromas of ripe peach, honeysuckle and jasmine are bright. It's medium sweet and finishes with a floral soap flourish. It needs more acid to stand it up but goes down easy.","White","Riesling","US",29823
"61742","A very rich Pinot Noir, this tastes almost as heavy as pie filling. It's delicious, tasting of brown sugar, ripe black cherry and pie spice, with a buttery toast note from oak barrels. It's a little soft, so drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",61742
"79764","Aromas of blue flower, spiced plum, ripe berry and leather take shape in the glass. The delicious palate delivers layers of crushed black cherry, licorice, clove and grilled herb alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's both structured and elegant. Drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",79764
"77130","While redolent of jasmine blossoms and sweet orange marmalade, Hosmer's dry Riesling is surprisingly austere on the palate with hints of fresh fennel fronds and a gripping lemon acidity. A good match for heavier, savory fare like braised pork belly, it finishes on a pleasantly bitter citrus-pith note.","White","Riesling","US",77130
"85228","Intense and high in acidity, this wine skirts the edge of ripeness in its salty, briny take on the variety, a nod to an historic clone. Floral, it persists in apple blossom and tart Meyer lemon, finishing crisp and fresh.","White","Chardonnay","US",85228
"27610","Made in a familiar style for those who enjoy easy and fresh Pinot Grigio, Borgo Crosaris is appropriate for informal summer lunches on the patio. Citrus, peach and cut grass are the most obvious aromatic elements.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",27610
"106442","There's a stunning amount of action on the nose of this bottling by Josh Jensen, with dried jasmine, lemon curd, squeezed tangerine, key lime pie and a warm touch of nuttiness. Rounded stonefruit and apple blossoms show on the palate, which is bound by a grapefruit pith grip and features a steadily growing salty character that comes on smooth and strong. A botanical twist hits the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",106442
"59544","Tobacco, cassis and vanilla notes bring the aromas and flavors, while the wine's firm structure gives a medium-weight feel and dusty texture. Drink now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",59544
"31580","Plump, ripe notes of blackberry jam, prune, spice cake, tobacco and black tea steal the show and make for a very prominent, sweet and intense nose. The mouthfeel is less bulky but it does offer the length you should expect.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",31580
"44793","A good Merlot, although not without some problems. It's dry and silky, with soft tannins framing currant, violet and cedar flavors. However, there's a stubbornly green, minty streak that limits ageability.","Red","Merlot","US",44793
"47108","Earthy, dusty mineral tones on the nose fade to reveal juicy grapefruit and red apple on the palate of this approachable off-dry Riesling. Bright, lemony acidity lends vitality to a moderately long finish.","White","Riesling","US",47108
"64736","Made with Sangiovese and Merlot, this soft, fruity wine offers juicy black cherry, raspberry and the faintest hint of baking spice. It's easy-drinking and accessible, thanks to fresh acidity and round tannins. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",64736
"63732","Cool, mineral elegance and pristine tangerine and quince flavors mark this zesty, sylphlike Riesling. It's dry and light bodied with a finish highlighted by lemony acidity. Drink now through 2019.","White","Riesling","Germany",63732
"102597","A heavy, extracted Pinot Noir, with baked cherry and blackberry flavors and lots of new oak. Dry, but feels a little tired. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",102597
"14155","It's rare in Burgundy that a producer can add his name to a vineyard, but Faiveley's tradition goes back at least a century. This is huge and dense; the notes of spice, sweet black plum and acidity are all comfortably balanced with the powerful tannic structure. This needs at least seven years of aging.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",14155
"75348","A forward, fruity wine, full of apple and creamed pear flavors. The acidity is light, bright and attractive giving a wine that is fresh and ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",75348
"68069","There's a concentrated core of ripe black cherry and plum here, but the focus of this wine seems focused on its earthier, more savory elements of mineral, moss and wood. Rustic yet elegant, it's a neatly composed wine with sprightly acidity and a bold yet balanced body.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",68069
"12781","Blue flower, wild rose, perfumed berry and a balsamic note waft from the glass. Structured but graceful, the vibrant palate weaves together crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, licorice and cinnamon alongside firm but polished tannins. Tempting now but hold for complexity. Drink 2018–2030.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",12781
"54404","One of the sweetest California dessert wines out there, and all that honey goes a long way to make it likeable. The apricot, pear, pineapple and vanilla bean flavors taste like something from Starbucks, but could be a bit more concentrated. Still, it's certainly a decadent wine that will satisfy your sweet tooth.","White","Viognier","US",54404
"46821","From the estate vineyard, this is thick with spicy flavors of fresh-cut pear. There's a hint of butter and a slightly minty aspect. All in all it's complex, rich and inviting, with penetrating acidity.","White","Pinot Gris","US",46821
"53321","This medium-bodied, small-production red was given a light touch of oak, only 25% of it new and French, allowing the other characteristics to speak louder than the wood. Compact tannins support a juicy, youthfully grippy frame of pomegranate and orange that opens further in the glass.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53321
"31543","With an abundance of deep black-cherry, molasses and leather aromas, this is dynamite in terms of intensity and concentration. In the mouth, it's smooth and stylish, with a tight black-fruit core and a suave finish. Built like a house with a very dark interior; it'll be alive and kicking through 2008.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",31543
"27000","The closed nose leads onto a compact palate that mixed red cherry notes with sandalwood oak spice. This is elegant and evolves beautifully in the glass. It will sing with earthy mushroom dishes.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",27000
"90696","This is tart and steely, with a flavor of pear skin rather than pear flesh, along with a green apple note and a whiff of grapefruit. Sharply acidic, it's a wine that should pair well with spicy Asian cuisine.","White","Pinot Gris","US",90696
"19470","Petite Verdot is a hard variety to succeed on its own, but Calcareous has produced a fine, dry wine made from that Bordeaux variety. It's full-bodied and complex, with flavors of currants, mushu plum sauce, violets, dark chocolate and anise. Such are the tannins that the wine should develop through 2010.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",19470
"76020","At 1,200 feet, the Underwood Mountain vineyard brings a certain illumination and transparency to the Riesling grape. It's a style both elegant and intense, and nowhere else in Washington state except the Columbia Gorge does Riesling achieve this sort of delicate power. Scents and flavors of blossom, citrus and stone fruits combine in a gorgeous display. It's bright, lip-smacking and beautifully balanced.","White","Riesling","US",76020
"58641","Here's a Pinot Grigio with structure and personality, proving why Friuli is Italy's white wine capital. It's loaded with creamy green apple and pear sensations uplifted by energizing mineral notes. The finish is crisp and clean.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",58641
"81878","A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (36%) and Petit Verdot from the Seven Hills and Loess vineyards, aromas of dried high-toned herb, cocoa and barrel spice intermingle on a wine that has yet to fully reveal its charms. The palate offers cranberry and dark-cherry flavors that create an exquisite sense of freshness and balance.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",81878
"70075","Acidity and hard tannins dominate this bone dry Bordeaux blend, locking it down into bitterness and astringency. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's also very oaky. This is not offering much pleasure now, but will it age? Judging from the overall balance, as well as the intensity of black currants, the answer is yes. Hang onto it until 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",70075
"104227","The Naked (organically grown) series from Snoqualmie continues to expand, now with this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It feels soft and manipulated in the mouth; there is a hole in it. Despite the black cherry and smoke flavors, it feels insubstantial and incomplete.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",104227
"78675","With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a strongly structured wine. It is dark and tannic, acidity laced with dark plum flavors. This firm wine is still young and should be aged for at least a year, so drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",78675
"84100","While the nose suggests a hint of pressed apple, the palate on this richly textured Chardonnay is bright with yellow plum and apple flavors touched with spice, smoke and cream. Revitalizing acidity freshens the midpalate, leaving the finish brisk and clean.","White","Chardonnay","US",84100
"96205","A mild whiff of gasoline is typical for Riesling, while this also smells a touch cheesy but not funky. A straight-ahead lemony palate delivers short blasts of lemon and underripe nectarine flavors, while the finish is mostly fresh and focused.","White","Riesling","Chile",96205
"24112","Spicy, earthy cherry and cassis aromas are true to the variety. This is juicy, bright and substantive in feel, with red berry, oak spice and herbal flavors. A minty, chocolaty finish full of herbs and spices provides for a good ending.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",24112
"100738","Ripe plum, maraschino, moist tobacco, Indian spice and used leather are components of the complex bouquet. It shows great intensity and power; the mouthfeel is smooth, rich and opulent. Try pairing it with rib-eye steaks and baked black beans.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",100738
"17150","This wine shows beautiful results with a darkly concentrated appearance and bright aromas of prune, leather and tobacco. The wine is balanced and crisp, with lingering red cherry and chocolate flavors, but ultimately the purity of wine puts it slightly ahead of this estates's other vineyard-designate Brunello.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",17150
"61568","Tropical fruit and melon aromas are basic but friendly. This has a punch-like mouthfeel as well as open-knit flavors of orange, nectarine, white grapefruit and apple. What it lacks in finesse is made up for in fruit.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",61568
"43302","Expansive body and a undulating, textural palate set this dry Riesling apart. The palate is juicy yet elegant, full of ripe, concentrated white grapefruit and lime flavors. Fresh yet powerful, it finishes on lingering notes of earth and smoke. Drink now through 2030.","White","Riesling","Germany",43302
"2450","This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",2450
"12256","Unconventional but outstanding, this wine is an earthy throwback to an earlier era, from its light, brownish color to its dried leaf, rhubarb and wet earth aromas to its lean but complex red cherry, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Wild yeast and wild bacteria were used for the primary and malolactic fermentations, respectively.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12256
"59557","Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this opens with scents of blue flower, rose, perfumed berry and a hint of dark spice. The bright palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside tightly wound but remarkably refined tannins. Drink 2017–2022.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",59557
"32597","This is as good a Pinot Gris as this producer has ever made. Apples and stone fruits contribute a fleshy, flavorful mid-palate. Peppery spice and a hint of brioche add complexity and interest. The wine is perfectly balanced and ready to drink immediately.","White","Pinot Gris","US",32597
"890","All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvée. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.","White","Riesling","US",890
"70056","A rich and perfumed wine that brings out the violet aromas and juicy black currant fruits of the Touriga Nacional. It is rich, structured with a tannic dryness that is well balanced with the juicy, ripe black fruits. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",70056
"27901","Basic melon and peach aromas become more pungent and citrusy with airing. The palate has weight and zest but lacks complexity, while the flavors are citrusy and green, much like Sauvignon Blanc, which is common for this wine based on past performance.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",27901
"50465","Concentrated, potent aromas of earthy blackberry and cassis bring notes of briar patch, prune and exotic spices. The palate is full and oaky but fresh, with flavors of berry, cassis, herb and wood grain. A heavy finish with overt oak and related spice is modern in style. Drink through 2017.","Red","Mencía","Spain",50465
"85882","This 50-50 blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese has blackberry, blue flower and spice aromas that carry on to the palate, along with black cherry and astringent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's also shy on freshness, so drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",85882
"10459","In Pinot Noir, you get what you pay for. Granted, MaManis's 2010 is a pretty simple wine. But it is classic in the silky structure and pleasant raspberry and cherry flavors, touched with smoky oak, and is one of the better Pinots at this price.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",10459
"68440","Subtle aromas of violet and red berry lead the way on this simple red. The lively palate shows sour cherry and a sprinkling of clove alongside brisk acidity and pliant tannins. Drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",68440
"30377","This is turning into a ripe and fruity wine. The tannins are integrating easily into the black currant flavors. Soon the dry core will open out, supporting the fruit taste. The blend is 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. Drink from late 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",30377
"45024","Made from Petite Sirah, Tempranillo and Tannat, this beautiy illustrates the type of blended red wine that is putting Paso Robles on the map. It's filled with cherry pie, cola and mushroom flavors that combine rich fruit with a subtle earthiness. Don't bother to age this wine, just drink it now with mushroom risotto or a rich lamb ragout.","Red","Red Blend","US",45024
"66563","Both elegant and refreshing, this citrus and floral-infused wine follows the Navarro house style for whites, which includes great balance, rounded mouthfeel and honey and floral accents. It's medium bodied, vibrant with acidity and wonderfully complex.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",66563
"56333","Minty and sheer on the nose, and that's a prime indicator of what's to come, namely high-toned, lean fruit flavors and an abundance of scouring, protruding acidity. Some oak lingers to soften things, but overall this is a sharp, underdeveloped style of Cabernet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",56333
"68473","Aromas of toasted oak, mocha and a whiff of coconut oak lead the nose while the firm palate offers dark cherry, espresso, dried sage and a hint of anise. The tightly wound tannins still pack youthful sharpness and need a few more years to soften up. Drink after 2021.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",68473
"71936","Dainty scents of fresh hay, pressed yellow flower, orange rind and ginger frame the stone-fruit core of this wine. Flavors of white tea, spiced orange and peach flood the palate, and while the texture is somewhat round and plush, ample acidity keeps the finish fresh and clean. Drink now.","White","Viognier","South Africa",71936
"80811","Lengthy in soft tannins, clove and cinnamon, this wine has a handful of Petit Verdot. An herbal underbrush hints at an elegant backbone, despite the huge force of power and weight. It finishes in a flourish of lavender and black licorice.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80811
"62856","Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 35% of this blend, along with 26% Syrah, 26% Merlot, and 13% Cabernet Franc. Aged in 70% new French and American oak, barrel-forward aromas of vanilla, coconut and baking spice are out in front of a medley of dark fruit. The fruit flavors are sweet, rich and luscious, with toothsome tannins providing support. There's plenty of enjoyment to be had but the barrel influence is pretty intense.","Red","Red Blend","US",62856
"27243","New leather, menthol, ripe berry and Asian spice aromas emerge in the glass while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, star anise and a hint of game. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage. Assertive, close-grained tannins squeeze the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",27243
"86782","A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has an earthy-berry aroma, with a hint of floral-based perfume. It offers acidity and solidity on the palate, which is backed by standard black-fruit flavors, with undertones of vanilla and raw oak. Very good, but it's a bit oaky.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",86782
"94353","From old vines and only produced in top vintages, this ripe perfumed wine is impressive. Rich with tropical fruits, layers of vanilla and acidity, it is full, up-front and packed with concentrated flavors and textures. Like many wines from this appellation, it can age and will be better from 2019.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",94353
"75577","Dark and dense, with prune-like aromas. It's powerful and forward, with fudge, plum and blackberry flavors on a full, mildly tannic frame. Finishes with clamp-down bite and flavors of burnt toast and chocolate. Could stand to show more character and less generic black fruit.","Red","Malbec","Chile",75577
"91730","This is a good vineyard and it's a decent wine but not a great one. It's overripe, as shown by the raisiny flavors and a certain peppery heat. But it will be fine with a big barbecued chunk of beef.","Red","Syrah","US",91730
"32177","One of the finest wines to come out of Cahors, this is so stylish. Of course, it has power, intense fruit and acidity. At the same time, balanced richness allied to solid tannins and ripe black fruits single it out. It needs considerable aging to soften the tannins that are still so exuberant. Drink from 2018.","Red","Malbec","France",32177
"104042","A blend of fruit drawn from the Awatere and Brancott subregions, this is a lively, fresh example of Marlborough Pinot Noir. Judiciously applied notes of vanilla and cinnamon accent flavors of cherry and herb that finish long, while the medium- to full-bodied wine's tannins are ripe and impart a creamy texture. Drink now and over the next couple of years.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",104042
"32625","Vines with an average age of 35 years have produced this smooth, creamy wine. A light mineral character shows in a flinty texture, balanced by ripe white stone fruits and pink grapefruit. A touch of pepper comes through in the aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",32625
"90315","A big, rich, full-bodied wine that's kind of like Syrah, but with different flavors. There's a warm, baked pie filling taste of black and red cherries, currants, coconut macaroons, licorice, chocolate and violets, and the finish is very long and richly spicy. At its best now and for a couple more years.","Red","Grenache","US",90315
"103948","Earthy aromas of game, porcini mushroom, scorched earth, saline and crushed herb meld together on this. The taut palate offers raw red berry, mineral and grilled sage alongside austere tannins. Drink 2018–2023.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",103948
"55849","This wine plays to the variety's savory side, with aromas of smoke, raw meat and generous amounts of black pepper. It's full bodied, with mesquite and spice flavors that linger.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",55849
"29039","One of Italy's most iconic bottlings, the 2012 Sassicaia is drop-dead gorgeous. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, it boasts sensations of blue flowers, cedar, juicy red currants, ripe raspberries, white pepper and a balsamic note. Structured, radiant and loaded with finesse, it delivers everything you'd expect from a world-class wine and more. Drink 2018–2032.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",29039
"6725","Aromas of lemon-lime, jasmine and honeysuckle prepare the palate for crisp, clean flavors of lemon zest and lemon curd.","White","Riesling","Bulgaria",6725
"2550","This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now–2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",2550
"28154","Shows all the beautiful Viognier notes you could ask for: flowers, spice, apricot and melon, carried by a succulent mouthfeel that remains fresh and vibrant from start to lingeringly spicy finish. Drink now.","White","Viognier","Australia",28154
"61681","This perfumed, spicy wine has crisp red fruit and acidity. Light and with a soft aftertaste, it's attractive and ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",61681
"3834","Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty.","Red","Syrah","US",3834
"33790","Sweet strawberry and cherry fruits are the soft cover to this intensely tannic wine. That structure shows its power, concentration and ageworthiness. Keep for three years and the richness will be fully revealed.","Red","Gamay","France",33790
"84107","This blend of Grenache (63%), Tempranillo (25%) and Syrah offers barrel notes of fresh brewed coffee, woodspice and vanilla bean along with red and blue fruit. It's silky-soft with a creamy feel backed by grainy tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",84107
"101779","Inky oaky aromas of graphite and black fruits introduce a palate that's supremely saturated. Flavors of roasted plum and blackberry are savory and meaty, while this feels lush on the finish but also strapping and sinewy. Dos Mundos purports to represent both Portugal and Argentina, but this is all Argentina in character. Drink through 2023.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",101779
"11712","High alcohol lends an uncomfortable heat to this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Viognier. Raspberry and cherry flavors are brightened by citrusy acidity. It's ready to drink now.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",11712
"104331","Complex and precise, this lovely Cabernet—blended with 10% Merlot and 3% Malbec—layers cassis, herb, bark, earth and graphite elements within a cigar box coating. Those streaks of tobacco are wedded to a touch of espresso as it weaves through a lingering finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",104331
"13503","This chewy, dense and dark Syrah softly intrigues with black fruit and gamy notes. Given 20 months in new and used French oak, it's structured and ageable through 2020, a substantial wine with a sense of elegance around the edges.","Red","Syrah","US",13503
"8976","Smooth blackberry, chocolate, violet and raisin aromas make for a complete nose. A saturated, ripe palate is a touch heavy, while heady flavors of licorice, black peppercorn and blackberry are slightly charred on a flush finish. Drink through 2022.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",8976
"91623","This is a medium-bodied, silky rendering of Pinot Noir. Restrained aromas of cherries, dried herbs and vanilla lead into similar flavors, then pick up a touch of mocha on the long finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",91623
"35838","Pretty standard in terms of flavor profile, but well-executed, marrying toasty, pain grille aromas with flavors of vanilla, ripe pears and melon. Medium- to full-bodied, it finishes with a flourish of oak and spice.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",35838
"2613","At only $12 per bottle, this is a solid value. The aromas are slightly dusty, like dried rose petal, while the flavors suggest mixed berries and dry earth, with a hint of black tea on the finish. Tannins are silky. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",2613
"96756","Like a well-made café latte, this wine balances the dry and restrained elements against creamy, mocha nuances that round out the texture and bring an almost sweet, jammy taste to the finish. Just substitute rich blackberry for coffee flavors to make the analogy work.","Red","Zinfandel","US",96756
"67365","An unabashedly rich and luscious wine, this combines ripe and fresh fruit flavors with luxurious spicy, buttery accents and an almost thick texture. With a subtext as savory as Udon broth it's practically a meal in a bottle. Call it full-bodied, full-flavored, ultrasmooth and impressive.","White","Chardonnay","US",67365
"25678","These are in fact the original Pinot Noir vines planted in the Willamette Valley, back in the mid-1960s. An explosion of sensory detail quickly opens up the wine, with pollen, sandalwood, sassafras and coffee grounds. Those flavors wrap around blackberry, licorice and cola, continuing to expand and explore the far reaches of the palate. Phylloxera may soon eliminate these vines, so don't wait to acquire a bit of history in a bottle.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25678
"94705","This may be one of the most austere Viogniers I've ever found from Washington; it's bone dry and just a bit over 13% alcohol. That makes it a good and versatile wine for mealtime. It's light, hints at beeswax and citrus, with a soft mouthfeel and a curious mix of toasted almond, banana andbutter cookies in the finish.","White","Viognier","US",94705
"68907","Here is a playful Riesling with a nice balance between sweet fruit and drying mineral tones that give the wine dimension and intensity. Aromas include stone fruit, white flower and natural rubber.","White","Riesling","Italy",68907
"31430","Hints of asparagus and struck flint give an almost Sancerre-like impression before heading in a lemony direction. This lean, citrusy wine offers good value, but consumers should be looking out for stocks of the 2015, a better vintage that should be arriving soon.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",31430
"65503","This barrel selection evokes the AVA's black-cherry fruit character nicely, keeping it lively and balanced, with excellent depth. Tasting the wine is like gazing into a deep pool; the flavors keep pushing further into the finish. Streaks of coffee and milk chocolate are in the mix, but it's the excellent fruit that captures your attention and holds it.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",65503
"6836","Generously ripe notions of yellow plum and juicy pear fill the nose. The palate benefits from the same fruitfulness but adds a touch of pepper and herbal savor at its concentrated core. There is something joyful about this. Despite the generous fruit this stays streamlined and supercrisp. The finish focuses on that wonderfully spicy pepperiness.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",6836
"93855","This is and properly dry, with smooth tannins and high acidity that lends some sting to the palate. The berry and earth flavors lack some intensity. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93855
"9195","From vines owned by the Chanson family, this is a wonderfully rich wine, deliciously fruity at the same time. Apple and citrus as well as richer apricots come through powerfully. It's structured with a sense of opulence, richness that also has a tight texture. It needs to age; drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",9195
"4588","Pinot Bianco is a fantastic food wine that delivers good density and natural creaminess without being too fragrant or perfumed. This beautiful expression delivers the best that this grape variety awards in an exceedingly crisp and clean package.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",4588
"90951","Ripe tropical fruits permeate this ready-to-drink wine. Pineapple and mango flavors have just enough acidity to keep this generous wine crisp. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",90951
"3904","From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines.","White","Chardonnay","US",3904
"92453","This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is light in color and offers aromas such as old leather, pipe tobacco, prune and chopped herbs with a slightly dirty, earthy quality. Yet it's lively in the mouth, with tight tannins, fresh acidity and bright cherry flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",92453
"64517","This medium-bodied red opens with aromas of red berry, tilled earth, underbrush and dried herb. The firm palate doles out black cherry, plum, licorice and crushed mint alongside modest acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",64517
"74723","Freshly baked bread, toasted hazelnut, yellow apple, ginger, subtle oak and vanilla are some of the sensations conveyed by this sophisticated sparkler. Made from 100% Chardonnay, it boasts a remarkably refined mousse and bright acidity. It also has great length and a crisp, dry finish.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",74723
"104059","Hats off to the Mazzei brothers for crafting this rich, pleasurable wine that mirrors the sunny warmth and softness of the region. The unusual blend is Sangiovese and Alicante, and it's redolent of lively red cherries, tobacco and chocolate fudge.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",104059
"33756","Calm, foresty, complex and inviting on the bouquet, with catchy berry and spice aromas. It's round, balanced and healthy in the mouth, with cola, dried herb, cassis and blackberry flavors. Chocolaty and oaky on the finish, but dry and proper. Almost identical to Qaramy's basic blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",33756
"5821","Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach.","White","Chardonnay","US",5821
"43262","It's not easy distinguishing one Emiliana Chardonnay from the other; they're all more or less similar. Novas shows a touch of match stick and aromatic harshness, which is offset by softer melon and peach aromas. The palate is full and pulpy, with melony, obtuse flavors. Good for Chile, and decidedly not bitter or pithy","White","Chardonnay","Chile",43262
"24300","Pungent, feline aromas of sweat and cactus set up a sharp, citric palate that's loaded to the brim with acidity. Austere flavors of passion fruit and lime end with a note of mango along with a wave of citric burn.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Spain",24300
"49865","Oxidized and mute, with mushy, nutty flavors and a similar finish. An underperformer that lacks freshness, purity and character.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",49865
"85994","Shows nice complexity in its aromas of cherry, vanilla, soy sauce, leather and meat, then fills the mouth with supple cherry fruit that carries a hints of medicinal herbs. Finishes with tart cherries and a slight lactic note. —J.C.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",85994
"80653","This fluorescent pink rosé is fairly full on the nose, with a grape skins character. Lively, balanced and lightly oily in feel, this delivers plum and citrus flavors prior to a finish that's pithy and tastes like ripe pink grapefruit.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",80653
"22704","Fermented in all new French oak, this wine opens with an enchanting nose of floral beauty and freshness. Its sophistication follows through on the rich, balanced palate of caramel, papaya and crème brûlée, the lushness countered by a stony grit.","White","Chardonnay","US",22704
"96463","Another nice effort from McGrail, a Cab from their estate vineyards that shows dark plum, vanilla and tobacco and a soft roundness, all around its tannins crying out for red meat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96463
"86979","Dark berry and meaty fruit on the nose, with plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is zestier, with bright acidity tempering any weight. The finish is solid, with nothing off or outlandish to consider. A good, solid, concentrated Syrah without a whole lot of varietal character.","Red","Syrah","Argentina",86979
"64249","An impressive, rich, creamy, oak-aged Chardonnay that has already developed secondary flavors of almonds and pine nuts. The balance, though, is well preserved; a full, flavorful wine edged with toast and finishing with the fruit acidity. It could well develop over the next 2–3 years.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",64249
"38285","This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. ItÕs vibrant and juicy, like Beaujolais. The gorgeous ripeness of the fruit bodes well for the 2001 vintage. Great value.","Red","Red Blend","US",38285
"75881","Bursts with bright, linear cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, but it's not caustic, sharp or grating. Acidity at peak power yields a zesty, racy personality while a blanket of vanilla flavor softens the cherry and raspberry fruit. Crisp and a good food wine.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",75881
"47356","Earthy and soft, this structured, medium-bodied wine is elusive in fruit, playing its hand with shy suggestions of cranberry and raspberry underneath integrated tannins and subtle oak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",47356
"49130","Ripe black-skinned fruit, underbrush, truffle and dark spice aromas come together in this full-bodied red. The palate is firm and seamless, delivering mature black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and pipe tobacco flavors with both power and finesse. Tightly knit, polished tannins provide structure. Drink 2022–2032.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",49130
"20209","Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",20209
"34503","A rusty color and stewy aromas of murky berry fruits and cardamom set this off on its own course. Choppy and chunky in feel, this Garnacha tastes stewed, savory and baked, with almost no fruit to speak of. On the finish, this seems roasted.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",34503
"90796","With half the blend Chardonnay, this has a crisp and steely character. It also has richness and the first signs of maturity. It is full in the mouth, an elegant Champagne that would be good to drink now, but will also develop further.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",90796
"94179","This wine is serious in style, from the deep, dark color to the tempting touch of oak in the aroma to the plump but tangy fruit flavors. Its full body and nicely tannic texture gives it some grip on the palate.","Red","Malbec","US",94179
"75713","It is a dark and earthy Pinot, with notes of clean compost, root beer and faint hints of campfire. This medium- to full-bodied wine boasts supple tannins that coast easily through a long, silky finish. Tasted from a 3L bottle in Central Otago (nonblind), the wine seemed much fresher, with more cherry fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",75713
"3813","New leather, pressed rose, violet, baking spice and crushed herb are just some of the aromas you'll find in this textbook Barolo. Firm yet loaded with finesse, the palate offers red cherry, strawberry compote, cinnamon and clove notes set against a backdrop of youthfully austere tannins and bright acidity. A licorice note lingers on the finish. Give it time to fully bloom. Drink 2023–2033.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",3813
"27168","As always, the historic winery produces a nuanced, restrained style, with a subdued nose of berries and balsamic reduction. It's light and bright on the palate, with chicory and woody tones and medium-ripe cherry fruit, a perfect partner to varied foods.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",27168
"59645","Plum and red-berry aromas are clean and fresh. This skips along on the palate, while flavors of wild berry and plum are a touch raw in character and feel. A rubbery finish is fresh and turns mildly bitter once the fruit fades.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",59645
"5200","One of the denomination's benchmark bottlings, this fresh yet creamy off-dry sparkler opens with alluring scents of apple, exotic fruit and white peach that carry over to the silky palate along with candied citrus zest. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and creates a refreshing finish.","White","Glera","Italy",5200
"10038","Tight and tannic, this wine is still young. The stalky fruit is cut with intense acidity coming from the crisp black currant flavors. It's a wine that needs some aging although it will probably remain dry and stalky. Drink from 2016.","Red","Red Blend","France",10038
"23182","A fairly rich take on this grape, which many wineries use from this particular vineyard, this bottling is flush with white peach and white melon aromas, cut by lime and dried lemon blossoms, and layered with intriguing kiwi and exotic citrus notes. The palate is more simple, with apple and lemon flavors and chalky texture.","White","Chenin Blanc","US",23182
"50876","This wine is powerful and full bodied, from the cocoa and raspberry-syrup aromas to the potent blackberry and Port-like flavors. It needs to pair with some aged cheese or a juicy cut of beef.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",50876
"9697","The palest color leads to a perfumed, very ready-to-drink wine. It is crisp with fruit that is now softened by a year's aging, offering a touch of caramel along with crushed strawberry flavors. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",9697
"23565","There are still some rough edges here: hints of volatility, burnt wood notes and unintegrated barrel flavors. But there is substantial red fruit at the core, and it's got plenty of punch and power to stand up to a smoky barbequed meal.","Red","Tempranillo","US",23565
"11256","This starts with dense, murky, earthy aromas of stewed black fruits and rubber. In the mouth, it feels full and aggressive, with rubbery tannins supporting thick, herbal flavors of rooty black fruits. A chunky, chewy, layered finish is generous in every way.","Red","Syrah","Chile",11256
"38559","The price on this wine is laughable, but the quality is excellent. Earthy aromas of lead pencil, baked plum, cassis and black cherry include chocolate and minerality. The palate is rich, jammy and a touch stewy, with herbal blackberry, cassis, chocoalte and coffee flavors. Even more chocolate and licorice rise up on the long finish. Put this away until 2015, then drink through 2024.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",38559
"83194","Tastes like it comes from Edna Valley, with its dryness, great burst of juicy acidity and jammy Mandarin orange, lime, kiwi and Meyer lemon flavors. Great with crab cakes dressed in a mango salsa.","White","Chardonnay","US",83194
"64776","Forceful from the opening, with floral notes, dark oak, shoe polish and char vying with black fruit aromas. Feels both lush and tough, with hard tannins poking through. Tastes of black fruits, cola and heavily toasted oak. Bittersweet on the finish; lusty and black but neither elegant nor light on its feet.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",64776
"53180","Snappy, prickly, red-currant aromas fail to improve with airing. The palate is high in acidity, creating a sheer feel to the cherry and raspberry fruit that drives the flavor profile. Drying and hollow on the finish. Very regular wine, with bramble and tartness.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",53180
"36234","This bold, densely flavored and impressively tannic wine is dry, very well structured and will be interesting to age until 2018–2019. It smells darkly fruity, smoky and spicy, and tastes like cranberry and black cherry, finishing with a firm tang of tannin. It will be best after 2018.","Red","Red Blend","US",36234
"83729","To say the least, it comes out guns blazing and oozing mountain character. Animal and barnyard, coffee and earth, even burnt toast and smoky bacon are all over this wine. Fruit definitely plays second fiddle to the dark, earthy essence of this Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc trio.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",83729
"26621","Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Spain",26621
"43999","Toasty oak is wrapped around some complex elements: blackberry, violets, tar, cedar, coffee and game. Big, very dark fruit, tobacco and toast flavors soar, and the mouthfeel is intense yet not weighty. Fine structure on the finish, with black-currant fruit and tar, coffee and cocoa accents. Great potential; hold two to five years at least.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43999
"99840","One of the better Malbec-based wines of the region, this fairly priced blend, which includes 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Syrah, offers a dense core of blackberry jam that's covered by layers of loam, charred beef, black pepper and smoke. The dense black-cherry and blueberry flavors are cut by intense pepper, vanilla bean and prominent cappuccino, all frame by woody tannins.","Red","Malbec","US",99840
"67165","Luscious ripe fruit flavors are balanced by great acidity in this rich but vibrant wine that's blended from Marsanne and Chardonnay. Honeydew melon and white-peach flavors fan out on the palate as the wine's generous texture coats the palate. Subtle spices like vanilla, white pepper and ginger add complexity.","White","White Blend","US",67165
"31845","Hints of honey and caramel lend warmth to this ripe, unusually robust kabinett. Voluptuous body and haulting acidity augment its bold, expansive mouthfeel. A fringe of astringency lends some structure to the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",31845
"57484","Overall this smells entirely like Rioja should. Earthy cherry and plum aromas come with vanilla scents. In the mouth, modest tannins and firm acids create balance, while flavors of oak-driven chocolate and vanilla lead baked plum and berry notes toward a warm, brandied finish. Drink now.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",57484
"27202","Creamy berry and plum aromas register as generic and inoffensive. This is round and full in terms of weight and texture, with herbal, jammy flavors of berry fruits and salt. An herbal, oaky, salty tasting finish is solid but fails to elevate things.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",27202
"23673","This is a fruity wine with red berry flavors and fresh acidity. It is crisp, light and ready to drink, with an attractive smoky aftertaste.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",23673
"43476","Smooth and round while also fruity, this is packed with cherry and fresh plum flavors. It has a rich texture, full and juicy, the acidity giving just the right amount of freshness. Drink now, or age until 2015.","Red","Gamay","France",43476
"98583","Moderately complex but thoroughly inviting aromas of cherry, plum and oak lead to a pure, balanced palate with drying tannins. Flavors of cherry, kirsch, pepper and fresh herbs conclude on a still-kicking finish that's tight and elegant. Drink through 2020.","Red","Mencía","Spain",98583
"60356","Tannic waves of tartness add to a complicated, slightly carbonic edginess in this wine, accentuated by ripe black fruit that almost seems baked. Spicy acidity and a hit of forest floor make it savory and substantially rewarding.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60356
"40780","Sumptuous peach comes across as almost overripe. There certainly is opulence on the rich almost oily palate. Flavors are very concentrated and have edges of caramel and barley sugar, but these are balanced by freshness and a pithy welcomed bitterness. This finishes medium sweet with lingering flavors of both zest and peach.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",40780
"12089","A bouquet of cherry, white chocolate and juniper berry sets the stage for flavors of raspberry, blackberry, blueberry pie and baking spices. It is smooth in the mouth, with a sense of soft sweetness that is neither overpowering nor cloying, bolstered by a pervasive backbone of acidity.","Red","Red Blend","Georgia",12089
"87666","De Loach reaches into Lake County, not usually thought of as Zinfandel country, with tremendous results. This is a great wine by any standard. It shows some heat from high alcohol and some shriveled raisin tastes, but that's part of a ripe Zin's charm. Mostly, you'll be impressed by waves of sweetly ripe berries, chocolate and bacon, smooth tannins and a long, spicy finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",87666
"68715","A soft, simple wine, with a gluey texture and sweet berry and spice flavors.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",68715
"8293","Basic aromas of apple and melon feed into a solid round palate with good acidity. Salty flavors of popcorn and tropical fruits finish flush, balanced and with notes of melon and papaya.","White","Verdejo","Spain",8293
"85755","Sour apple and fennel characterize this wine upon entry. These follow through on the nose and palate around a concentrated core of golden honey and lemony acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",85755
"93274","Taking their cue from the old name for the local vineyards around Deutschkreutz in Mittelburgenland, the Reisners, who run the Igler winery, have fashioned a traditional style of Blaufränkisch. It's impressive, the density of the tannins never overwhelming the ripe, juicy, black fruit flavors. It is certainly a ripe wine, but the richness never overpowers the structure and the acidity.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",93274
"50788","Strawberry and raspberry notes come with a tart edge in this easygoing rosé. On the palate, strawberry, violet and spice notes are balanced and fresh. A good everyday choice that will pair well with fruit salad, chicken salad and cold cuts.","Rosé","Rosé","Greece",50788
"27415","Warm red-berry aromas are simple and fresh, a hallmark of a good Alicante wine. This is a touch sharp and drawing on the palate, with cherry, plum and berry flavors. Crisp and focused on the finish, this ranks as an ideal everyday quaffer.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",27415
"1160","Sourced principally from Klipsun, with smaller amounts from Champoux and Seven Hills, this tight, dark, richly-flavored wine has impeccable credentials. Black fruits, espresso and citrus—notably blood orange—mingle seamlessly, though it takes some hours to open up. The Red Mountain fruit contributes characteristic notes of iron ore and underlying minerality.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1160
"83824","This Brazilian Merlot smells rubbery and gaseous, with saucy berry notes. In the mouth, this is severely tannic and drying. Toasty, blackened and bitter in flavor, this ends with peppery notes and hard-pounding tannins.","Red","Merlot","Brazil",83824
"20360","Perfumed notes of white peach and grapefruit abound on this medium-bodied, off-dry Riesling. It's fresh and fruity, offering juicy green apple and citrus flavors sharpened by edges of lime and lemon. The finish is honeyed and long. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its vibrant style.","White","Riesling","Germany",20360
"97133","This medium-bodied wine is marked by dry, stony notes rather than a profusion of fruit. Subtle leafiness and hints of underripe melon give this a restrained aspect and suggest it's more of a food partner than a wine that will shine on its own.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",97133
"88228","This soft wine is a blend of two local white grapes: Síria and Fonte Cal. Intense acidity and a cool-climate feel from the high- altitude vineyards make this crisp, with grapefruit and lemon flavors. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",88228
"3405","While a tad more slender in frame than many of 2015's single-vineyard Kabinetts, this delicate Riesling offers a zesty punch of sweet-tart tangerine and quince flavors. It's irresistibly thirst quenching, finishing on a salty tang of mineral and lime.","White","Riesling","Germany",3405
"1274","This is a soft wine with its creamy fruits assimilated into the tangy texture. There is plenty of acidity to give this wine its cool character as well as its citrus and green-apple flavors. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",1274
"85811","For whatever reason, the Coddington lacks the extra dimension of the other 2011 Kumeu River Chardonnays. It's still an excellent wine, just linear and crisp, with subtle toast framing citrusy fruit.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",85811
"96708","A slightly heady, volatile touch plays on the nose. The palate is fresh with lemon and zest but also has rounded buttery notes on its concentrated yet light body. A very intriguing dry Riesling that still needs to come into its own. Its dry lightness is a boon. Drink 2020–2025.","White","Riesling","France",96708
"40658","This ripe, cherry-flavored wine has touches of toasty spice from wood aging. It's smooth and soft, with juicy acidity that offsets its rounded texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",40658
"56238","A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",56238
"30693","An attractive floral, appley aroma and generous, ripe apple and herb flavors give this medium-bodied wine plenty of personality.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",30693
"87852","This wine from a biodynamic vineyard is powerfully spicy on the nose, with aromas of ginger snaps, cloves, nutmeg and Indian spices seasoning the bloody meats and blackberry core. Oregano and other chopped, dried herbs flavor the palate, with black pepper, blackberry syrup and licorice combining for a savory sipping experience.","Red","Syrah","US",87852
"33596","A scent of leathery funk inhabits this wine, yet never overtakes the balanced flavors. A mix of blueberry and cherry fills the palate with lush flavors, and highlights of coffee, mocha and salted caramel add further interest. It drinks as a more mature wine than the vintage date might suggest.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33596
"36949","Speri's delicious Ripasso offers thick concentration and pulpy notes of chocolate and black cherry. The wine is soft, velvety and would pair well with oven-baked pasta topped with hearty meat ragú.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",36949
"55142","Almost completely clear and crystalline as ice-cold water, this wine from a Santa Lucia Highlands-based producer shows apple blossoms, Asian pear flesh and white rocks on the clean, fresh nose. It's focused and tight on the palate, suggesting apple and pear peels with pomelo pith.","White","Pinot Gris","US",55142
"105989","Made from organically farmed fruit, this bright Vermentino opens with pretty aromas of peach, honey, pear and Golden Delicious apple. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky.","White","Vermentino","Italy",105989
"19972","This kitchen-sink blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Petit Verdot and Petite Sirah shows squashed black plum, caramelized blueberries, mocha and a sweet cedar touch on the nose. Toasty oak flavors carry the palate, with vanilla, brown sugar, beef char, baked blueberries and a touch of Vietnamese coffee.","Red","Red Blend","US",19972
"99694","This Romanian Pinot Noir has aromas of sweet black cherry, smoked meats and red raspberry. In the mouth there are flavors of smoke and black plums.","Red","Pinot Noir","Romania",99694
"70752","This relatively low-alcohol Zinfandel offers dusty blue fruit and piles of earthiness around a core of juicy texture. Straightforward on the finish, with a hit of herb and fresh farm.","Red","Zinfandel","US",70752
"58087","Neprica is an awesome blend of Negroamaro, Primitivo and Cabernet Sauvignon from southern Italy that offers an unbeatable price versus quality ratio. This rising star of Puglia would pair with meats, pasta or aged cheese and offers clean aromas of ripe fruit, spice and leather.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58087
"25586","This ripe, sun-drenched blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers generous tones of leather, tobacco, licorice, cassis berry, dried hay and spice. It has thick, dark concentration and a long finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",25586
"68668","This rich and relatively soft block-designated wine has a lighter-than-usual color, a rich, buttery aroma and jammy flavors that recall strawberries and plums. It's a smooth variation on the often tannic and restrained personality of Sangiovese.","Red","Sangiovese","US",68668
"89897","Bracing tones of lime and lemon accentuate the crush of mineral tones throughout this dry, revitalizing wine. Light bodied and spry, it's invigorating, rather than penetrating, but ideal as a palate-cleanser between heavy courses.","White","Riesling","Germany",89897
"28514","This wine gets its name from the fossils that abound in the landscape of the vineyards. A blend of Arinto, Viognier and Chardonnay, it is ripe and perfumed. The texture is smooth, but with a mineral edge. Yellow fruits dominate the flavor profile that's balanced with acidity. Drink the wine now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",28514
"35392","This is a young, fruity wine with black currant aromas and delicious, perfumed juicy blackberry fruit. It has all the ripeness of the vintage and the potential to age well. Drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",35392
"21760","Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.","White","Chardonnay","US",21760
"41711","This opens with delicate scents of red berry and fragrant blue flower. The soft, easygoing palate offers juicy wild cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside fresh acidity and round tannins. It's simple but well made.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",41711
"9366","This blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 17% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc offers plummy chocolate and leather notes and dense, layered tannins. Toasty oak adds to the concentration and body, before a lift of acidity closes out the finish. This wine is available in three Halloween-themed labels all created for Flora Springs by CD-cover artist Wes Freed.","Red","Red Blend","US",9366
"82350","Husch is one of the original Anderson Valley wineries and has not been a particular Pinot Noir star, but this fantastic 2014 may start a trend. Fresh and alive, the wine is medium bodied but packs lots of tangy cherry and almost jammy plum flavors into a smooth but lightly tannic texture that provides great structure. Simply delicious, it's balanced well enough to enjoy time after time.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",82350
"37348","This powerful blend of 23% Malbec, 20% Carmenere, 20% Cabernet Franc, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 7% Petite Verdot delivers layered aromas of olallieberry, grape candy, sage, anise and lava rocks. Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity.","Red","Red Blend","US",37348
"35201","Sourced from a 2001 planting of Dijon clone 777 vines, this is a dry, slightly leathery wine with tight flavors of dried figs dusted with cocoa and coffee grounds. It shows moderate depth and length, and seems ready for near-term drinking.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35201
"18382","From a hot year with an early harvest, this Sauvignon smells green and ashy, like asparagus mixed with green tobacco. In the mouth, spunky acidity suggests sharpness, while tangy flavors of nectarine and nettle finish with touches of bell pepper and tarragon.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",18382
"14786","Reustle pioneered this variety (they now make three different bottlings) and this may be the best yet. The texture and depth are impressive, as is the detailed mix of melon and white peach, with just a faint trace of vanilla.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",14786
"50183","An upscale hamburger wine, fruity and spicy. There's a bacony, smoked meat note to the raspberries and cherries that will play well against the char of grilled beef.","Red","Red Blend","US",50183
"69558","Rich aromas like Anjou pears and rose petals combine with generous ripe pear and vanilla flavors. It feels full-bodied but is light in alcohol and has a soothing texture. Good acidity balances the ripeness and the finish lingers.","White","White Blend","US",69558
"73515","Very light aromas of red cherry, rose petal and potpourri barely show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are very flat, with light cranberry and a touch of licorice.","Red","Grenache","US",73515
"44111","Brambly red fruit, bell pepper and spice tones settle on a chunky, jammy palate without much spine or structure. Berry and plum flavors come with a briny aftertaste, while the finish is herbal in character.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",44111
"5043","From a Ulises Valdez-farmed vineyard, along the same fence line as Valdez's Silver Eagle, this smoky, succulent wine has a reductive quality that will benefit from more time in bottle. Blackberry, strawberry and earth provide a fleshy aspect of intrigue. Cellar through 2023.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5043
"96462","A lightweight Chardonnay, with crisp acidity and citrus flavors. It is soft, full of white fruits, with a burst of orange zest. Not for aging, ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",96462
"72791","A touch of vanilla, butter and seared lemons characterize the nose of this wine that also shows pears and apples, making it a solid Chardonnay alternative. The palate offers a hint of marzipan along with juicy lemon pulp and zest as well as richer stone-fruit elements in the midpalate.","White","Viognier","US",72791
"97062","Fresh raspberry and plum aromas are minty but get the job done. This feels raw but not scouring, with prodding acidity and herbal berry, vanilla and paste flavors. Minty, herbal finishing notes touch up against herbaceous.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",97062
"7749","The bottle carries the signature of French sculptor César, who marked his friendship with the Sumeire family, owners of the estate. The wine, the top cuvée of the property, is impressively rich while still being beautifully balanced and fresh. From selected parcels, it is a real food wine, tense with a good texture and a ripe, concentrated aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",7749
"59152","This is a muscular, full-bodied wine showing a nice mix of savory and fruity flavors. A fantastic lively texture of firm acidity and fine tannins come with a lip-smacking freshness that's hard to ignore. The balance and complexity are very attractive and promise versatility with a wide variety of foods.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59152
"52229","Enticing Sangiovese aromas of truffle, ripe dark-skinned berry, pressed violet and new leather lead the way on this delicious red. The smooth succulent palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and wild herb framed in velvety tannins that envelope the palate while a licorice note wraps around the finish. Drink 2018–2026.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",52229
"40135","Ripe plum, tilled earth, violet, espresso and toast aromas waft out of the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and roasted coffee bean alongside fleeting tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",40135
"25750","Fruity and balanced up front, this is juicy and fresh on the palate, and just the slightest bit rich and chewy. Loamy dark-berry fruit flavors are matched by chocolate and bitter coffee notes, while the finish is mellow, toasty and dark.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",25750
"6145","This is a candy sweet, soft wine with flavors of pineapples, orange blossoms, apricots, peaches and caramel. Drink now.","White","Roussanne","US",6145
"70310","Subdued, ripe, yellow pear meets yeasty, almost soy-like savoriness head-on to create a palate full of interest. The wine conveys weight, concentration and a bit of alcoholic heat, but it's all carried of with peppery panache. Lovely now but will only get better.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",70310
"82744","This is a fun, complex wine, a blend of 79% Sauvignon Blanc, 18% Muscat Canelli and 3% Viognier, all mountain-grown. Orange blossom and jasmine permeate the inviting entry before waves of creamy tangerine and peach play on the palate, lifted by lively acidity.","White","White Blend","US",82744
"13947","Fuzzy peach with a companionable co-host of Meyer lemon star in this medium-bodied, voluptuously appealing wine. It's balanced and easy to enjoy, its finish taking on added volume and likability.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",13947
"100967","Made with Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this offers aromas of ripe red berry, fragrant blue flowers and grilled herb. The straightforward palate delivers dried black cherry, clove, black pepper and a hint of espresso. Fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity make it enjoyable now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",100967
"23063","This is a blend of Grenache Noir and Syrah. It's enormously rich in blackberry, cherry and cola fruit, with a long, spicy finish. It's a flashy wine, with its glycerine lending an overall softness.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",23063
"51502","The black pepper and cocoa flavors that always mark this fine vineyard show up again in this dry, tannic wine. So do the blackberries and cassis that make it so sweetly fruity. The acidity is awkward, though, and tastes like it was added to balance out a high alcohol wine.","Red","Syrah","US",51502
"16693","As with Dunham's other Lewis Vineyard designates, this is 100% varietal, showcasing the distinct imprint of the vineyard as it impacts one specific grape. Sharp and smoky, with bright flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit, the wine remains deep, pure and focused as it runs through an extended, detailed finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",16693
"93808","A crisp green-apple note has an appetizing lactic edge that shimmers alongside lemon ice cream and sherbet tones. The palate shows lively, small bubbles that fizz excitedly, with further notions of green apple and tart lemon. The midpalate adds notes of sponge cake to counter the freshness, but the exuberant lemon-sherbet aspect wins the day and lasts through the finish. It would be an ace apéritif, totally refreshing and mouthwatering.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","England",93808
"78337","Tobacco and clove aromas ride high on the mildly leafy bouquet. It feels round, juicy, tannic and tight, with mature berry, spice, earth and leather flavors. It remains earthy and mature on the finish, which fades to a blackened, spicy expression with notes of tomato and spice.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",78337
"76286","Riserva gli Angeli is a beautiful Brunello with plump richness and long-lasting flavors of red fruit, exotic spice, leather and tobacco. Thanks to excellent growing conditions, this lucky vintage shows wonderfully rich texture in the mouth.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",76286
"77396","This wine comes from the state's oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vines, planted in 1957. Light in color, the aromas draw you into the glass with notes of earth, cassis, dried herb and cherry. The cranberry flavors are light and elegant, with a zing of acidity that keeps the interest high. It's a very pretty expression of the variety, best suited for the dinner table.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77396
"41478","Aromatically accenting its herbal, spicy highlights, this sports lightly ripened strawberry and cherry fruit. It's an elegant, well-crafted, nicely balanced wine, with the delicate authority that Josh Bergström brings to all of his wines.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",41478
"80058","Powerful and complex, this is solid and impressive, made from a selection of wines. It is dark, dense, full of blackberry fruit and dry tannins. The wood aging still shows in the spiciness, while the tight fruit flavors bring out the acidity. Drink this wine from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",80058
"4307","Generous and fruit-driven, this brings fully ripened black cherry and blueberry fruit into a thick core of flavor. Its tannins are coated with espresso, dark chocolate and a hint of baking spices. Flavors are solid and substantial, and the wine will continue to evolve nicely as it sheds its baby fat.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4307
"61500","This special selection is already showing some brick around the rim and seems to be aging rapidly. The flavors are mostly herb and root, sassafras and beet root in particular, with the fruit leaning toward Dr. Pepper soda.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",61500
"86858","With a generous bite of acidity, this fine Chardonnay is extremely flavorful. Traditionally one of the winery's top Chards, it's explosive in pineapple, Asian pear, crème brûlée and roasted marshmallow flavors. Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices.","White","Chardonnay","US",86858
"37177","A deep gold-orange color and floral aromas lead to rich, broad peach and apricot flavors that are moderately sweet and nicely concentrated. Lighter than some late-harvest wines, it has more vivid fruit and better balance than others.","White","Viognier","US",37177
"84922","Fermented in stainless steel and then aged in neutral oak, this estate-driven white is crisp and complex, with what comes off as an intensity of dark oak. Gooseberry and lychee provide an intrigue on the nose, before a concentrated finish reveals high acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",84922
"55255","An intense, mineral-driven wine, this is tight and very textured. Its dryness is mitigated by hints of riper mango and apricot that fill out the palate. The structure and the tense acidity show this wine is still young. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",55255
"57917","Initially austere, this is a strongly tannic wine with a firm structure and lean fruits. It is still young and the tannins should soften. Drink from 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",57917
"30710","This dry wine has a medium-dark color with a mahogany rim. It offers strong berry, black pepper and clove aromas and flavors, and a broad, smooth texture. It's full bodied, mouthfilling and spicy.","Red","Grenache","US",30710
"61334","From Laguna Ridge Vineyard, which surrounds the producer's winery, this bottling begs to be explored. It's beguiling from the beginning, with unexpected shots of soy, corn nuts and gamy charcuterie. Big, structured tannins support juicy flavors of black cherry and raspberry, resulting in a complex, velvety mouthfeel. Flourishes of dark chocolate and cardamom tease on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",61334
"63548","A 100% varietal wine fermented in stainless steel, this is a bright, lively tangle of cherry and orange built around bristling acidity that practically sizzles on the palate. Light-bodied and plenty crisp, it mellows to show length and breadth on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63548
"8338","This alcoholic wine (15.9%, and you can taste it) is also tongue-scrapingly tannic. The black cherry and cassis fruit is fabulous, and quite ripe, but the alcohol starts to burn out the finish. Let the record show that some tasters will love this wine.","Red","Dolcetto","US",8338
"65525","The southern coastal region of Algarve is better known for beaches than for wine. This blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah with long wood aging comes from the east of the region and shows great warmth as well as black plum fruit flavors. The juicy fruitiness is balanced by the youthful structure, showing the aging potential of the wine. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",65525
"48598","Delicious and soft in raspberries, cherries and the sweet vanilla and the cinnamon toast of new oak, this is a charming Pinot to drink now. It's light and airy in the mouth. Perfect with a simply prepared grilled steak or lamb chop.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",48598
"78535","Shows ample complexity on the nose, offering up hints of dried apricot and crushed stone to go alongside dominant notes of superripe apple. On the palate, although this lacks the zest and freshness of the very best auslese, it's still a leasing package, combining hints of honeyed richness with ripe pears and spice. Drink over the next 5–10 years.","White","Riesling","Germany",78535
"24731","Pretty good Merlot for its dryness and classy mouthfeel. Shows blackberry, cherry, herb and oak flavors, with solid tannins. Beginning to dry out, so drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",24731
"68470","Silky succulent raspberry and cherry flavors are a luscious counterpoint to the razor's edge of acidity that frames this impeccably balanced wine. It's ripe, fruity and forward, yet offers surprising elegance and length. Drink now through 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",68470
"39654","Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues. It has black plum and some woody char to chew on, but also saline and frisky tartness. Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",39654
"41820","This is an impressive, while unusual, take on the Gamay as grown in Beaujolais. It is spicy and minty, with the long wood aging giving a rich, smooth texture to the red-cherry flavors. It needs another few months, so drink from late 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",41820
"10703","From a consistently top-notch estate, this single vineyard Pinot offers lifted red fruits, florals, as well as cinnamon and star anise thanks to the use of some whole bunch fermentation in the winemaking process. The lightness and brightness carries through onto the palate, with an added earthy core, well balanced acidity, and silky tannins. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",10703
"72172","The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.","Red","Merlot","US",72172
"57546","The oak in this wine is nicely integrated into the fruit, making it barely detectable amid the bold peach and melon flavors. Full and round in the mouth, then long and citrusy on the finish. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",57546
"46043","The wine is from a tiny parcel (around an acre) of vines that are over 30-years-old. It is concentrated both with fine fruit and sweet acidity. Yellow fruits are cut with lime and green plums. A touch of vanilla gives the wine a full final aftertaste. Drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",46043
"81760","Chasing Venus is made in textbook Marlborough style, with aromas and flavors of grassy herbs laid over passion fruit and gooseberries. It's medium in body, pleasantly soft and round in the mouth, just fades a bit rapidly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",81760
"36914","This non-filtered wine is not totally limpid in appearance although it does come on strong in terms of the intensity of its aromas. Well-developed mineral tones frame deep layers of black cherry, leather and spice.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",36914
"66037","This easygoing red opens with delicate aromas of violet and red berry. The fresh, easy-drinking palate offers juicy wild cherry and a light note of white pepper alongside pliant tannins and bright acidity. It's made for sheer drinking pleasure so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",66037
"19670","A bit on the green, feline side, but with enough lemon and lime and sweet oak influences to give it richness. The acidity is wonderful, like biting into a fresh Granny Smith apple.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",19670
"5707","Tarry grit and char are the lead aromas on this Tannat that contains 15% Ruby Cabernet, which is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan. This is rough in feel, with shearing tomato-like acidity. Tomato, red plum and herbal flavors finish dry.","Red","Red Blend","Uruguay",5707
"12372","This lightly oxidized Chard is powdery but not entirely fresh, as it shows aromas of pool water and mealy melon. The palate is chunky and just O.K. in feel, while fleshy flavors of melon and peach end briny and mildly bitter.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",12372
"65217","This no-fuss Valpolicella delivers light cherry and almond flavors. It's a wine to pair with a late-evening ham sandwich or with Chinese food.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",65217
"71816","Whiffs of orange blossoms add delicate floral flair to sweet marmalade and honey tones on this penetrating dessert Riesling. While creamy and sweet on the tongue, earthy mineral tones and piercing acidity add balance and structure. It's delicious now, but certainly an age-worthy wine that will develop gorgeously over the next two decades at least.","White","Riesling","Germany",71816
"67135","A marvelously intense wine, the Chardonnay singing with light toast and acidity. The wine has layers of green apple, spice, a tight texture and orange zest highlights. Age for at least seven years.","White","Chardonnay","France",67135
"95053","A curious whiff of lemon pastry entices on the nose of this sprightly wine. The palate is intensely ripe, bursting with sweet honeysuckle nectar and tangerine, yet it's almost lacy in texture, cut by a spray of green-apple acidity. It's delicious already, but sure to hold well for another decade.","White","Riesling","Germany",95053
"7830","L'Ardì shows sweet and succulent fruit flavors with plump aromas of red cherry and plum. Dolcetto is a great wine to pair with grilled sausage or pepperoni pizza.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",7830
"74626","This plump, creamy-textured Riesling shows plenty of flattering peach and lime fruit, but also enough mint and slate that it avoids being simply fruity. Balanced toward the dry side of the Riesling spectrum, so it should prove versatile at the table.","White","Riesling","Germany",74626
"7308","Rich, opulent and spicy, with a great balance between wood and fruit. The generous black plum and black currant fruit is delicious, balanced by taut acidity. Keep for 3-4 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",7308
"91615","This wine's peppery details act as counterpoint to its well-defined raspberry and cherry flavors. Streaks of toast and graphite add to the layers, suggesting further complexity will develop with another year or two in bottle.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91615
"27388","Mineral, dried peach, lees and honeysuckle aromas lead to just off-dry flavors. Racy acidity frames it nicely.","White","Riesling","US",27388
"90717","Fresh citrus aromas follow through to the crisp, lemon and grapefruit flavors of this wine. To balance, a tangy texture, red currant fruits and intense acidity give this tasty wine all its poised presence. This blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Mouvédre is from certified organic vineyards.","Rosé","Rosé","France",90717
"34573","Aromas of coffee, barrel spice and dark-blue fruit lead to rich, full-bodied blackberry and spice flavors. It's not for the faint of heart but delivers a lot of enjoyment.","Red","Syrah","US",34573
"93488","This is the culty Santa Cruz Mountains-based winery's entry level blend of 35% Mourvèdre, 27% Grenache, 19% Carignane, 16% Syrah and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it'll put hooks in newbies, with elegant, soft and silky aromas of violet. The palate combines the purple flowers with acai fruit flavors, making for an addictive sip.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",93488
"94693","An earthy Chardonnay, with herb-infused citrus and peach flavors, overlaid with sweet oak. It's soft and a little sweet and ready to drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",94693
"89292","A new joint venture between winemaker Jorge Moreira and owner the Bergqvist family, both of Quinta de la Rosa. The vineyard is in the remote Douro Superior. You can certainly smell the dry heat in this young wine. To taste it has a Port-like smoothness overlying its dry tannins. The fruit is sweet, succulent, layered with blackberry jam and dark berries.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",89292
"67060","Aromas of dark berry, scorched earth and leather take shape in the glass. The forward palate offers ripe sour cherry and grilled herb alongside round but not very persistent tannins. Drink through 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",67060
"105363","Rich flavors of cherries, persimmons, cola, anise and oak flood the mouth with immediate deliciousness. Bright Russian River acidity provides fortunate balance. It's delicious now, but young; this has the balance to develop nicely, so give it 6–7 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105363
"100898","This has aromas of berry, raisin and toasted oak. The linear palate reveals raspberry and cherry flavors accompanied by accents of espresso and oak. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",100898
"3224","Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",3224
"47814","Pungent and green on the nose, this is showing cool-climate aromas. In the mouth, this is shear and tangy, with a high level of citric acidity. Flavors of lime, Granny Smith apple and asparagus finish briny, crisp and scouring.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",47814
"5360","This Cabernet has blackberry and dried herb flavors, with sizable tannins and pretty hefty acidity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",5360
"53604","This is a fresh and easy selection, with low-intensity aromas and flavors of tart gooseberry, lemon-lime citrus and soft grass. The mouthfeel is light and breezy, and the finish is clean and brisk. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Israel",53604
"71853","Coming from Cerro Prieto Vineyard, one of the few places to grow Pinot Noir in this appellation, this bottling shows aromas of clove, vanilla, sandalwood and pomegranate on the nose. Light pomegranate and tart red-fruit flavors dominate the palate, with a touch of dried herb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71853
"83343","A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, with one-quarter Sémillon, this white blend was aged on the lees in oak barrels. It shows the balanced elegance this bottling by Brander usually displays. Entirely dry, with a crisp burst of acidity, its flavors are of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and a touch of tart, New Zealand-style gooseberry. Great with roast pork or, if you can get it, wild boar.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",83343
"72802","Subdued aromas of red berry, sweet baking spice, rose and a balsamic note lift out of the glass. On the tight, tense palate, bracing tannins frame wild cherry, white pepper, clove, powdered sage and anisette.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",72802
"77497","Crisp acidity and citrus fruitiness combine with a riper, textured character. The wine shows the strong minerality inherent in whites from Pernand-Vergelesses, as well as a richer streak. Because of its structure, it should age. Drink from 2016.","White","Chardonnay","France",77497
"39942","Not a mere whole-cluster wine, the Stalker is made by drying the stalks separately and adding them to whole berries. It's slightly chalky as a result, with a green edge to the tannins and green tea flavors. Black cherry, espresso and cacao components also factor in. Give it another couple of years and drink after 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",39942
"75127","There's a reduced, bitter quality to this wine, which remains light-bodied and somewhat elusive in the glass. An extreme sense of earthiness and mushroom, veering on dampness, keeps it a sensory quandary.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75127
"41609","This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.","White","Chardonnay","France",41609
"46088","Big and densely tannic, this wine's fruit is still firmly buried in the structure. It has wood, spice and ripe plum notes. With its concentrated texture, it is still capable of aging.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",46088
"90093","Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",90093
"96680","Lime, chewing gum and dusty aromas are simple. This is juicy but shows no real point of reference on the palate. Hollow flavors of pear and briny citrus finish with a note of nectarine and scouring acidity.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",96680
"27881","This ripe, Merlot-dominated wine offers bold tannins and black plum-skin fruitiness. It has spice, toastiness from wood aging and the potential of a ripe and generous character. It is firm at this stage and needs to age, so drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",27881
"66979","This cru is a structured wine that is full of dry tannins. It has hints of the typically Morgon dark-cherry fruit underneath along with acidity. It is likely to remain a firm wine. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",66979
"32098","Fairly sweet aromas of marzipan, honeysuckle, candied apricot and honeyed orange slices show on the nose of this bottling from a longtime winegrowing family in the Watsonville area. It's much tighter and brighter on the sip, with flavors of slightly sour green-pear skins and poached apple, and a touch of caramel on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",32098
"69634","Meaty and savory with balsamic notes, it will need hearty food to tone its wildness and size. At 15.4% from a great vineyard, there's heat on the finish, that again food might tame.","Red","Barbera","US",69634
"37906","This wine is rich, spicy and full of black fruit. With solid tannins alongside its juicy black currant flavors, it's firm and will age well. Its density and richness are developing and will be best from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",37906
"5794","There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",5794
"1411","Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",1411
"34181","On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017.","White","Viognier","Australia",34181
"37955","The flagship bottling for this winery, this brings aromas of dried herbs, dark chocolate, espresso bean, black currant and cherry. The dark fruit flavors are rich and concentrated, possessing a layered mouthfeel that captures the attention.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",37955
"93061","This Syrah was aged in 100% new oak, two thirds American and one third French. Barrel flavors abound, especially vanilla, and the fruit seems a bit overshadowed at this point in time. The tannins are aggressive, and overall this young wine seems to need more time in bottle to smooth out.","Red","Syrah","US",93061
"77765","Not that much Hunter Shiraz makes it to the U.S. these days, but this bottling from Wyndham Estate is a nice example. It shows rather clean winemaking, with strong vanilla and cedar notes from barrel aging to go alongside blueberry and blackberry fruit. Only mildly tannic, so it's approachable now, but should age through at least 2012.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",77765
"972","A rich full wine that has swathes of black fruits. It has a dry core around which there are generous fruits and the right amount of acidity. Perfumed, ripe and concentrated, this is ready to drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",972
"12697","Tiny percentages of Syrah and Petite Sirah play minor roles in this vineyard-designate. They add to the soft, juicy and focused concentration of big-boned red fruit, cinnamon and tangy, tart acidity.","Red","Zinfandel","US",12697
"31826","A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure. A bit acidic on the palate but staunchly fresh, with good fruit flavor in the red plum category. Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.","Red","Grenache","Spain",31826
"52831","Except for some resiny oak, this wine is limited on the nose. It feels fleshy but balanced by citric acid, while the flavors include melon, pear and oak-driven spice. It's not too fruity, exact or minerally, but it will likely please fans of basic, casual Chardonnay.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",52831
"4002","This comes from a complicated blend of Muscadelle, Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc: a touch from both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Grapefruit and peach flavors bring out the best of the grapes, giving a wine that is both fresh and ripe. It is bright and tangy at the end. Drink from late 2017.","White","White Blend","France",4002
"102951","A serious contender with sophisticated notes of leather, barnyard and cedar wrapped up in toasty vanilla oak. A hint of char adds an edge to a streamlined palate infused with earth, mushroom and strawberry tones. A slight lack of persistence takes it out of the top flight. Fully mature, drink now.","Red","Barbera","Italy",102951
"5469","A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that shows why this warmish Santa Barbara County valley is such a natural home for the variety. With crisp acidity and a creamy texture, it's dry and minerally, with interestingly rich flavors of citrus fruits, melons and pears, and a touch of smoky oak.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",5469
"19957","A big, powerful, fruity wine, this is laden with dry tannins as well as blackberry flavor. Dark and concentrated, it has a solid, dense feel with fruits layered with intense wood notes. It needs at least five years to soften and round out.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",19957
"78059","This is a handsome wine all the way, from the lightly spicy aromas through the layered fruit, chocolate and cinnamon flavors, to the moderately tannic and lingering finish. With its great balance and mouthwatering flavors, it will be a tasty addition to almost any meal.","Red","Barbera","US",78059
"93999","Produced at Domaine la Gemière in Sancerre, this ripe full-fruited wine is perfect to drink young. Packed with citrus fruits with a strong mineral edge, the wine is rich and floral. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",93999
"77319","Dark hibiscus, deep red cherry and rare roast beef show on the nose of this wine from Malibu that is fragrant but fairly light in aromas. Pencil shavings, baked blackberry and a touch of clove show on the sip, which is juicy and interesting.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77319
"100660","Black cherry and cassis aromas are sweet and ripe. The palate is lively and shows zippy acids along with roasted berry flavors that are juicy due to the fresh acidity. Darkens up on the finish, showing coffee, chocolate and good length. Uncomplicated, fruity Syrah.","Red","Syrah","Chile",100660
"102795","From a 40-plus-year-old vineyard, this peppery wine is dry, fruity and bold. It combines peach, apple and orange fruit flavors with a lusciously full-bodied mouthfeel that's also layered and well structured. Drink now and over the next decade.","White","Riesling","US",102795
"50287","Pretty blossom and apricot aromas bolster ripe, rich flavors of honey tangerine and yellow peach in this forward, fruity wine. There's no pretense here: It's a hedonistic guzzler of a wine, but its tangy salt-and-lime finish makes it hard to resist another glass. Drink while young.","White","Riesling","Germany",50287
"36308","Produced from 65-year-old vines, this is a rich and perfumed wine from the estate of Nicolas Potel. It is structured, balancing the red fruits and acidity with a solid framework of tannins. Spice from the wood aging shows lightly, while the wine finishes with crisp red-currant acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",36308
"28277","Pretty much as good as Bjornstad's single-vineyard bottlings. It's opulent and creamy, with exotic tropical fruit, green apple, pear and honey flavors, elaborately oaked and spicy. Wonderful acidity gives a clean scour to all the richness.","White","Chardonnay","US",28277
"22194","A terrific value if you like the style, this is an impressively concentrated, slightly syrupy Shiraz imbued with potent cassis fruit and framed with vanilla oak. Surprisingly long on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",22194
"19523","A happy tradition of Emilia-Romagna, this frizzante Lambrusco opens with foxy notes of raw grapes and blackberry. There's a touch of bitter almond on the close.","Sparkling","Lambrusco","Italy",19523
"72078","The wine's stalky character, acidity and black-currants are lit by light tannins. It is likely to age quickly, and be ready to drink from 2018.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",72078
"70282","This full-bodied wine smells ripe and buttery, like a pear tart, and has similar tasty flavors like ripe apple, vanilla and cream. Though it's not technically sweet, the personality is generous and the texture soft and rich.","White","Viognier","US",70282
"50068","The 200-acre Shea vineyard provides fruit to many of Oregon's best winemakers. Here is the estate's own brand, offering up a fragrant, appealing blend from various blocks. Floral highlights, dusty spices, a whiff of cocoa and a streak of nut butter all come into focus around pretty purple fruits. The finish is silky, long and lovely.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50068
"102204","Seccal is a wine you can count on for richness, intensity and overall appeal. It is soft and smooth, enhanced by lively aromas of red fruit, prune, brown sugar and barbecue spice.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",102204
"74184","Light purple in color, this aromatically appealing, fruit-forward wine has notes of dark plum, dried herbs and peppery spices along with a mocha top note. It's plump and velvety in feel, with concentrated yet lithe fruit flavors that linger effortlessly on the long, fruit-filled finish that kicks it up a notch.","Red","Malbec","US",74184
"103323","Peat, flower, smoked meat and earthy funk aromas are at the fore. The flavors show a combination of richness and elegance, with smoked meat and olive brine flavors that linger.","Red","Syrah","US",103323
"19070","Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is exuberantly rich and sweet in ripe blackberry, black cherry and chocolate fruit. Smoky oak plays a crucial role, in both flavors and texture. It's a very pretty, polished wine, elegant and balanced and ready to drink now. Production was a hefty 11,000 cases.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",19070
"64320","Jammy raspberry and plum aromas are primary and fresh on the nose. This ripe, round wine is sure to be a party-pleaser. Solid cassis, berry and spice flavors finish pure, with ripeness and proper balance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",64320
"65120","Don't confuse this with the winery's regular Riesling, which is off-dry. This is their dry bottling, and it's a superior wine. Shows vital, crisp acidity that makes the mouth water, then follows up with rich citrus, green apple, Asian pear and peppery spice flavors that are tantalizing and complex. One of the more compelling dry Rieslings out there, but the 100-case production will make it hard to find.","White","Riesling","US",65120
"73621","Underbrush, grilled porcini, red berry and grilled herb aromas lead the way. The bracing palate offers dried wild cherry, clove, cinnamon and powdered sage alongside astringent tannins. Drink after 2018.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",73621
"72649","Young and spicy, this medium-bodied red offers fruit driven sensations of blackberry, black currant, crushed plum and ground white pepper. Polished tannins and fresh acidity give it focus and a drink-now vibe, but it has the structure for modest cellaring. Drink through 2018.","Red","Syrah","Italy",72649
"55377","Feels a little off in the mouth, with edgy tannins that give it a sandpapery texture. But it's interesting in flavor, showing everything from black cherries and currants to tobacco, pepper, salted charred beef fat, persimmons and cola. The multi-variety blend includes Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Merlot.","Red","Red Blend","US",55377
"7280","Full-bodied and velvety, this opens with alluring aromas of baking spice, mature plum, violet, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The concentrated palate is smooth and robust, but it also boasts a weightless quality, delivering dried black cherry, nutmeg, cinnamon, anise, dried date and pipe tobacco alongside firm polished tannins and fresh acidity. A mineral note closes the finish. This is the best Sfursat 5 Stelle I've tried so far. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",7280
"80740","The enticing scent of green mango chopped with mandarin leaves sets the exotic tone. On the palate the aromatic leafiness becomes even more delicious and pronounced. White pepper, citrus leaves, and rich, ripe tropical fruit sear on the palate. This is dramatic stuff and oh so moreish. Hints of candied lime zest roar in the background. The spicy finish is very long and leaves you wanting more.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",80740
"88312","While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88312
"64110","A deep, dense concentration of black cherry and berry provides richness and juiciness to this wine, the fruit wrapped around velvety waves of full-bodied texture and a supporting wall of oak. Earthy licorice and black tea appear on the long finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64110
"62655","Slightly briny aromas akin to orange peel open this citric PG. Dry orange flavors are more or less it, while this holds steady and stays fresh across a standard finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Argentina",62655
"70887","Take Souverain's basic Chardonnay, released last year, oak it up, and you get this reserve. Buttered toast, butterscotch, apricot, tropical fruit and honey flavors are prominent. Ready to drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",70887
"269","Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",269
"68120","Small production (one barrel!) single-vineyard Pinots are challenging, as there is no wiggle room via blending. This comes out crisp and focused, with light cherry fruit and ample flavors of tea, herb and leaf.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68120
"28469","Smooth and fruity, sleek and spicy, it oozes sweet cherry and strawberry flavors. Feeling silky for all its ripeness, it has just a touch of tannin to help the finish linger. It's made from Syrah, Zinfandel and three other varieties.","Red","Red Blend","US",28469
"70108","Intense aromas of red-skinned berry, fragrant blue flower, Oriental spice and a whiff of graphite take center stage. The taut, chewy palate doles out Marasca cherry, blackberry, anise, mocha and a peppery note alongside bright acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",70108
"52424","Poised, elegant, light and fresh, this is delicate Riesling, with an edge of minerality, steel and green fruits. This comes from the Kögl, at the heart of the Salomon Undhof vineyard holdings. Glass stopper.","White","Riesling","Austria",52424
"1949","This Amarone is loaded with big fruit sensations of ripe cherry and plum, along with raisin, chocolate and oak accents. It's rather one dimensional, but has delicious fruit and is perfect for immediate enjoyment.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",1949
"99963","You can technically call this a table wine, but it's really sweet, with orange and honey flavors.","White","Moscato","US",99963
"46529","One of the drier, more elegantly structured Sangiovese out there. It shows subtle red cherry, red currant and tobacco flavors, laced with white pepper. A hard streak of acidity cuts through the middle, suggesting softening things like olive oil, lamb, mozzarella cheese.","Red","Sangiovese","US",46529
"49299","Hints of nut and fresh-baked brioche lend savory nuance to bright apple flavors in this Pinot Blanc sparkling. Thick, almost chewy foam fills the palate but brisk citrus acidity on the midpalate balances things out nicely.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",49299
"26534","This blends 64% Syrah with 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot to good effect, offering tomato leaf, leather, dried herb and lavender aromas. Savory, meaty and medium bodied on the palate, it pairs well with heavier fare.","Red","Red Blend","US",26534
"97319","Despite the almost syrupy fruit and alcohol pushing 16%, the fruit scents are less than optimal, suggesting that perhaps the grapes were pushed too far. Along with notes of plant material, the alcoholic heat mars the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",97319
"56405","A reductive note of rubber tire threads through the mélange of cherry cola, iron ore and red licorice flavors in this wine. The components have not yet integrated, leading to a finish marked by bitter skin and tannins. Give it another couple of years of bottle age before pulling the cork.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56405
"60888","This is a friendly and very approachable screwcap Pinot Grigio with good consistency, a dim golden hue and aromas of honey, stone fruit and citrus flower. The mouthfeel is lean and simple and the wine offers a fresh, palate-cleansing finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",60888
"82632","Despite the low abv, this is a dry rosé, made from 100% Sangiovese that was picked at 20.5 brix. It's delicate and satisfying—a pretty pale copper/rose color, with flavors of strawberry hinting at peach. There's a dusting of baking spices and cocoa, adding welcome highlights to the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",82632
"91349","This Chardonnay is generally solid. However, on the nose, palate and finish you'll find a briny, almost pickled character to go with aromas of citrus fruits, flavors of melon and apple, and finishing notes of melon and lime. All in all, there's not a lot to this wine.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",91349
"4659","An initial hit of reduction blows off to reveal rich vanilla backed by gentle lemon purity. This clearly needs some time in bottle to find its middle but all the basics are there: freshness, clean fruit, texture and poise. Drink 2028–2025.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",4659
"33875","Ripe, muscular aromas of forest floor, blackberry, cassis and violet are stunningly attractive. This is showing vise-grip tannins in support of blackberry, licorice, mocha and woodspice flavors. Café mocha and an oaky, creamy note of toffee work the finish on this well-structured wine that should be drunk from 2015–2025.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",33875
"88961","Lifted, lemony freshness mixes with lime zest on the nose. Underneath some pungent arugula also dances on the palate, where pepperiness and fresh acidity guarantee pleasure with this concentrated but toned white.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",88961
"35095","Floral and sweet on the front side of the nose and more dark, grilled and coffee-like on the back end. The palate is more juicy and snappy than some, with no shortage of acidity. Tastes of live-wire cherry and plum, with a long, driving finish. Needs time to settle; drink in late 2010.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",35095
"5520","Intensely aromatic, this is a spicy, sublime and soft wine, elegant and unexpected, bright and alive and fresh instead of overbearing. Its rustic roots endear rather than distract, with an exuberance of blueberry at its core.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",5520
"43021","Vanilla wraps itself around cherry, cranberry and pomegranate to open with a ripe bang before this wine delves into darker tar notes and big tannins. Powerfully dense and concentrated, it maintains an herbal overtone that suggest further potential over time.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",43021
"4776","Lightly spicy, this soft wine has a zesty tang of orange and bright strawberries that are ripe and gently fruity. The wine is open, ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",4776
"80043","Aromas of cured meat, violet and grilled herb waft out of the glass. The rather diluted palate offers wild cherry, game and a salty note alongside fleeting tannins and zesty acidity.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",80043
"9628","A rich, dry wine, soft and velvety in tannins. It feels satisfying all the way through. Not super-big in fruit, but nuanced, offering layers of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, herbs, leather and pepper. One of the finer Syrahs to come out of the Sierra Foothills this year. Ready now.","Red","Syrah","US",9628
"52931","A soft wine, creamy and ripe. The flavors are open, with white fruits, green plums, a baked apple character. There is acidity, but with the gentle, ripe fruit, this blends in easily. For early drinking.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",52931
"50057","Savory and fresh, this easygoing, medium-bodied red doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, anise and ground pepper. Round, soft tannins give it immediate appeal.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",50057
"7072","This is a big, broad-shouldered Sauvignon Blanc, slightly oily in texture, with pungent scents of crushed tomato leaf and plenty of gooseberry fruit. The high alcohol, moderate acidity and richly concentrated fruit give the impression of sweetness on the long finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",7072
"89933","Bridgitte and her husband Eric took over her family property in 2009, in 2014 producing a spicy and fruity wine. It has fine tannins and sweet red-berry fruit. The acidity and the balance are just right. Drink this attractive wine from 2018. They donate one percent of their turnover to an environmental charity and are (they say) one of only two wineries in the world who are members of “1% for the planet.”","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",89933
"23691","Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",23691
"34286","A rounded mouthfeel and plenty of fruit flavors, like apple and honeydew, make this medium-bodied wine user-friendly. The acidity is soft, and the flavors drop off quickly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",34286
"77876","Lively, fruity and made to be drunk young, this is a crisp red-fruit-flavored wine. It has acidity and a tangy orange peel character. Drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",77876
"15159","Quite minty and herbal on first take, with a hardness to the bouquet. The palate is racy, herbal, roasted and very much tastes different than most Argentine wines because it's from Cafayate in the north; look for spice, tomato, herbal waves and meaty notes.","Red","Syrah","Argentina",15159
"33861","Closed aromas make it a challenge at first to get a read on this wine that takes time to unfurl touches of herb and dried fruit. Soft in tannin and low in oak, it offers a depth of black cherry and vanilla on the palate, with a touch of cedar and currant.","Red","Merlot","US",33861
"14432","Soft white cherry and strawberry are hit with a pink floral accent on the nose of this easy, breezy rosé. Lightweight and refreshing, the finish is clean and bright in white berry flavor. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",14432
"82760","Reserved on the nose at first, this wine eventually releases pressed black raspberry and elderberry fruit as well as a peppery teriyaki element. Similar fresh fruit shows on the palate, enhanced by anise, dried sage and other aromatic herbs.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",82760
"80453","This 100% varietal wine comes from one of the state's top vineyards. Brooding aromas of pitted cherry, coffee, cocoa, vanilla and spice lead to tart cranberry and cherry flavors. The tannins bring a coarse feel. Perhaps they will soften with some additional time in bottle.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80453
"35263","A ripe and rounded wine, with friendly apricot and lemon flavors, richly toasty, leaving great acidity and bright fruits at the end.","White","Chardonnay","France",35263
"71620","Tastes like the grapes got a little too ripe in the heat, resulting in a distinct raisiny taste that would be more appropriate to Port than a Cabernet Sauvignon. The alcohol is nearly 15% by volume. Hard to see this Cab aging well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71620
"39573","This beautifully balanced wine boasts and enviable combination of structure and finesse. It opens with enticing aromas of pressed rose, iris, wild berry, cake spice and a whiff of pressed powder while the full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, star anise and clove. Firm, ultra-fine tannins provide the framework. Drink 2020–2032.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",39573
"68086","Actually a Bordeaux blend, this mainly merlot wine from the Umpqua valley in central Oregon outdoes its peers with dark, plummy, even jammy fruit laced with toast, tar and espresso. Sweet fruit meets stiff tannins, all in the name of structure.","Red","Merlot","US",68086
"25054","Gufo means “owl” in Italian and indeed a cartoon of one is pictured on the label. A pure expression of Nebbiolo, this wine offers drying mineral or chalky notes with some cherry in the background over a crisp, clean style. Pair it with thick crust Chicago pizza.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",25054
"54891","Slightly sweet and crisp, this blend of five varieties, mainly Sauvignon Blanc, has juicy flavors of apricots, grapefruits, oranges and spices. Nice with fruit, sushi, chicken enchiladas.","White","White Blend","US",54891
"27235","Produced from Malbec and fashionably pale, this wine is named after Julie Perrin, daughter of owner Alain-Dominique Perrin. It is light and deliciously crisp and refreshing. Bone dry, it is certainly a food rosé, although with its light raspberry flavor it will also be good as an apéritif. Julie Perrin, an artist, worked on the blend and created the château watercolor on the bottle.","Rosé","Rosé","France",27235
"62068","Sweet-seeming fruit and maple flavors give a candy-like quality to this medium-bodied, ripe and soft wine. The vanilla and maple flavors meld nicely with rich raspberry and sweet cherry notes.","Red","Zinfandel","US",62068
"74500","A beautifully proportioned wine, from its rich yet mineral texture to its full grapefruit and gooseberry flavors. It gradually shows toast as well as wonderful acidity. For aging over 4–6 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",74500
"81075","This concentrated wine is solid with tannins. The fruit is evident from the fine acidity and hints of black plum that push through the wall of tannin. Give it time and drink from 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",81075
"902","Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option.","White","Chardonnay","US",902
"94489","Voluptuously lush and creamy, this is thick in vanilla swirls and crème brûlée, with full-bodied concentration of baked apple. Rich and round, it finishes in a yeasty tone of brioche.","White","Chardonnay","US",94489
"65672","This blend of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah is soft, simple and a little sweet. It has jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, black raspberries and anise.","Red","Red Blend","US",65672
"78420","The wine, from one of the five Aubert family properties, is rich and full of great fruit. With ripe tannins and blackberry generosity over the wood aging, this is still structured yet ready to drink.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",78420
"67848","Floral in aroma, this was aged in one-third new French oak and left unfined and unfiltered. It offers tart cherry and wild strawberry notes in a light-toned, ripe package, the secondary characteristics herbal and earthy.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67848
"101146","This wine shows smooth red fruit that is light and generic, with modest weight and an earthy flavor. The wine spent a bit of time in 25% new oak, though it doesn't show up in the flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101146
"96073","La Carte is a small vineyard in Lugny, producing this delicious crisp fruit-driven wine. It is lively with acidity and ripe with peach and baked pear fruits. The texture is just enough to allow it to age, so drink from mid-2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",96073
"102901","This blend of coastal and desert grapes smells and tastes tropical, with floral notes and a preponderance of citrus character. There isn't too much variation to the flavor profile, which is centered on white citrus fruits.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",102901
"102518","There is a flinty touch of reduction on the nose. The frothy palate follows with freshness and verve: there is rhubarb and lime peel, fresh lemon and tart greengage. The frothiness makes this exuberant and fun while the generous dosage puts us in mind of spring flowers and elder blossom.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","England",102518
"27412","This fresh, appealing wine is lightly spritzy, with flavors of pear and melon that show persistence.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",27412
"22226","Not your average white, this white Rhône-style blend looks, tastes and feels almost like a late-harvest wine but it's dry. A deep gold color leads to an aroma of salted peanuts and a flavor that's buttery, toasty and nutty. The texture is quite thick and helps the flavors cling to the palate on the finish.","White","White Blend","US",22226
"937","This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.","Red","Red Blend","US",937
"30418","Here's a hearty blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Merlot that opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, truffle, tobacco and meat juice. The lush palate delivers juicy black cherry, blackberry, spearmint and thyme alongside rippling but refined tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",30418
"64379","An exemplary rendition of the RR reserve bottling, this vintage is loaded with honey and spice. Smooth, off-dry, complex and full bodied, it's in perfect balance between sweetness and tang, mixing fruit and skin components with that succulence. Lively and energetic, it's delicious now but will benefit from age. Drink through 2030.","White","Riesling","US",64379
"44592","This blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Merlot opens with aromas of berry, mocha and toasted coffee bean. The palate is friendly and forward, with plum and blackberry accompanied by a hint of chocolate.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",44592
"10965","A delicious Cab, polished and supple, with ripe black and red currant, raspberry, violet, cedar and mocha flavors. Feels soft and velvety in the mouth. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",10965
"5461","A rich Sauvignon Blanc, with powerful, complex flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass, tart green apples and white peaches. It's very dry and crisp in acidity. Shows an extra level of textural complexity that raises the score.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",5461
"50256","Restrained in aromatics, this is a ripe, round and soft ZIn with a Port-like personality, streaks of cedar through the mid-palate and a touch of heat on the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",50256
"19223","Sweetly ripe on the nose, this is a meaty, full-bodied and somewhat oaky white wine. The majority of the fruit comes from Sonoma County, the rest from Napa. White peach and vanilla mark the palate, finishing fresh and round.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",19223
"60065","Aged in white oak barrels from Minnesota, the winemaker's home state, this wine offers exotic honeysuckle and baked pineapple at its core, beautiful aromas that gain weight on the texture. Toasted caramel and coconut define the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",60065
"96066","Rich and smooth, this wine shows delicious red fruits as well as good acidity. It is stylish, ripe with fruit and with a tight texture that hints at minerality. The wine is ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",96066
"53402","The folks at Tenuta Vitanza have always shown a deft hand when it comes to crafting intense and dense Brunellos. This expression shows that trademark extraction followed by pretty aromas of dark cherry, tobacco and prune. But there's also a drying touch of dusty mineral that gives the wine elegance and finesse.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",53402
"51183","Young and sassy, this wine is already showing lovely nuances of toast, spice, lees and mineral. Complex, vivid and beautifully balanced, with a lot of fresh leesy texture and the tangy fruit riding on top. Classy winemaking, elegant and sophisticated.","White","Chardonnay","US",51183
"26578","A dense, baked, raisiny nose is ultra ripe but also a bit flabby and damp-smelling. A big, grabby mouth-filler, this offers baked, oaky flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate, finishing with lingering chocolate and prune. Drink this chunky, superripe Priorat sooner rather than later.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",26578
"57865","Tropical fruit flavors form the base of this wine, but over the ripe mango flavor rides a heavy layer of toasty oak, and it's questionable whether it will integrate before the fruit starts to fade. Drink now for its lusty obviousness.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",57865
"82939","Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish. Drink this high-quality value now through 2013. A blend of Malbec at 50%, with Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",82939
"8249","As befits a single vineyard Gevrey Chambertin, this is a structured wine, firmly rooted in tannins. Hidden beneath are black plum and cherry flavors that are raring to go—rich and sumptuous. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",8249
"3288","Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",3288
"87645","Sandalwood and smoke kick off the nose on this deliciously complex bottling that also shows aromas of black-plum skin, crushed slate and light fennel on the nose. Tangy cranberry and pomegranate make for a fresh entry to the sip, and then come herbal touches of white sage, bay leaf and peppercorn.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87645
"12040","Crushed mineral and tart melon rind notes lend a crisp, slender tone to this medium sweet Riesling. Its spry, filigreed texture is accentuated by high-toned acidity. The finish is only moderately long but refreshingly citrusy.","White","Riesling","Germany",12040
"87800","From the heart of Oakville, this 100% varietal wine is luxurious, silky and velvety on the palate, a masterful study of texture. Lengthy and balanced, despite its powerful fruit, it suggests dark plum and cassis, with just a tiny note of cherry, the tannins refined and chalky. Cellar through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87800
"38712","Light-bodied and crisp, this delivers tart cherries and a whack of mocha-tinged oak, which dominates the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",38712
"48548","Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance. Problem is, there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs, it pales in flavor and generosity. Also, the finish is kind of scratchy and thin.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",48548
"95836","An 84% Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, it reveals a plethora of oak nestled around dried cranberry, bittersweet chocolate and cigar. Medium bodied, it benefits from additional time in the glass.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95836
"32542","This wine is a unique blend of Syrah, Merlot, Viognier, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. It seems locked up, with aromas of pickling spices, smoke, berry and vanilla that are followed by broad blue and black-fruit flavors that provide appeal.","Red","Red Blend","US",32542
"87222","Here's a satiny, approachable red blend with notes of black currant, brandy-soaked cherry and a touch of vanilla bean on the nose and mouth. A savory peppery spice reveals itself on the end, with moderate tannins lingering through the close.","Red","Red Blend","South Africa",87222
"26701","This is a fine, dry, crisp sipper with rewarding flavors of citrus fruits, figs, wildflowers, honey, thyme and pepper. With its crisp acidity and oak-tinged creamy texture, its spectrum falls between Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",26701
"46595","From grapes grown at this estate and vinified by the Tutiac cooperative in Blaye on the north bank of the Gironde Estuary, this wine is easy, soft and fruity. With black-currant fruit and acidity, it reflects the fruitiness of the vintage and is likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from late 2017.","Red","Merlot","France",46595
"51158","With no time spent in oak, this bright, simple Sauvignon Blanc has pear, grapefruit and gooseberry notes and a quick finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",51158
"58574","A pale pink color, this clean, refreshing rosé offers nuanced notes of strawberry hull, white melon rind and just-ripe peach on the nose and mouth. The bright, juicy palate is zippy and refreshing, with lively acidity and citrus-driven flavors that carry through to the mouthwatering finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",58574
"70974","Some kind of magic is happening here. As the lowest-priced Chardonnay in Stoller's lineup, this may turn out to be your favorite. Using all-stainless steel, this sleek style brings out the aromatics, texture and detail. There's tensile strength here, herb-tinged accents, clean and juicy citrus-inflected fruit and superb balance throughout.","White","Chardonnay","US",70974
"48779","This Riserva Brunello shows sharp, brambly characteristics of forest berry and white cherry. Although the nose is prickly and awkward, the wine wins points in the mouth thanks to its softness and plushness.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",48779
"92548","This offers simple layers of cherry, spice, cola and toasted almond. The mouthfeel is soft, plush and mild.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",92548
"65909","A pure expression of the Garganega grape, Rocca Sveva is a fresh and tart Soave Classico with spicy notes of stone fruit, yellow flower and dried herbs. Pair this wine with easy grilled tuna steak and sesame sauce.","White","Garganega","Italy",65909
"66128","Perfumed and elegant, this wine is a highlight within the producer's line up of consistently well-made wines. Waxy honeycomb and floral aromas accent fresh green notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's lean in style, yet plush with sweet white peach and melon flavors. Finishes long with a lingering spray of honeysuckle.","White","Riesling","US",66128
"40863","There are lots of orange, pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, honey and spice flavors in this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Arneis and Gewürztraminer. It's brisk in acidity and a little sweet. Try pairing it with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai foods.","White","White Blend","US",40863
"74504","Structured, complex wine that is only just beginning to hint at considerable depth of powerful, rich flavors. The structure is dry, a little lean, but with dense tannins. The fruit, rich plums and stone fruits is just coming through. Age for 10 years.","Port","Port","Portugal",74504
"69922","This shows Merry Edwards' signature of exceptional deliciousness and drinkability, coupled with seemingly neverending depth. Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip. Drink now–2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69922
"74150","Barrel-fermented in neutral oak, this is ready to drink, softly flavorful with yellow apple and other yellow fruits, and a warm, autumnal mouthfeel. Drink now through 2018.","White","Pinot Gris","US",74150
"61991","Aromas of ripe Granny Smith apple and exotic fruit lead to creamy flavors of apricot, beeswax and a hint of pineapple on this delicious white. Just enough fresh acidity balances the rich flavors.","White","Garganega","Italy",61991
"27410","The pear, apple, toast and cinnamon aromas are light and elusive. The flavors are elegant, with the concentration trailing toward the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",27410
"41694","Dark and charred, with black cherry, black licorice and a burnt-oak element on the nose. The palate is thick and firm, with dark berry, herbal notes and some additional burnt char. Finishes with herbal flavors, olive notes and carob. An obvious Chilean Merlot; comes straight from central casting.","Red","Merlot","Chile",41694
"62440","With cedar and tobacco aromas, and vivid black cherry and black currant flavors, this full-bodied red has lots of fruit character and complexity to match its firm tannins and bold texture. A welcome spice component from oak aging starts in the aroma and continues through the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",62440
"23841","The weak nose offers a bit of sour cherry, raspberry and menthol, but just barely. On the palate, there are rounded red fruit flavors and a light earthiness, but again just faint. That said, it does pair nicely with meatloaf or, assuredly, the Hitching Post restaurant's grilled artichoke.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",23841
"61940","Easy and smooth, this shows bright fruit aromas of cherry and cooked raspberry, with soft layers of spice and tobacco at the back. Pair this with pasta and hearty meat sauce.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",61940
"85069","This is a rich and concentrated Grenache, a bit beyond what's varietally familiar, but it's an undeniably luxurious wine. It offers smoky vanilla, fresh leather, black-cherry jam, black licorice and a touch of fudge on the nose. Caramelized plum and olallieberries meet with balsamic fig and milk chocolate on the palate.","Red","Grenache","US",85069
"22724","Grassy, slightly green aromas are fresh and suggest cactus pad. This is easy on the palate, with flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs, such as tarragon and rosemary. A crisp finish is just solid enough to maintain integrity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",22724
"86209","Quite an interesting Chardonnay, in an era when so many are too sweet and extracted. There's plenty of orange and apricot fruit flavor, but also a brilliant streak of minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the overall taste is dry. Really easy to like, with lots of complexity to warrant repeated sipping.","White","Chardonnay","US",86209
"43848","Fresh aromas of citrus, white flowers and exotic fruit are followed by ripe and round flavors of pineapple and preserved lemon. The wine is balanced by good acidity and a clean finish. A dependable everyday wine.","White","White Blend","Greece",43848
"67194","Smooth and full bodied, this wine smells like melted butter, tastes like butterscotch, and feels big and rich on the palate. Apple and pear elements contribute a juicy quality, while the acidity is soft.","White","Chardonnay","US",67194
"17546","Grippy in sizably powerful mountain tannins, this wine is at first difficult to penetrate and will benefit from further cellaring, through 2022. In the shadows lurk full-bodied hits of floral violet and earthy cedar, with a tease of beautifully bittersweet chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",17546
"89390","Starts off with mineral, lemon and anise aromas that develop on the palate into dried spices, ground flint and lime. It's light in body, yet finishes strong, with clean citrus flavors and a lasting sensation of powdery talc.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",89390
"49651","This opens with oak, coconut, toast and camphor aromas while the tightly wound palate offers Marasca cherry, espresso, mocha and star anise flavors. It's still oak-dominated, with raspy tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2021.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",49651
"2881","With light spiciness, this is a full-bodied wine, dominated by tropical fruits. It is rich, rounded, soft, with touches of honey.","White","Pinot Gris","France",2881
"52663","This opens with characteristic aromas of wild berry, wet earth, white truffle and roasted coffee bean. It feels rich and concentrated in the mouth, but never heavy or sticky.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",52663
"59947","Salmon-peach in color this rosé is made from 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec and 10% Pinot Noir, the end result of which is a thirst-quenching array of pineapple and papaya aromas and flavors in a crisp, straightforward package.","Rosé","Rosé","US",59947
"61879","They say the grapes come from Lake, Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. There are some pretty good black-currant and oak aromas, but the flavors are thin and sharp. It’s well made, as you’d expect. Still, the overall impression is lean and austere.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",61879
"45718","Vivid berry flavors drive this medium-bodied, lively and firmly tannic wine. It has good acidity that combines with the fine-grained tannins for an especially tangy mouthfeel.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",45718
"20322","This blend of five Bordeaux grapes has the style and lightly herbal character of a cru Bordeaux. Notes of brambly red fruit and peppery herb combine in a well-balanced wine of medium length, with restrained, lightly earthy tannins.","Red","Merlot","US",20322
"1098","Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish.","Red","Syrah","US",1098
"56094","A 100% varietal wine from the Napa producer, this is sourced from the expansive appellation known as Sonoma Coast. The wine exhibits cooler-climate herbal tendencies against a smooth palate, subtle oak and red fruit. It finishes in sizable tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",56094
"66206","Produced at Quinta do Carmo, this easy and ripe wine is totally ready to drink. With bright red-berry acidity and soft tannins, the blend of Aragonez and Trincadeira is all fruit, finished with acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",66206
"72320","An odd wine, as sweet as pear and peach fruit juice, yet with a strong dose of acidic, green gooseberry. The right salty-sweet foods will balance it.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",72320
"52664","Castello Banfi in Tuscany does a great job with Chardonnay, as evidenced by this wine. It's rich and soft, with bright aromas of peach, citrus, vanilla and savory herb. A pinch of acidity on the finish works beautifully as well.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",52664
"104624","Here's an opulent Chardonnay from the far north of Italy that opens with a thick, creamy bouquet of caramel, apricot and honey. Dry mineral notes and crisp acidity balance out those ripe fruit flavors.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",104624
"96865","This isn't overly flashy or pungent on the nose, but does show some Sauvignon-like notes of green onion and white grapefruit. In the mouth, it's crisp and lean, with flavors of grapefruit and underripe pineapple that hint at wet stone on the finish. Drink now.","White","Vermentino","Australia",96865
"102084","Just hinting at maturity, this rich and stylish wine features finely balanced tannins, a juicy blackberry flavor and fruity ripeness. Using fruit sourced from the small appellation of Canon-Fronsac, on the hill close to Saint-Émilion, this wine is ready to drink and is full of flavor, with concentration on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",102084
"95095","Rather unusual smelling, with exotic spice and blue fruit aromas that aren't cut from the normal cloth. It feels rubbery, with black plum, cumin and licorice flavors. Dark and fruity on the finish, it has warm notes of spice covering every angle. A blend of Garnacha, Monastrell, Samso and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",95095
"47144","With aromas like wood smoke, cardamom and black pepper, this is a beefy, spicy wine. It is full bodied, quite oaky in flavor, and almost tastes like pepper steak in liquid form. Ripe and satisfying dark-fruit flavors kick in and linger on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47144
"98530","Distinct and delicious aromas of crème brûlée with a strawberry glaze pick up some licorice and dark spice when digging deeper. The cranberry fruit's tartness, tannins, and acidity make for a mouth-rinsing wine. Serve with hearty pasta or rich meats.","Red","Sangiovese","US",98530
"52397","This light soft wine is crisp and clean. It moves into the tropical-fruit spectrum of Sauvignon with its ripe mango and peach flavors. There is a fine tang of acidity to this easygoing wine. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",52397
"92718","Easy to mistake this for a Zinfandel, it's so peppery and wild in brambly flavors. Full-bodied and hard in dry, dusty tannins, it displays mulberries, plums, loganberries, blackberries and cola, and is bone dry. Good now with charbroiled steaks and chops.","Red","Malbec","US",92718
"91047","Full dark berry aromas and flavors and classic pepper accents mark this very likeable wine. Cocoa and meaty elements add a bit of complexity not necessarily expected at this price. Kept lively by its brisk, but not sharp acidity, it finishes peppery with a tart-sweet profile.  This straightforward, delicious wine exemplifies how competitive California can still be, despite the trend to priciness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91047
"11872","Pure fruitiness, this wine is full of black currant flavors and a stalky, dusty texture. Without wood aging, it has acidity, fruitiness and some dry tannins. Drink from the end of 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",11872
"105195","A perennial winner, Grande Garrigue is a medium- to full-bodied wine with supple tannins and ample cherry fruit. This vintage shows a hint of asphalt upfront, then dark tones of earth and chocolate on the velvety finish. Drink now–2022.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",105195
"15219","Honest, citrusy aromas are simple and nice, while the palate is spritzy, zesty and tastes mildly sweet but also correct with mango, lime, apple and orange flavors. Clean, fun and leaning toward sweet. A good value white to drink immediately.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",15219
"17760","A sumptuous wine, rich in bright red fruits, with a structure and depth of flavor to match. The wine is gorgeously ripe, opening its heart quickly. Acidity, bitter chocolate and dark cherries go with the tannic core to promise long aging.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",17760
"56766","Sturdy on the nose, this has cherry and red berry aromas. The palate is juicy, lively and fun, with crisp, focused red-plum and cassis flavors. Easy to quaff.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",56766
"32479","A steely edge sharpens this perfumed, blossomy Riesling full of ripe white peach and apricot flavors. Dry in style, it's rich and weighty on the palate with a penetrating, powerful finish. Drinks beautifully now, but likely to improve through at least 2021.","White","Riesling","Germany",32479
"22497","This small-production wine is dense in currant and licorice tones, both generous and lengthy on the palate. Firm tannins lend solid structure, with ample acidity to balance. A clove flavor adds depth to the fruit and lingers on the enduiring finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22497
"52852","Caramel and soft berry fruits characterize this pleasant and fresh wine. It has flavors of red berries along with vanilla  to round it out. Easy Pinot, drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",52852
"28585","A new addition to the winery's lineup, this wine opens with aromas of underbrush, dark raspberries and red licorice. The palate shows an exquisite sense of restraint and polish along with a lengthy finish that kicks it up a notch. It's a very pretty, thoroughly beguiling wine.","Red","Syrah","US",28585
"60203","An enticing fragrance of wildflower, peach blossom, berry and a hint of white pepper lead the nose. The lively, linear palate offers green apple, pear and toasted almond alongside vibrant acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",60203
"1295","A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1295
"75518","Pieluni Riserva is a superdense and rich expression of Montepulciano that could use another 3–5 years of aging. Oak spice aromas (the wine aged in French barrique for 18 months) are evident and will relax with time, ulimately revealing black fruit, cassis and sweet cinnamon spice.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",75518
"73052","There sure is a lot of ripe flavor in this Pinot, which swamps the tastebuds with raspberries, cherries, vanilla and sweet oak. It's basically a dry wine, with smooth tannins, but it is deficient in acidity. That steals some liveliness, and makes the richness taste flat.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73052
"45950","This ambitious blend of 60% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot, 15% Petite Sirah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon largely succeeds, with aromas of tight blueberries, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of crushed peppercorn. The fruit-driven palate is dense with blueberry, tart boysenberry and a dusting of cocoa.","Red","Red Blend","US",45950
"8908","A clear choice for those who prefer mineral expression over fruit character, this Pinot opens with notes of seasoned leather, tar and cigarette tobacco. The concentrated palate is dense; notes of smoke lead to a long, earthy finish shot through with drying tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",8908
"41069","The Santa Cruz producer Bargetto ventures into Lodi to make this old-vine Zin and unfortunately something gets lost in translation. The wine comes off a little bitter, like blackberries picked too soon.","Red","Zinfandel","US",41069
"58522","Rich without being heavy, this wine offers bright cherry and strawberry, followed by pretty floral components and just a tiny dose of cinnamon. Balanced and not overdone in oak, it's enjoyable and ready for the table.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58522
"54894","Light and oxidative, with soft, toasty buttery flavors. The fruit is hidden behind all the buttered popcorn flavors. It's drinking well enough at the moment, but aging very quickly.","White","Chardonnay","US",54894
"51910","A little too soft for aging, but ultra-refined, with complex cherry, red currant, balsam, cola and mushroom flavors. It's very dry and ready to drink now, despite some hard tannins.","Red","Merlot","US",51910
"93564","Light-bodied and refreshing, this wine leads with fresh cucumber aromas then opens crisp grapefruit and lemon flavors that feel lively on the palate.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",93564
"1364","This wine is light in tannins and ripe in fruit, with a delicious red-berry character. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",1364
"41029","For an icewine, this is ultra-sweet. 2003 was a tough year for icewine, because there was not enough autumn mist, but the fruit was very ripe. This shows in the intense honey and burnt toffee flavors here, the acidity a mere hint.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",41029
"50126","Aromas of jammy red raspberries, cranberries, dried herbs and peppery spices are followed by a silky soft palate that is elegantly styled and well-balanced. Fruit tones blend with savory flavors, with coffee notes providing accents. A peppery, meaty finish rounds it out and keeps the attention high.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",50126
"72057","This blend of Garganega and 10% Trebbiano di Soave shows a bright, luminous straw color, fresh aromas of citrus, stone fruit and blanched almond. It delivers a blast of lively tonic freshness on the finish.","White","Garganega","Italy",72057
"66947","This is one of the more interesting rosés of the vintage, in part because it is almost as hay-colored as a white wine and doesn't adhere to the standard pink profile. Aromas of crushed Marcona almonds, sea salt and oak smoke show on the nose, and the acid-driven palate continues that nutty and smokey drive. It's intriguing and unique, though not particularly pink.","Rosé","Rosé","US",66947
"81258","Whiffs of pine fronds and green melon rinds lend a brisk, tonic feel to this off-dry Riesling. It's racy and fresh with acidity, but wraps up briskly and without a trace.","White","Riesling","Germany",81258
"28614","This blend of Grenache and Cinsault comes from the small cru area of La Londe. Produced from organic grapes, it is pale in color, although rich in texture and with touches of white peach and strawberry. With its pepper and tangy texture it is a style of rosé that could well age. Drink from 2018.","Rosé","Rosé","France",28614
"61338","Elegant and almost ethereal, this wine is tantalizing and irresistible. It shows sophistication, from the mysterious, earthy bouquet to the complex, well-aged brioche and peach flavors, as well as the almost gentle texture and refined finish. While full bodied, the wine has great balance, as all the tasty components join together to weave their magic.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","US",61338
"34527","Plum and berry aromas are leathery and solid. This feels a bit wiry, but full of energy and sharp acidity. Loamy plum and blackberry flavors are boosted by tartartic acidity, while mild herb notes fade on the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",34527
"44541","The leathery red-berry aromas are a tad stretched and tight but still good. This feels zesty, snappy and alert in the mouth, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum and tangy cherry tomato. The hickory spice imparted from 24 months of oak aging shows up on the finish along with licorice.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",44541
"69687","A lot of this Cabernet-Merlot-Syrah-Cab Franc blend is produced, and for the money it gives you plenty of enjoyment. Soft raspberry fruit seems loaded with oak-derived flavors. Toast, vanilla, bare wood, even a streak of cola come through. The wine drinks far more mature than the recent vintage, so drink up.","Red","Red Blend","US",69687
"59696","Red currant and plump red berries are lifted by hibiscus and violet notes on the nose of this wine by Matt Brain and Josh Baker. It's quite ripe with plum, pomegranate and cherry fruit on the palate, but also relatively light in texture. Elegantly complex, it also discloses pipe smoke and eucalyptus elements.","Red","Grenache","US",59696
"40567","Lush richness and velvety concentration set this wine apart from most Chianti Classico. The blend includes 15% Merlot (which is a lot) and you can really taste spice, chocolate fudge and black cherry. Determined oak notes reveal themselves in the mouth and add to the wine's overall richness.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",40567
"5721","This wine is packed with flavor from the ripe blend of Shiraz, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional. Its berry fruits and balanced acidity give the wine an easy, juicy character. The gentle tannins are easily integrated with the fruit. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",5721
"64427","Savory whiffs of pressed apple and pear open to brighter, juicier flavors of yellow peach, watermelon and berry in this unusually rose-tinted Viognier. It's quite fruity on the palate with sunny acidity and a brisk citrusy finish.","White","Viognier","US",64427
"102548","Defines a certain style of Sauvignon Blanc, namely the bone-dry, ultracrisp version whose firm structure frames a bright, zesty taste. The flavors are of lemons, limes, grapefruits, figs, white pepper and minerals, with a rich grassiness. This Loire-like wine is so versatile, you can have it with almost anything.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",102548
"20084","A ripe, smooth, smoky wine, in which the fruit is dense, almost sweetly rich. Spicy wood is a strong component, going right above the berry fruit flavors. This is an immediate, fruity, ready-to-drink wine.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",20084
"76141","This is an aromatic, balanced and smooth wine. With its poise between acidity, fragrant white fruits and touch of toast, it has concentration and richness. On the dry side of brut, it's crisp and delicate on the one hand and intense on the other. Drink now.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",76141
"98754","With just over 75% of the fruit coming from Seven Hills and the rest from the winery's young Ferguson vineyard, this wine offers a lot of enjoyment. Aromas suggest herb, cocoa, mineral and an assortment of blue fruit. The flavors are simultaneously luscious yet restrained, backed by firm tannins that should benefit from additional time in the bottle.","Red","Merlot","US",98754
"19249","Sweet aromas of berry pastry and black licorice are moderately convincing, while the palate is reduced and chunky, with thick but dull prune and roasted berry flavors. The finish is more of the same: baked fruit flavors and sweet.","Red","Syrah","Chile",19249
"86657","This crisp, tangy and refreshing wine has lemon and green-apple aromas, bright citrus flavors, medium body and a lean texture, due mostly to the generous acidity. Raw oysters on the half shell, garlic shrimp and goat-cheese toasts come to mind as good pairings.","White","Viognier","US",86657
"30927","Underbrush, menthol, dark berry and allspice aromas take shape in the glass. The simple palate, which has a slightly fizzy character, offers fleshy black cherry, overripe plum and soft acidity alongside buffed tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",30927
"21048","A forest-like earthiness mingles with yeasty baked bread aromas in this soft, well-built Mourvèdre- and Petite Sirah-dominant field blend. Fig, black pepper and tar flavors show through a tightly knit foundation of powerful tannin and texture, seasoned with Asian spice.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",21048
"87181","For a huge-volume wine, it's what we'd expect. Controlled oak results in aromas of coffee, vanilla, marshmallow and resin in addition to cassis and cherry, while the palate offers generic fruit flavors as well as vanilla and herbal notes. A bit puckery and scratchy, but keep in mind that annual production tops 1.3 million cases.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",87181
"84458","A standout among the winery's vineyard designates, this puts ripe raspberry jam and cherry-pie fruit front and center. There's a dollop of balsamic and chocolate as well. Native yeast fermentation may have contributed to the unusual flavors of toasted peanuts that linger in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84458
"46435","Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco, allspice and mocha unfold in the glass along with a note of tilled earth. The opulent palate offers blackberry extract, dried plum, licorice and chocolate while velvety tannins provide support and give it a smooth texture. Drink through 2019.","Red","Syrah","Italy",46435
"88770","Underbrush, red berry, scorched earth and dark spice aromas emerge in the glass. The structured, chewy palate offers mature black cherry, clove, ground pepper and star anise set in a firm framework of fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",88770
"69277","Aged 40 months in French and Russian oak, this leads with green herb, bell pepper, vanilla, cherry and spice aromas and follows through with ripe black cherry flavors. The nose and palate seem disconnected, the green notes unusual for the appellation and vintage.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",69277
"81173","Dark fruits and graceful highlights of black tea, citrus oil, tobacco and mocha make this an endlessly fascinating wine with impressive complexity. Give it extended breathing time and it rewards you with layer after layer of silky fruit, leaf and spice. This is a 20-year wine, but may be enjoyed immediately with ample airing.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81173
"31323","Spring blossoms and lemon zest lend a fresh exuberance to this effortlessly elegant kabinett. Just a shade off dry, it's juicy with tangerine, honeydew and yellow peach flavors, but vibrant, with bright streaks of Meyer-lemon acidity.","White","Riesling","Germany",31323
"15937","This limited-production Chardonnay has the scents and flavors of just-baked, well-buttered biscuits. The fruit is a mix of peaches and pears, but the barrel influences—fermentation was done in 20% new French oak—have not quite settled into a seamless whole. That raw edge should smooth out with further time in bottle.","White","Chardonnay","US",15937
"28855","Front-loaded with black cherry and blackberry jam flavors, this Merlot has thick tannins and good acidity. It's a simple wine, but easy to drink with everyday fare, like burgers and tacos.","Red","Merlot","US",28855
"79804","Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose, but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side, as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid.","Red","Merlot","Argentina",79804
"97284","Equal parts Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine offers aromas of kiwi, spice and citrus that provide nuance and appeal. It's textured and full in feel, stretching out on the finish.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","US",97284
"53837","The best thing about this wine is the acidity. It's so bright and mouthwatering, it provides a perfect balance to jammy citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors. Honeyed on the palate, it's a good partner for Cantonese and Vietnamese fare.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",53837
"13402","Good Cab, maybe a touch herbal and light, but very solid. Early aromas of cola, leather and blackberry show some herbal, green notes. But the tomato leaf character is not dominant or unappealing, thus in the end this displays classic Chilean Cabernet qualities on a light, agile frame. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",13402
"28952","Scents of mixed forest berries, red plum, fresh thyme and bay laurel lead the bouquet of this wine, and carry though to the juicy palate. Approachable and enjoyable now, with ripe fruit flavors and a hint of chocolate that stays through the medium-length finish. 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot. Mevushal.","Red","Red Blend","Israel",28952
"50801","In much the same mold as its companion, the ghost in the machine Red, this is almost all Syrah, with a bit more bite and focus. Purple plum fruit glides smoothly into a lightly toasty finish. A fine every day red with plenty of flavor.","Red","Red Blend","US",50801
"84184","This Pinot is marked with candied raspberry and cherry flavors, along with oaky vanilla and toast notes. It finishes rather soft.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84184
"56388","Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.","Red","Syrah","US",56388
"75492","Green pepper and tobacco aromas signal some of the sour fruit that appears on the palate. Tastes of beets and pie cherries and an oaky, disparate finish doesn't do much to shape things up. Too sour and scattered.","Red","Syrah","France",75492
"45857","The wine is soft, ripe and fruity with fine tannins and plenty of red-berry fruit flavors. Structured and spicy, it will develop well into a concentrated ripe wine. Jean-Michel Baudet's Blaye estate vineyards were the first to be certified sustainable by Terra Vitis. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",45857
"52604","This wine has an almost sweet aroma of ripe plums and cherries, followed by a vivid fruity flavor that's fresh, dry and accented with black pepper and clove. Showing great balance from fine tannins and good acidity and vibrant but not heavy flavor, it will be a versatile and crowd-pleasing pour.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",52604
"36930","Tropical on the nose with lots of melon, guava and pineapple, this is reminiscent of fruit cocktail on both the nose and palate. Despite it's juicy profile, however, it lacks in intensity, but a clean minerality and bright, citrusy acidity keep it refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",36930
"42460","The flint soil behind this wine gives it a stony, smoky character that is allied to the mineral texture. It's a ripe wine, still young with pure fruit and an intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",42460
"76062","There's no mistaking the variety, with aromas of sarsaparilla, underbrush and cherry, though a rubber-tire note provides some distraction. The cherry, strawberry and cranberry flavors show good concentration, though they seem a bit clunky at times.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",76062
"101174","Rustic and tightly wound in tannin and oak, this shows reduced qualities and a core of big-boned concentration.It offers more tobacco and tea than acidity and fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101174
"6976","Somewhat soft and jammy. While it's certainly delicious, this 100% Cabernet needs greater structure and complexity to add value to the sweet blackberries, cherries and chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",6976
"77795","This is a stunner because it shows such minerally depth, which many strive for but few achieve on a pink wine. The classic shade of pink gives way to bubblegum, lime juice, orange rind and smashed raspberry aromas. The zesty, vibrant lime juice acidity cuts right through plum fruit, but it's the graphite and chalky tension that wins the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",77795
"45225","This is a Rhône blend based on Syrah and Grenache. It's super-fruity, with a blast of blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate that taste like they were baked into a tart, and the texture is soft and velvety. Drink now.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",45225
"16243","Almost citrusy aromas of candied berry are jammy and unconvincing. The mouth is narrow and pinched in feel, with herbal, wiry berry flavors that finish minty and hot.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",16243
"82252","This vineyard has done well in warm years such as 2008, but in the chilly 2011 vintage, it's tart with acidity. A cranberry bite dominates all else, from the red currant flavors to the spicy, vanilla-accented oak from barrels.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",82252
"51677","The Brunate cru, with denser soils, is known for meatier, more structured wines. This Barolo offers elegance, power and complexity with lingering aromas of exotic spice, black fruit and root beer. It's also exceptionally bright and lively in the mouth and would pair with a hearty wintery dish such as beef Bourguignon.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",51677
"90639","Even the richest, spiciest wines from Rieflé-Landmann retain freshness. So this hugely spicy wine still has a crisp element that gives it a great lift. It's structured with some dryness at the end as a contrast to the more honeyed opening. Drink from 2018.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",90639
"41214","The producer blends 57% Chardonnay from the Maldonado Vineyard with 39% Sauvignon Blanc and 4% Viognier for this fresh, floral white. On the palate, apple and lemon flavors are buttressed by a core of laser-like acidity. A fresh pear note lasts long into the finish, proving the wine's ability to be both creamy and crisp.","White","White Blend","US",41214
"60815","A lighter, elegant style of Pinot Noir, dry and silky, with cherryskin, tobacco, cola and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into furry tannins. This is a good price. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60815
"13481","Ripe and juicy, this wine is soft, generous and full of rich, while very fresh fruits. It has black-currant acidity, a touch of spice and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",13481
"79879","A lovely floral streak adds interest to the bright red-berry and ripe rhubarb aromas. Cherry-skin and rich strawberry flavors fill the palate and remain through the clean finish. Light weight with soft tannins and an easy demeanor.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",79879
"99405","A salty hint of yeast and fresh, green apple and pear appear on the nose. The slender palate is enlivened by lemon brightness and slight spritz. Cheeky green fruit and white pepper tingle everywhere, making for an easy but refreshing drink.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",99405
"41887","A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",41887
"38732","Made by Angelo Gaja at his estate in coastal Tuscany, this blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of plum, spice and warm toasted notes. The structured, elegant palate delivers restrained black currant and black cherry accented with notes of black pepper and coffee alongside polished tannins. It's still young and a bit nervous, so give it time to develop its potential. Drink 2015–2030.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",38732
"15354","From cellars in the heart of the village of Pouilly-sur-Loire, the seventh generation of the Masson family produces this classic Pouilly Fumé, structured and full of ripe fruits. It is a wine for aging, with its tense minerality and tight texture that parallel the fruitiness. Wait until 2016.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",15354
"87468","They left a lot of sweetness in this steel-fermented Pinot Grigio, so if you like that sugary edge, this one's for you. The flavors are of vibrantly ripe tangerines, pineapples and fresh green apples.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",87468
"2773","This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",2773
"63140","So rich and soft with chocolate, raspberry and vanilla flavors, this wine is better sipped by itself than with food. The alcohol level is enormously high, giving this Cabernet the headiness of a Port.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63140
"39348","Light red-cherry aromas meet with wild sagebrush and graphite on the light and easy nose of this wine from a family vineyard that recently came under new management. The palate offers cranberry juice lifted by crushed thyme and anise.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",39348
"51739","Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.","White","Albariño","Spain",51739
"23238","Another Fiddletown beauty, this one is pungent in blackberry and exhilarating pepper and clove. Aromatic, structured and electric with equal parts acidity and stony minerality, this wine has a long-lingering finish of gorgeous brambly fruit.","Red","Zinfandel","US",23238
"55289","Here's a rich Chardonnay notable for plenty of fruit, and also for brisk acidity. It's creamy smooth, with pineapple, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that are almost sweet in the finish, but pull back in favor of minerality.","White","Chardonnay","US",55289
"40542","Aromas of whole green pepper, hot spice, cherry and baking spice are followed by lighter styled, tart, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors.","Red","Carmenère","US",40542
"73224","A rich, candied Pinot Noir, filled with raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors. It's a bit simple, but deliciously so, with a crisply silky texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73224
"58335","A serious wine that needs aging, this is full and ripe while also having a steely edge to it. Very perfumed, floral and strongly textured, this is an impressive wine that does need extended aging. Drink from 2016.","White","Riesling","France",58335
"56435","Aromas of vanilla extract, cinnamon, fennel and fruit leather predominate on this Syrah and Merlot-dominant blend. The palate shows a surprising amount of richness considering the coolness of the vintage, with baking-spice flavors carrying through the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",56435
"49337","Bright and high in acidity, this has a lively cherry flavor, plus a layering of earthy mushroom. It's silky from start to finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49337
"69691","This simple wine has aromas that recall red berries, espresso and toast. The palate is on the lean side, displaying notes of clove, cinnamon and coffee bean. Pair it with hearty first courses, like pasta topped with ragù.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",69691
"1036","Cameron Hughes bottles dozens of wines from California growers, and now he's expanded to include Rioja and Campo de Borja in Spain along with South Africa. This wine is made in the full-throttled, modern style. There's copious oak, toast and darkness on the bouquet, and then full-bodied black plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Quite a bulky, oaky style, but also one endowed with chocolate, nuttiness and depth.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",1036
"103294","Tastes both underripe and overripe at the same time, with some polished cherry flavors in the middle. Lots of acidity makes it sour. A dry, somewhat rustic wine that rich meats and cheeses will help fatten.","Red","Malbec","US",103294
"96093","A gorgeous wine, lush and refined from the first sniff to the last swallow. Rose petals, cotton candy, chocolate-covered cherries—it's a date in a bottle. As the wine rolls across the palate it seems to gain depth and detail, while keeping the exceptionally pretty fruit flavors front and center. Silky and lightly spicy, with cinnamon, toast, mocha and tobacco highlights.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96093
"9881","A lightly funky whiff of the chicken yard underlies the aromatics, but for most tasters it will be an asset, as it does not block the pretty cherry fruit. These forward, appealing cherry flavors, matched to natural acidity and lengthened with that whiff of funk, make for a delicious and value-priced effort.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9881
"94902","Plenty of ripe black currant, licorice and cedar flavors in this dry, full-bodied young Cabernet. It feels luxurious in the mouth, with a depth and spicy finish that are notable. Drink by 2017.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",94902
"30455","This soft wine shows a rounded character. It's balanced, with acidity giving a supporting freshness and texture to the full, rich creaminess. Full in the mouth and dense, it could age further. Drink from 2015.","White","White Blend","France",30455
"24697","Heady alcohol gives this Zin a jalapeño pepper heat that packs a real punch when combined with wild berry jam, dried currant and chocolate flavors. The tannins are thick and smooth and the finish rich with glycerine. Great with barbecued beef or short ribs.","Red","Zinfandel","US",24697
"49484","In general, we love Felluga's wines. So why the modest score on the winery's top white? One simple word: oak. With this wine's buttery, oaky aromas and flavors of peach, cinnamon and brown sugar, it could pass for a decent Chardonnay. But this blend of Tocai Friulano, Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon Blanc from a great producer should do so much more.","White","White Blend","Italy",49484
"77110","A blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Mourvèdre, this is an invitingly juicy and spicy rosé, packed with strawberry-mint and pomegranate flavors and a long, savory finish. It's a great introduction to this winery and its talent for creating Rhône-inspired wines.","Rosé","Rosé","US",77110
"30846","A big, in your face Zin, with concentrated blackberry jam, currant and espresso flavors along with some overripe raisin and prune notes. High alcohol gives a burn to the palate and the tannins are bitter. Drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",30846
"9205","Despite being barrel fermented and matured, this Condrieu retains a remarkable amount of varietal character in its flamboyantly floral and spicy aromas. It's full bodied, broad and richly textured, yet avoids any sense of heaviness, finishing on hints of honey and white pepper. Drink now–2020.","White","Viognier","France",9205
"87166","This stalky, firmly tannic wine is still developing. Dominated by Merlot, it has black currant fruits in the background with acidity and crispness. Give this structured wine another few years and drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",87166
"39097","This shows earthy aromas of forest floor, plum and leather, with intense notes of bell pepper and whiffs of red currant, all of which carry through to the savory palate. The fresh acidity makes it a perfect match for mildly seasoned cheeses or grilled burgers. Siena Imports, Barsotti Wines.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",39097
"46858","A mix of Pommard and 667 clones, this spent 16 months in 18% new French oak. By no means oaky in flavor, it balances highlights of chocolate and baking spices with plenty of pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. There's a dusting of dried herbs as it rolls into a palate-pleasing finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46858
"44422","The wine is all about fresh fruit. Blackberry fruit jumps from the glass with its light tannins and lively acidity. The structure, with just a touch of dryness, is just right to support the boisterous fruit. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",44422
"8073","This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.","White","Riesling","Germany",8073
"38963","This offers much of the intensity of Amarone with some of the easy-drinking appeal of Valpolicella. Twists of ripe cherry and dried ginger lend it extra personality.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",38963
"50140","Rustic smelling, this has a leafy scent and red fruit aromas akin to cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is tight, jumpy and alert, and the flavors of cassis and plum set up a rugged, scratchy finish, with notes of carob, vanilla and coffee.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",50140
"4334","From a p of Sonoma Mountain exposed to the Petaluma Gap, this wine is spicy in cinnamon and cola, its oak profile reduced and intense. Roses and cherries provide the floral and the fruit around deeper, darker tendencies into Asian spice and black tea. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4334
"92809","This is a richly ripe 2009 Pouilly Fumé. It steers right to the tropical fruit end of the spectrum while not losing sight of a more textured mineral character. It is rich and could age for 1–2 years and more.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",92809
"101218","Lightly toasted aromas of apple and lime are mellow. This feels fresh and citrusy, with lime, orange and tropical fruit flavors. A steady, sturdy finish comes with a mild salty note of sea brine.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",101218
"89063","With its light prickle, this off-dry wine has a candied flavor, a tangy texture and a crisp, light aftertaste. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",89063
"2782","This is a beautifully perfumed wine, ripe with black fruits and generous with its tannins and acidity. It comes from a one-acre parcel called Le Vivier which has 70-year-old vines. It is concentrated, dense and with aging potential. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",2782
"80543","This is a dense, complete wine with good Garnacha character and generous berry, spice, char and minty aromas and flavors. Rubbery tannins are fair and just, while flavors of grilled meat and baked plum finish oaky, with a slightly raw feel.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",80543
"83369","Leather, menthol, dark-skinned berry and light toast aromas slowly come together on this fresh, polished wine. The lithe, straightforward palate offers wild cherry, anise, orange peel and a hint of coffee while fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provide the framework.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",83369
"19894","Pretty scents show pure varietal character, with the accent on fresh berries and sweet herb. Flavors follow suit, with well-managed, ripe and smooth tannins. A medium-bodied wine drinking well right now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19894
"66437","Sirmian is a beautiful Pinot Bianco that really shows true varietal characteristics. The subdued bouquet delivers pear, stone fruit and crushed mineral. The mouthfeel is creamy, rich and ends with waxy flavors of lemon and Golden Delicious apple.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",66437
"67907","This wine is already soft, warm and attractive. With blackberry fruit, ripe tannins and a crisp acidity at the end, it shows a generous nature. Drink from 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",67907
"92130","This ambitious project delivers another great wine with plenty of deliciousness to substantiate its crazy endeavor to plant grapes on a windswept island. Baked red plum, cola and cinnamon aromas lead into an acid-driven palate full of ripe yet tangy cranberry fruit and a strong sagebrush quality.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92130
"27085","Full-bodied and broad in the mouth, this Marsanne delivers aromas of singed marshmallow, ripe melon and pear. Flavors follow in a similar vein, adding a bit of citrus on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",27085
"100856","This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration. It is a very fine wine, packed with black plum and berry fruits and balanced richness. Don't let the great fruit deceive: this is a wine for the serious long term. Drink from 2028.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",100856
"42393","Hefty tannins are resolved into a velvety texture by the intense fruit and cedar flavors in this full-bodied, beautifully made wine. Notes like blueberry, dark chocolate and cocoa powder coat the palate and linger on the finish. It's thick and tannic in mouthfeel, but those tannins feel rounded and generous.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",42393
"9173","Baked loamy berry aromas come with a reedy rooty note of licorice. This feels good but jammy and a touch flat. Jammy raspberry, plum and currant flavors finish spicy and lightly herbal. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",9173
"92600","Iron-laced beef aromas meet boysenberry and wet stone on the nose of this widely available and smartly priced wine from the historic producer. Red cherry fruit shows on the palate along with a touch of turned earth, making for a pleasant yet simple sip.","Red","Merlot","US",92600
"94148","Deeply flavored, this impressive Syrah advances the red wine cause in Temecula. It's a big, powerful wine, rich in blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, with a peppery, chocolate, anise and grilled meat finish. Really fine now, but also packed with young, astringent tannins, it's a wine to decant, or cellar for up to five years.","Red","Syrah","US",94148
"78681","The wine is typically light and fruity, although a year from the harvest it has lost its total freshness and filled out. It is fruity with apples and zingy citrus that are softening and becoming more rich. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",78681
"88861","A wood-aged wine from the heart of the Dão, it has tannins, a tense mineral structure and layer after layer of black currant fruit and acidity. Dark and brooding at this stage, it needs to age for several years. Drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",88861
"57018","This blend of fruit from Ciel du Cheval (85%) and Force Majeure vineyards was fermented in concrete before aging in three- to seven-year-old oak barrels. It's dazzling in feel, with rich, supple, focused cranberry and cherry flavors that lead to a tart, drawn-out finish.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",57018
"98831","This has green apple and creamed pear flavors, with a lively, buoyant texture. It's worth aging for a few more months. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",98831
"69944","With its intense black color and perfumed aromas, this is a superb wine. The palate is firm, solid, still tannic, with the fruit just coming into balance. Nineteen months of wood aging has rounded the wine without dominating. Give this seriously ageworthy wine 5–6 years.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",69944
"14592","In general, Eola Hills Pinots lean more to the peppery and herbal side of the line, compared with pricier AVAs in Yamhill county. This well-made wine shows good color and concentration, and it's ripe enough that the herbaceousness is a feature, if not entirely an asset. There's a nice lift to the midpalate, which leaves a residual impression that finishes a bit vinegary, as the wine winds down into flavors of black olive and herb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14592
"6741","One of Brancott's best Sauvignons in recent memory, the 2008 B is intensely herbal on the nose, featuring green tomatoes and bell pepper, but only mildly vegetal on the palate--well within the bounds of acceptable varietal character. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with a long, mouth-tingling finish. Try with sole Basquaise.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",6741
"79951","This is a very distinct and unique Syrah, starting with subdued black fruit, minty chocolate, crushed pepper and grapeseed aromas. The palate is light and savory in style, with pepper, tar, roasted meat and burnt sugar flavors that finish with a cocoa and coffee touch.","Red","Syrah","US",79951
"90979","This blend of 42% Grenache, 37% Mourvèdre, 16% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah offers plum and mulberry aromas, with touches of thyme and sage. The palate delivers a similar range of dried fruit and wild herb flavors, showing dark strawberry and plenty of savory garrigue.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",90979
"57153","Punchy hibiscus and pomegranate notes mix with crushed black rocks and rose petals on the nose of this very reliable every-day drinker. The palate is earthy and herbal in character, with flavors of bay leaf, camphor, dried mint, pine sap and tangy cranberry juice making it very food-friendly.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57153
"73360","A bit voluptuous in style, this bold, round Chardonnay accents fresh apple and pear with slick tones of buttered popcorn and toast. It's rich and silky in mouthfeel with a lingering kiss of warmth on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",73360
"102854","On first take, this smells high-toned and much like pine and sweat. With time, out come flavors of baking spices, vanilla, lychee, apricot and honeydew melon. On the finish, this is fresh, with flavors of vanilla and botrytis. Drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","Chile",102854
"34724","Aromas of green apple and orchard blossom are brightened by lemon zest on the nose. The broad palate brings ample weight, balanced by lemony acidity, with ripe melon and peach leading the way.","White","Chardonnay","US",34724
"5052","Light while also intense with good acidity and unctuous honey flavors, this is already a delicious wine, even though it is young. Ripe orange and lemon go with the honey to give a fine wine that could be drunk now, although that would be a shame. It would be much better to wait until 2017. With just over 200 acres of vines, Quarts de Chaume is a tiny enclave in the Layon Valley.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",5052
"71073","From the northern end of the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation, this wine is ripe, floral and supple in texture. It has crisp red fruit and vibrant acidity, underpinned by ripe tannins. Developing quickly, it will be ready to drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",71073
"13650","Rose, violet, red berry, cake spice and aniseed are some of the aromas you'll find on this delicious Barolo. On the balanced palate, notes of tobacco, licorice, clove and dried herb accent the juicy cherry-berry core. Ripe, firm tannins and fresh acidity provide structure.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",13650
"26756","Here's a pretty Pinot, direct and appealing for its range of fruit. Shows raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, uplifted by bright acidity. Drink it now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26756
"56834","Aromas of roasted almond, wild flower and a whiff of candied cherry lead the way on this blend of 62% Chardonnay and 38% Pinot Nero. The palate delivers mature yellow apple and stone fruit alongside a note of roasted walnut.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",56834
"34996","This is 100% Syrah from the Seven Hills vineyard, a firm and tannic effort with dark, rich flavors. Cassis, black pepper, coffee grounds and gravelly mineral flavors combine in a muscular wine with big bones and a finishing lick of citrus.","Red","Syrah","US",34996
"48049","Full and ripe, this wine also has good acidity that gives a lively edge to the yellow-fruit flavors. Along with the peach and apricot fruits, it presents refreshing crispness. The aftertaste delivers a great lift of acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",48049
"24039","This wine offers soft, malleable red berry, vanilla and marshmallow flavors, making for a ripe, perceptibly sweet experience. Full bodied and densely packed in mellow tannin and oak, it includes a notable hint of peppercorn, and will go well with something similarly appointed, like pepper steak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",24039
"99418","Aromas of red berry, blue flower and tilled soil lead the way on this young elegant wine. The fresh tightly wound palate shows cherry, licorice, sage and an iron note set against close-knit tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to come around. Drink 2020–2031.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",99418
"15710","A unique personality reveals itself through the subtle but exotic aromas, rich texture and vivid but not overripe fruit flavors. It tastes and feels substantial and full bodied. Vivid acidity buoys up everything and helps the finish linger. A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne, Viognier and Picpoul Blanc, it tastes like it will improve with age. Best now through 2018.","White","White Blend","US",15710
"16738","Light pink in color, this wine offers aromas of strawberry, bubblegum, cherry and melon. It drinks off dry, with mouthwatering fruit flavors.","White","Pinot Gris","US",16738
"53691","Pronounced wood and toast notes open this rich, oaky Chardonnay. The palate boasts bright lemon and caramel-apple flavors, but hints of unripe stems and leaves distract.","White","Chardonnay","US",53691
"55458","This Randall Grahm wine, which also includes 9% Mourvèdre and 2% Syrah, hits the nose with tight raspberry juice, hibiscus, cola and iron aromas, proving tight and mineral-driven. Pencil lead leads the lighter palate, which also shows brisk pomegranate, black and white pepper and a menthol-like Sichuan-peppercorn sensation on the finish. It's a tremendous wine for the price.","Red","Grenache","US",55458
"79407","In this cool vintage the Celilo vineyard was not able to supply enough fruit for a single vineyard Chardonnay, so the blend includes grapes from Del Rio in southern Oregon. It's a fine mix, spicy and sharp, loaded with citrus and semi-tropical fruit. Bright acidity, hints of toast, and a lick of lime all combine to make a delicious and lingering finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",79407
"101528","This blend of 90% Viura and 10% Malvasia gives off scents of saline and pool water along with apple, citrus and green herb notes. The palate is zesty and high in acid, leaving a clipped feel and flavors of lime, pineapple and green apple. It's nicely built but modest in its overall expression.","White","White Blend","Spain",101528
"87905","This is a gently spicy wine with notes of ginger and cinnamon as well as ripe tropical fruits. It is not a complex wine, but very approachable even at this stage and touched with some acidity on the finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",87905
"44246","Fresh, minerally lime aromas set up a zesty palate with lemon-lime, pineapple and apple flavors. There's nothing complicated about this snappy white, which finishes with some bitterness and lasting acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",44246
"39689","From Rick Longoria's own vineyard comes this high-toned, focused bottling showing Asian pear juice, hot toast and apple blossom on the stonefruit-driven nose. There is steel structure on the sip, which fresh with more fruity pear elements, but also bound to a chipped-slate minerality.","White","Chardonnay","US",39689
"91907","There's some complexity to this Zin despite the fact that it's high in alcohol. The berry-cherry fruit is restrained, exhibiting all kinds of earthy and mineral notes.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91907
"103632","A pale copper-pink color in the glass, this is a bright and fruit-forward wine, with upfront notes of peach, yellow melon, ripe berry and pink florals. Flavors of white peach and cherry follow through to the lightweight palate, with lively acidity that lends refreshment to the close. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",103632
"98392","Ripe earthy berry aromas are supported by more than enough oak and sawdust. Following the nose like a map, this Malbec from San Rafael feels resiny. A mix of toasty spicy oak-based flavors blends well with boysenberry and salty notes, while this finishes full and with a draping of toasty blackened oak.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",98392
"105248","This wine brings aromas of toast, dried herbs, dark raspberries and cranberries. It's silky in texture, with the concentration a bit wanting. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but it still provides enjoyment.","Red","Sangiovese","US",105248
"55852","This blend of four varieties boasts notes of almond skin, orange zest and honeydew melon in a full-bodied, slightly warm wine. The long finish shows ample concentration and a hint of bitterness.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",55852
"94671","Soft blackberry, cinnamon and pepper aromas lead flavors of juicy berry and savory spice in this Merlot from Bulgaria. Good tannins and structure give the wine ageability, which will also temper its oaky character. Overall, an impressive effort from an emerging region.","Red","Merlot","Bulgaria",94671
"60044","This thick, and darkly concentrated Barolo offers a wide range of aromas and evident complexity. It boasts a very polished, smooth feel in the mouth that is reinforced by the natural firmness of the noble Nebbiolo grape.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",60044
"77189","Longtime San Francisco Giant Rich Aurilia teams with fellow baseballer Dave Roberts to produce a wine with restrained, focused aromas of black cherry, pencil shavings, sarsaparilla and hints of allspice. The palate is all about black gravel and turned loam, with tiny bits of black cherry and noticeably firm tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",77189
"48915","This wine offers baked flavors of red raspberry, black cherry and grapy plum. It finds its balance between juicy approachability and a swat of tannin that provides depth and body. It finishes ripe and with a suggestion of char.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",48915
"48553","Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green, and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",48553
"46843","This is a sturdy, stemmy, sharp and chewy bottle. It has some bitter, tarry flavors, but might be up to the challenge of spicy foods or stewed meats.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46843
"51160","There's something distinguished about this blend of several varieties, but also something one-dimensional. It's pretty good for the price—dry, smoothly tannic and proper in blackberry, dark chocolate and cassis flavors.","Red","Red Blend","US",51160
"71899","Crisp and fruity, this is a wine full of red currant and blackberry flavors. It does have a tannic structure that will allow the wine to develop along with the acidity. In the family for three-generations, the estate is now run by Denis Hazane. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",71899
"65621","As in the past, Leonetti's 2010 Sangiovese was co-fermented with Syrah (11%), and sourced from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. It's flat-out delicious from the first scents of barrels and fruits, right on through a lush palate rich in flavors of berries, rum-soaked cherries and exotic spices. A long finish, with a smoky/earthy cast, is supported with tart acids.","Red","Sangiovese","US",65621
"86455","Pale in color, delicate in the mouth, this Pinot is marked by dry tannins and a brittle acidity. The fruit is comparatively modest by Santa Rita standards, showing currants, cherries and oranges. Could develop with a few years in the bottle.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86455
"823","Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth. It really needs another year before drinking.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",823
"100131","Minerally power is the main theme to the bouquet on this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend that comes with notes of seashell and even more briary berry and spice aromas. Chewy, round and full in the mouth, this delivers spicy, foresty berry flavors, herbal notes, mushroom hints and peppery spice on a good finish. Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",100131

"92132","This wine comes from the original Merlot blocks at this vineyard, planted in 1982. It's aromatic, with notes of plum, raspberry, clove and generous spices. The flavors coat the palate from end to end, backed by firm tannins that need time to soften out but have the strength to go the distance. It will be best after 2022.","Red","Merlot","US",92132
"9803","Here's a wine that, while expressing the structure of the vintage, brings warmth and a rich blackberry flavor as well. It has a fine texture and a firm, upright feel. Ready for drinking in a year.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",9803
"10290","Dusty and leesy on the nose, this blend of Viura, Malvasia and Garnacha Blanca smells of peach pits and oak. Creamy on the palate, this is a touch flat but not flabby. Banana, melon, vanilla and pecan flavors end with a barrel-heavy mix of vanilla and butter.","White","White Blend","Spain",10290
"32127","Despite possibly being the least complex of Saint Clair's 2010 Pioneer Block Pinots, this medium-bodied wine has crisp acids and mouthwatering flavors of black cherries and fresh herbs. It's fresh, clean and invites sip after sip. Drink now–2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",32127
"47177","This offering comes from a two-acre parcel of Quail Hill Vineyard, the coolest pocket of the site. Earthy, herbal and savory, it's seamless in black cherry, clove and plum. A bite of acidity enlivens the palate before a finish of tannin and oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47177
"23143","Whiffs of savory herb and smoke fade into buoyant fruit on the palate of this juicy, tangerine-kissed Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's easygoing and fruit forward, with a finish marked by sweet apricot and citrus flavors. Drink now through 2020.","White","Riesling","Germany",23143
"71119","Somewhat rugged and astringent now, with a bite of acidity, but it's an enormously rich wine, with blackcurrant and chocolate flavors. Best now with grilled meats. A Bordeaux blend based on Malbec.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",71119
"99821","Powerful, mouthwatering, concentrated black-cherry and blackberry flavors form the core of this full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced wine. Starting with aromas of toasted oak and wood smoke, the wine has a broad rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins that propel the gorgeous fruit flavors across the palate and linger a long time on the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",99821
"85409","Brooding aromas of spice box, herb, purple fruit and wood spice are followed by medium-bodied cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a sense of astringency, requiring some time in the cellar to (hopefully?) soften.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85409
"73472","Here's a wine with great bones: nicely structured with firm tannins and good supportive acidity. It's not light and flabby, but it is very drinkable. Flavors? Think of cola laced with black-cherry juice with a dash of Worcestershire. It's very dry, and the long finish turns spicy.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73472
"91653","This is the weak link in an otherwise increasingly enjoyable range of wines from Barton & Guestier. Positioned somewhere between off dry and medium sweet, it has an edge of bitter sulphur along with almond and quince fruit flavor. The final acidity jars.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",91653
"14389","Friendly, juicy notes of peach on the nose are intensified on the off-dry palate, where the full juiciness of the fruit becomes apparent. The rather warm base is punctuated by hints of zesty, pithy freshness. Drink soon.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",14389
"11549","The mouthfeel of this wine is full and round despite lean flavors of tart tropical fruit and melon rind. The nose offers aromas of fresh herbs and green fruit that reappear on the finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",11549
"99383","Better known for Cabernet, Ballentine brings a deft hand to their Block 9 Zin, which has earned high scores for years. The vineyard is in Calistoga, and the warmth has coaxed out intricate flavors of wild red and black berries and cherries, mocha, herbs and spices, with a distinct black pepper note. The tannins are thick, but very fine. Among the top Napa Zins, this wine will age for a decade or longer.","Red","Zinfandel","US",99383
"94749","This is one of Olivier Leflaive's benchmark wines, showing how his winemaker Franck Grux keeps lightness, freshness and complexity all in play. To start, it is firm and austere, then it bursts out with green fruits, toast, white currants and lemon, integrated and balanced. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",94749
"38037","Melony aromas and a simple mouthfeel render this an enjoyable Torrontés. Melon, apricot and lychee flavors all fit the bill, while the palate is round and viscous. Drink now.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",38037
"88261","Here is another outstanding Sauvignon Blanc from Novelty Hill—ripe and juicy, showing citrus, mango and pear, laced with cinnamon highlights. Winemaker Mike Januik manages to get the most from these young vines, crafting white wines that are both rich and elegant, retain varietal character, and seduce you with hedonistic detail.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",88261
"31258","Coming from a block of vines called South Pointe that are planted closest to the vineyard's creek, this wine shows plum and raspberry fruits on the nose along with smoked licorice and black slate. It's ripe in raspberry flavor at the tip of the sip, but then clings to a restrained line of graphite and peppery, acidic spice, continuing to evolve deep into the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31258
"88556","A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak. There's a purity to the complex waves of blackberries, currants, Canadian bacon, dried herbs, black pepper and sandalwood, with a minerally tang that must come from the soil. Wonderful now, this great Syrah should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.","Red","Syrah","US",88556
"100422","This Chardonnay has dilute peach, citrus and vegetal flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",100422
"22268","Soft and lightly fruity, it has flavors of bitter almonds as well as red fruits. This gives the wine a firm character with some tannins and a mineral texture. Wait until late 2014 before drinking.","Rosé","Rosé","France",22268
"97048","This vino naturale (the wine is not filtered and has no added sulfites) opens with intense aromas of butterscotch, candied fruit, apricot and honey. The blend is Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Malvasia, and it tastes slightly oxidized overall.","White","White Blend","Italy",97048
"37614","Purple flower, perfumed berry, baking spice and dried herb aromas unfold in the glass, along with a hint of espresso. The tight palate shows sour cherry, unripe strawberry, clove, sage and roasted coffee notes alongside close-grained, astringent tannins and racy acidity.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",37614
"16096","Just released after nearly eight years, this wine still tastes lively and timely. It's marked by complex waves of blackberries, mocha, currants, cola and spices, although the fruit is beginning to move into drier, secondary characteristics. It's delicious, and fully ready to drink now. Give it a decanting, and watch as it changes in the glass.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",16096
"92378","As chewy and umami, salty delicious as a mouthful of crunchy bacon. Throw in dried blackberries and blueberries, with a touch of smoky new oak, and that describes this fantastically pure, addictively good Zinfandel. The grape sourcing is from old vineyards in the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys. Truly a great Zin, and relatively easy to find, with 9,000 cases produced.","Red","Zinfandel","US",92378
"71623","A salty, briny, minerally quality is pronounced in this larger-scale wine that opens intensely sour before mellowing into green apple and quince notes. Medium in weight, body and impact, it finishes with a tartness that suggests the need for food.","White","Chardonnay","US",71623
"41484","The bouquet of this wine leads with a note of smoky strawberry, followed by scents of raspberry, anise, toasted baguette and cocoa. It has mouth-clenching tannins that are typical of young, Nebbiolo-based wines, plus penetrating acids and an underlying sense of finesse. Dried herb and rock-like mineral inflections mark the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","US",41484
"85669","This dark red sparkling wine made from Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier smells like Dr. Pepper, has lively bubbles and leaves a dry, very fruity impression on the palate. Dark cherry and ripe plum flavors dominate.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",85669
"51807","This is done in a wide-open, instantly drinkable style that makes it an excellent, everyday quaffer. Young Oregon Pinots often need more time, but not this one. Strawberry, coffee and cola flavors combine into a broad and flavorful midpalate, fresh and inviting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51807
"35538","Made with 85% Carignano and 15% Syrah, this boasts aromas of mature black cherry, raspberry and Mediterranean herb. The soft palate doles out ripe black currant, licorice and black pepper alongside velvety tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",35538
"12360","Tart and slightly bitter, this Lambrusco has all the right qualities to pair with fettuccine in cream sauce. Bright berry flavors are followed by creamy foam and fresh acidity.","Sparkling","Lambrusco","Italy",12360
"5772","Earthy stalky leathery aromas suggest modest ripeness. This feels medium in weight, while short salty flavors of plum and raspberry are herbal and arguably a touch weedy. This feels a little hot on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",5772
"104160","Spicy and fruity, this light, balanced wine has easy, crisp fruit and bright acidity showing citrus and spiciness. It is a refreshing wine, ready to drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",104160
"8342","Cantine Barbera presents a classic but simple expression of Nero d'Avola with an easy nose of cherry, raw fruit and white almond skin. The mouthfeel is bright and compact and shows a touch of sour fruit as well.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",8342
"56091","This structured wine has a great weight of fruit behind its firm tannins. Juicy acidity gives a delicious, fragrant and ripe character. Drink this wine from 2016.","Red","Gamay","France",56091
"58636","This Amarone has ripe blackberry aromas, with hints of raisin and spice. The palate shows black cherry, black pepper and prune notes. It has tight tannins and fresh acidity, but needs time to unwind and develop; drink after 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58636
"19217","This is a soft and fruity wine, ripe with red-berry fruits and perfumed acidity. A light touch of caramel and tannin give the right structure, and the aftertaste is bright and fruity.","Rosé","Rosé","France",19217
"32053","Fleshy and floral, this is a delightfully light, dry and tropical wine, with primary characteristics of apple and lime. Refreshing, it'll serve well as a versatile companion on the table or as as worthy apéritif, finishing in grassy fig and pear.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",32053
"15920","This is a gravel- and mineral-textured wine that has a very structured feel, with red berry flavors and firm tannins. Still young, it is a wine that should soften, so wait until 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",15920
"97335","It is entirely conceivable that this blend of the two Cabernets could improve dramatically with time in the bottle. Currently, it's a very dry, firmly tannic wine, with black currant, mocha, cherry and new oak flavors that have a distinctive edge of sweet herbs, figs and tobacco. Improves considerably with airing in the glass, so decant if you drink it anytime soon.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",97335
"952","Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",952
"81049","The aromas of lychee and rose water pop. The palate brings a slight spritz, with lighter-bodied flavors that linger on the finish. The style is reserved but it shows a good sense of balance.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",81049
"45271","Bing cherry meets soft vanilla and coffee tones on the nose of this southern-Italian transplant. A bouncy palate of red cherry and strawberry is supported by mild tannins.","Red","Nero d'Avola","US",45271
"30920","Here's a focused expression of Barbera (aged only in stainless steel) that opens with bright notes of cherry, cassis, blackberry and a touch of prune. Those fresh fruit flavors are backed by crisp acidity.","Red","Barbera","Italy",30920
"40346","Assertive and delicious, this light-bodied and dry wine has dramatic aromas of wood smoke, wet stones and even diesel. Those are classic for the German grape varieties from which it was made, as are the light peach and white pepper flavors that ride an elegant texture and slightly sweet balance.","White","White Blend","US",40346
"71268","Based on Cercial, here is a rounded, smooth wine with a delicious perfume. Warm, ripe and delicious, this shows wood hints, peaches and green herbs. Keep for a year.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",71268
"105468","Black cherry, vanilla and cedar on the nose of this confident blend are followed by refreshing, spicy flavors of plum, blackberry, cinnamon and cedar. This wine has a kick to it but the fruit's deep softness balances it out. A go-to red with true class.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",105468
"62153","Oak, coconut, espresso and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The taut somewhat lean palate shows raw sour cherry, tart cranberry, espresso and oak-driven spice but not much fruit richness. Tight raspy tannins dry out the finish. Let the tannins soften for a few years then drink to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",62153
"72032","Medium-straw in color, this wine offers aromas of Asian pear, guava and juniper berry. Featuring flavors of Seckel pear, honeysuckle and anise seed, it is bright on entry, goes through a short cool phase, and then brings the brightness back with a finish that includes lingering notes of white peach.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Israel",72032
"60774","Twelve months bottle aging and a selection of Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro have resulted in a powerfully structured wine. The wood aging is still showing in the wine's toasty character with hints of dry extraction spoiling the black fruit flavors. The wine will integrate better as it develops, so wait until 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",60774
"34125","Bright acidity accompanies tight, wild berry fruits. As with many Malbecs, the fruit is balanced against clean earth and stem, with a touch of tomato leaf in the aromas.","Red","Malbec","US",34125
"62941","Aromas of forest floor, espresso, toast, blackberry and dried Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this full-bodied, forward blend of Carignano and 10% Syrah. The round, concentrated palate doles out ripe black cherry, red currant, spiced blueberry, coffee and ground black pepper alongside a firm backbone of velvety tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",62941
"35021","This red-tinted, full-bodied rosé is strained on the nose, with a strong, distinct whiff of wet animal fur. The palate feels heavy and unfocused, while flavors of plum skins and nectarine finish bitter and without any crispness or cleansing properties.","Rosé","Rosé","Argentina",35021
"9722","Very tasty, this medium-bodied version puts forward bright raspberry and ripe red cherry aromas and flavor. Not too big or bold, it's well-balanced with acidity and moderate tannins to bolster the fruit flavors.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",9722
"89838","An absolutely delicious Cabernet, with ripe blackberry, black currant, milk chocolate and spicy oak flavors. Beyond the richness is a superb structure of gorgeously refined tannins and just enough acidity to give balance. So easy to drink, so elegant, you could drain the bottle tonight. But it will age effortlessly through 2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89838
"45468","Aromas of cocoa, blue fruit, herb and spice are followed by dried-out fruit flavors. Medicinal and game notes linger on the finish.","Red","Malbec","US",45468

"63983","A bottling celebrating the winery's 30th anniversary, this offers roasted coffee, nutmeg, star anise, vanilla bean and cinnamon spice atop the pure black-cherry fruit on the nose. There is a tremendous and delicious density of black-currant fruit once sipped, leveled by graphite, espresso foam, cola, cream soda and vanilla-bean flavors, held in place by chewy tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63983
"49800","This wine has a ridiculous alcohol of 16.3%, which makes it prickly, and the dryness makes it taste even hotter, since there's no sugar to balance and soften. It's got extremely ripe blackberry-pie flavors. Be careful if you drink this; a little goes a long way.","Red","Zinfandel","US",49800
"66178","Named after the quail that inhabit the vineyard, this intensely fruity wine is ripe and full-bodied. Flavors of truffles, spice as well as black plums and berries abound. This is a serious wine for aging; keep for at least seven years, although with its great fruit it could be deliciously drinkable sooner.","Red","Malbec","France",66178
"31971","Made from one of the vineyard's historic blocks, this is a lush, inviting and complex wine, defined by golden honey apple and nutmeg. The texture is contoured and structured, with the richness of lemon meringue, but the balance is what stands out most. A tang of white pepper flirts on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",31971
"81959","Surprisingly full bodied, fruit loaded and instantly appealing, this new Chardonnay from Hogue mixes generous flavors of apple and butter, toasted almonds and a little spice.","White","Chardonnay","US",81959
"42465","Lush in winemaker Brian Loring's preferred style, this wine shows roasted cashews, seared lemons and baked apples on the nose. There's a walnut-oil quality to the palate, which is chewy and fat but not overreaching, with touches of tonic, cinnamon and caramel.","White","Chardonnay","US",42465
"81239","This shows off the lovely weight and supple texture of Langhorne Creek fruit alongside bold flavors of chocolate and cassis. Despite that, there's also a nagging bit of green bell pepper that may not be to everyone's taste. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",81239
"38809","Honey, jasmine, salted nectarine, yellow melon and plumeria flowers pop on the nose of this bottling that indicates Roussanne may do well in Temecula. There's solid yellow-grapefruit-pith grip to the palate, a touch of tart tangerine, slate minerality and some botanical elements. It's bright and tense for an often oily, easily over-ripened grape.","White","Roussanne","US",38809
"33280","Based on the Roêda vineyard, this opulent, fruity wine is dense, beautifully ripe, a powerhouse of sweet fruit, figs and raisins, plum jelly and the roundest, most generous tannins. It's a wine that will show well in the next few years, but which should age magnificently.","Port","Port","Portugal",33280
"13972","Powdery berry aromas are sketchy but don't offend. This Garnacha feels jammy, rubbery and on the tannic side, while buttery accents intermingle with briny raspberry flavors. A plump, almost sticky feeling finish shows smacking tannins.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",13972
"79471","The Xavier Flouret brand covers the world, but its Sancerre is always among its most consistent. It is balanced, fruity and only lightly herbaceous. Touches of white currants add to the fruitiness of this ready-to-drink wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",79471
"47602","Rich in character, with big citrus, pineapple and pink grapefruit flavors. Even if it is rich, the wine also gives freshness as well as acidity to balance the full-bodied texture","White","Chardonnay","France",47602
"39719","A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it shows ripe, deep flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, dark chocolate and anise, with smoky overtones from oak. Feels dramatic and impressive. Give it until 2012 to come around.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",39719
"17065","An aromatic, seductive wine, scented with smoke and chocolate, cedar and strawberry. Thick and chewy, with ripe raspberry fruit and a liquorous, barrel-inflected finish. This is a big wine for those who like sheer power, in both fruit and tannins.","Red","Merlot","US",17065
"62648","Vanilla and Animal Cracker aromas fold in mango and banana. The palate is soft and creamy, with not much acidity and pulpy flavors of ripe banana and pithy citrus. Soft and peachy on the finish.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",62648
"85704","This dry wine shows hints of honey as well as pure sliced apple and white stone fruits. It is deliciously crisp, bright with acidity, almonds and a tangy texture. The wine is totally ready to drink in its fruity youth.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",85704
"47416","Fresh lemon-peel and lanolin notes add complexity to this bright, intensely fruity Riesling. Crisp with acidity, it's refreshingly easy on the palate, with a delicate, lacy sugar note that lingers long on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",47416
"62193","Rich and powerful, with a molten intensity, this has loads of blackberry and cherry jam flavors, yet it has a minerally earthiness that grounds it and makes it endlessly complex. With its tannic profile and sweet oak jacket, this defines Napa Valley Cabernet—particularly from the mountains. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–20 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62193
"37845","Tight and herbaceous, this nervy, crisp wine is full of lemon and lime juice cut with an orange zest. Floral and full of acidity, it leaves a mineral, steely aftertaste.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",37845
"77171","This is easily one of the most delicious Cabernets of the year. The first sip dazzles, offering a treasure chest of flavors, including blackberry, spice, mocha and toasted oak. For all the richness, the wine is properly dry, and the tannins are as smooth as old silk. It's so approachable, it's hard to believe it's from Diamond Mountain, whose tannins are notoriously hard in youth. The one drawback is that the wine is too soft for aging, but who cares? Drink now–2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77171
"73788","Blackberry and black cherry sauce aromas are given intrigue with tobacco leaf and sharp clove spice on this wine from a vineyard between the Santa Lucia Highlands and the Carmel Valley. Cinnamon stick and allspice shine on the very spicy palate, which is laid across a boysenberry backbone, with flecks of black pepper throughout.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73788
"99568","Maple-syrup aromas and a practically syrupy texture make this full-bodied wine taste sweet, while baking spices like cinnamon and vanilla accent the deep, ripe blackberry and black-cherry flavors. It's a very tasty wine for oak lovers.","Red","Zinfandel","US",99568
"56852","Lime and passion fruit aromas are subtle and appealing. This delivers a fresh, alert palate and crisp, lightly brined flavors of lettuce, apple and cucumber. On the finish, it runs peppery but not overly aggressive.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",56852
"4340","Aromas of blackberry, black currant, cinnamon and dark plum lead to high toned herbal, green olive, licorice and barrel spice grace notes. The black fruit flavors are forward and concentrated, with smoked meat on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",4340
"68706","Mild raspberry and tomato aromas precede a grabby-feeling wine with sandpaper tannins and flavors of medicinal plum and tomato. It comes across loud but raw and unrefined.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",68706
"56060","While this wine does not age in wood, it does age on its lees, giving it a rich, creamy texture. It's smooth, full and soft, its apricot and peach flavors showing ripeness and openness. Drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",56060
"2547","The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine. For aging at least six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",2547
"16396","This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",16396
"89413","One of a range of single-vineyard wines from Château de Fuissé, this is powerful and complex. It's intense, with white fruit flavors that are laced with concentrated, wood-influenced notes. It has an opulent, generous feel, while remaining structured.","White","Chardonnay","France",89413
"4358","A wish of smoke adds complexity and mystery to bright tangerine, white peach and floral notes on this dry-style Riesling. It's delicate in body, but vibrantly structured, with tart lemon-lime acidity that pierces through ripe stone-fruit flavors on the palate.","White","Riesling","US",4358
"76395","While the nose seems a bit savory, with muted apple and honeycomb notes, this dry, full-bodied Riesling is quite fruity on the palate, with pleasant peach and nectarine flavors. It's brisk, with lemon-lime acidity and just a hint of astringency on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",76395
"56140","The palate on this Tempranillo has smacking acids that create crisp flavors of raspberry and red plum, and there's a pinch of oaky vanilla for counterbalance. Overall this is juicy, fresh and simple.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",56140
"104423","A bit unrefined, with candied pear, apricot jam and oak flavors and a soft texture. Feels heavy, instead of lively.","White","Chardonnay","US",104423
"88259","This Amarone is made in a traditional style with aromas of forest berry, red apple, spice and barbecue smoke. It exhibits pretty luminosity and buoyancy with vibrant fruit flavors and a fresh cherry finale. Very nice.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",88259
"89802","This yellow-gold wine is packed with bright floral and citrus scents and flavors. It's a mouthful of lemon-drop goodness, with the rough edges smoothed by a percentage aged in neutral oak. The finish features light honey, with a slight burn.","White","Viognier","US",89802
"46324","Ripasso is a perfect wine for a chilly autumn evening with roasted meat and a roaring fireplace. Hearty and determined, this shows soft black fruit, with barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",46324
"44484","Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way. Drink 2018–2030.","White","Riesling","Austria",44484
"4404","With full black-cherry and bacon aromas, this affordable wine comes across well on the nose. Thick and full-bodied in the mouth, this has flavors of blackberry, creamy oak, chocolate and vanilla. It feels broad and just bright enough on the finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",4404
"52479","Dark cranberry and cola scents mesh with sage and roasted fennel on the nose of this bottling, an ode to Bill Foley's Texas rancher ancestors. Cranberry and black cherry greet the palate while roasting spices of marjoram and thyme add complexity, before bright tannins and brisk tartness carry into the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",52479
"13797","What an interesting wine. It drinks like it really comes from someplace, which is to say, it has terroir. It smells earthy and peppery, with a perfume of cassis. It's soft in tannins and acids, but utterly delicious. Hard to exaggerate the lip-smacking quality and fantastic finish.","Red","Syrah","US",13797
"65500","Thin and green flavors dominate this Cabernet Franc. Small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot do not seem to have made an impact. It's sharp, stiff, and quite herbal.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",65500
"73568","A nose based on candied fruit is pretty much the script for all of the Macaw reds. Like the others, this Merlot is sticky but also acidic. Flavors of raspberry Kool-Aid and foxy plum are mercifully short on the finish.","Red","Merlot","Brazil",73568
"86974","Plum and cherry notes struggle to show themselves under a heavy layer of coconut and sawdust from new American oak. This wine is tightly wound and dense in the mouth, with refreshing acidity and a medium-to-long finish. A year or two in the cellar will allow for better integration.","Red","Red Blend","US",86974
"49846","Figs and spice perfume this tawny Cabernet Franc ice wine. It's a bit rustic in style, evoking layers of fallen leaves and potpourri melding with dusty raisins and figs. But it's elegantly crisp and the exotic, uniquely spicy character is seductive.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",49846
"46644","Abnormally high pyrazines give this a sharp, oily nose. This feels and tastes much like it smells; the mouth is sharp and angular, while sour grapefruit flavors and oily bitterness on the finish suggest green Sauvignon Blanc.","White","Albariño","Spain",46644
"68123","Made entirely fromSangiovese, this opens with red berry, underbrush and exotic spice aromas. The palate is straightforward and evocative of black cherries, crushed mint and a tobacco, framed by polished tannins. Drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",68123
"54771","Light straw in the glass, this wine offers green herbal aromas on the nose, complemented by floral notes and a whiff of sandalwood. Its green apple flavors and strong minerality make for an enjoyable quaff.","White","Pinot Grigio","Slovenia",54771
"6304","From a dark bottle, this salmon-colored rosé is medium-bodied and made in a bigger style than many others. Fully textured, it discloses flavorful touches of crunchy pear and cranberry. It would go well with a goat cheese salad adorned in dried cranberries and cherries.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6304
"52459","A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain. It shows the big, firm tannins of its origins, with a dry sturdiness backing up the intense black currant flavors. Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52459
"51095","Viognier and Vermentino spend some time in both stainless steel and oak, which gives this blend fresh aromas and a creamy palate. Stone fruit, apricot, honey and white flower notes are accompanied by mildly spicy overtones.","White","White Blend","Italy",51095
"53284","This has dill, minestrone soup, toast and chopped celery aromas. The lean, assertive palate shows oak, raw red fruit and a green note of powdered sage. Grainy tannins leave an astringent finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",53284
"23729","Whole clusters of Syrah are co-fermented with Viognier to create this tight, concisely crafted wine. This is a firm expression of field and grape, with bright berry fruit and chocolaty tannins. The slightly chalky finish may smooth out with a bit more bottle age.","Red","Syrah","US",23729
"25162","This wine, from a label named after one of the state's wine pioneers, is Chardonnay in the traditional California style—done exceedingly well. Aromas of caramelized apples and butterscotch lead into a palate full of apple flesh, vanilla custard and sea salt, yet with enough pithy acidity to keep the mouth watering.","White","Chardonnay","US",25162
"73567","Kerosene aromas and a perfumed character come from the Malvasia in the blend. It is a perfumed wine with touches of green fruits and acidity. The wine doesn't quite hang together.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",73567
"1201","Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018–2024.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",1201
"94619","This is a creamy wine with soft fruitiness. The roundness is happily cut with acidity and with a citrus edge that lifts the melon and pear flavors. The aftertaste is tangy and zesty. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",94619
"69726","A rich effort, this offers ripe pear, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Interesting notes of mushrooms and dried fruits are beginning to emerge, although that might indicate the wine's limited ageability. Drink over the next 1–2 years.","White","Chardonnay","US",69726
"92813","Winemaker Bill Owen consistently produces one of Washington's most stylish Rieslings. High in acid and low in alcohol, the sweet-tart balance of the wine is exciting and perfectly rendered. Despite a change in vineyard sources, this remains rich, round and juicy, with flavors of peach, apricot and a hint of fresh cream.","White","Riesling","US",92813
"3080","Minerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense. The palate offers good acidity and razor-sharp clarity, along with flavors of pineapple and apple. Alert on the finish, this is a firm refresher.","White","Albariño","Spain",3080
"47186","This intense Mencía is showing heavy doses of asphalt, raw oak, char, exotic wood and dark berry aromas. It's layered, rich and lively in the mouth, with heady, toasty flavors of smoked black fruits. A mix of toast, baking spices and licorice flavors shadow subtle but integral black-fruit notes. Best from 2015 through 2020.","Red","Mencía","Spain",47186
"79424","With its light prickle on the tongue and mineral texture, this is a crisp, dry wine. It is floral with pineapple and bright apple flavors. The acidity and the tangy orange zest all add to the freshness of the wine. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",79424
"106490","Good grip is immediately apparent, along with a burst of tangy citrus and cherry fruit. Sour plum comes up as well, and it's clearly the fruit, not the barrels, that are in the center ring. A high-acid finish keeps it fresh and lively.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",106490
"31814","Aromas of blackberry jam and boysenberry lead to a ripe full-bodied palate. It brings a sense of hedonism.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",31814
"24949","This opens with aromas of red rose, wild berry, scorched earth, leather and a whiff of toast. On the palate, notes of coconut and grilled herb accent a core of raw red berry while tightly packed tannins offer support.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",24949
"23344","Wayward and slightly weedy on the nose, with candied fruit notes that help it along. The palate is more acidic and rhubarby than ideal, although the tartness is offset by a creamy flavor of carob bean. Short and hot on the finish; acceptable but not well executed.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",23344
"40512","Clean, bright and focused, this is currently showing its youth, though with great promise to continue to mature and flesh out with another couple of years. Notes of yellow apple, beeswax, straw and honeysuckle abound on the nose, while flavors of orange oil and honeycomb flesh out the medium-weight palate, with great verve and lingering spicy elements through the close. It's approachable now, but should drink best from 2018–2021.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",40512
"18201","From a vineyard above Santa Paula, this bottling shows black plum, underripe berry and cedar touches on the nose. Tart black fruit marks the palate, lifted by dried lilac elements and lava rock minerality, all held together by upright tannins. Persistent acidity leaves the mouth zinging.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",18201
"62115","A blend of lots left over from Calera's three prime vineyards, it's an intriguing combination of delicacy and power. The color is pale, the aroma is cola-like and it's light on the palate. But the depth of fruit is great, and so is the complexity. This wine will age well.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",62115
"17757","In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit––especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",17757
"35589","Peach and grapefruit pith, earth and lemon mix on nose and palate to create a deep-fruited wine with midpalate concentration. The body is fresh and rich and just dry, bordered and contained by that enticing grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",35589
"97483","Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",97483
"53610","Smooth, soft creamed fruits and fresh acidity combine easily here in this purely fruity wine. Lightly aromatic, it's a buoyant wine that's ready to drink now. Screwcap.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",53610
"102153","Underbrush, grilled porcini, roasted herb and menthol emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied, structured palate is initially closed but eventually reveals dark berry, white pepper, sage and orange zest alongside clenched tannins. It closes on a licorice note.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",102153
"100375","Aromas of oak, espresso, earth and leather characterize this blend of 95% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate shows toasted oak, black pepper and black cherry notes but the fruit is starting to fade. Drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",100375
"904","Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",904
"65482","This ripe, juicy wine has flavors of spice and black cherry, along with soft tannins. Fruity and ready to drink, it has a bright line of acidity.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",65482
"85366","This is a bold, jazzy, full-bodied wine with little oak influence. It oozes ripe fruit flavor onto a surprisingly solid structure of fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. Grapy, jammy aromas lead to generous, mouthcoating blackberry flavors, nice grip on the palate and a lingering finish.","Red","Dolcetto","US",85366
"90626","This demonstrates, as well as any other example, that exceptional wines were made in the often-maligned 2011 vintage. Cranberry, raspberry, cola and allspice elements are woven gracefully in a lovely wine that closes with just a faint, beguiling whiff of smoke.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90626
"78972","Ripe berry aromas intermingle with toast and maple notes on the nose of this saturated, tannic blend of Granacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Flavors of black plum, tomato, spice and herbs hint at Priorat's famous schisty soils, while this expands on an aggressive finish. Drink through 2023.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",78972
"31438","This wine has deeply concentrated yet focused and spicy purple-fruit tones. It's generously endowed with notes of tobacco, licorice, mineral and pepper. The highlights keep piling on through a finish that seems to run for several minutes. This bold wine is enjoyable now but should also cellar well through 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",31438
"45817","Gifford Hirlinger's Stateline Red is perhaps the least-known best-value wine in the Walla Walla AVA. The blend changes radically from year to year—this is 83% Cabernet with splashes of Malbec, Tinta Cão, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot. Focused and concentrated, it has a streak of orange and cherry liqueur, and yummy highlights of coffee cake.","Red","Red Blend","US",45817
"94869","A bit of apple, a bit of citrus, a bit of toast—things are just hinted at in this frothy sparkler which would make an ideal, dry-finishing but lively party wine.","White","Riesling","Austria",94869
"63669","Already mature, this medium-bodied wine offers scents of dried fruit and leather, then flavors of caramelized, roasted black cherries and more leather. It's a bit coarsely textured, then falls away on the finish. Drink soon.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",63669
"96552","Perfumed, rich yet soft, this is opulent Beaune at its best. It has acidity and a touch of tannin, but it's the broad, ripe red-fruit flavors that dominate, which gives juiciness and vitality to this wine that will age for several years.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",96552
"84381","The alluring lightness of scent here conjures up citrus-flavored snowflakes—symmetrical and delicate little crystals of lemony deliciousness that melt on the tongue one by one, releasing a constant stimulus of utterly joyous freshness—whichever cloud they fell from. It simply bursts with lemon and grapefruit zest, and even with lime. Slender, incisive purity echoes long in a blizzard of bracing and lasting thrill.","White","Riesling","Austria",84381
"68009","Fresh lemon and red-apple flavors are bright and clean in this medium-bodied dry white. While brisk in texture and approachably fresh, the finish is marked by a bite of astringency.","White","Chardonnay","US",68009
"88058","While the nose is focused on delicate lemon, apple and talc aromas, the juicy palate brings peach and crunchy red apple-skin flavors. Off dry in style, with vibrant acidity, this is a well-balanced offering from this northern Michigan producer.","White","Riesling","US",88058
"6026","Robust black-fruit aromas suggest plum and blackberry. This everyday red is concentrated, generous and packed with power. Flavors of dark berry fruits, chocolate and espresso finish with verve and clarity.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",6026
"16383","Le Sughere is a well-composed wine, except for a hint of Band-Aid that blows off relatively quickly to enhance natural aromas of red fruit, root beer and toast. It offers sweet herb flavors and fresh mint on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",16383
"80131","Overt floral and lychee aromas, lean peach and bosc pear flavors and a smooth, dry texture make an exotic mix for this medium-bodied wine.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",80131
"66940","This wine shows the hand of the winemaker in the buttered toast, vanilla, crème brulée, honey and creamy lees that dominate the palate. The underlying fruit is a little thin, suggesting tangerines and papayas. The price-quality ratio is fair.","White","Chardonnay","US",66940
"90414","Brisk and refreshing in the mouth, with stimulating acidity. But it's a little too sweet in the combination of jammy citrus fruit and smoky oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",90414
"65553","Surprisingly, in the blind lineup, Ingleside's regular bottling of Merlot fared slightly better than its Reserve bottling of the same vintage. Overall, this is a supple wine, with flavors of chocolate-covered cherry and clove as well as a note of pear drop that cuts through the core.","Red","Merlot","US",65553
"48597","A complex, full-bodied wine that is full of mature fruit flavors with a touch of toast to add to the attractive mix. With apple, quince and almonds well blended together, this is a finely balanced wine, that could age for a couple of years more.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",48597
"67372","High-toned strawberry and cherry open this medium-bodied wine that takes on heavier, darker overtones of dried herb, nutmeg and black tea as it goes. From a meticulously farmed vineyard also known for Chardonnay, it conveys a stamp of tobacco on the oak that invites thoughts of leather chairs and cigars.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67372
"2548","Lots of toasty oak on this Pinot, but also plenty of rich, unctuous fruit to support it. Shows ample flavors of cloves, cinnamon, ripe wild cherries, and earthy, forest floor notes of balsam and dried pine needles. The texture is lightly delicate and silky, with crisp acidity. Really shows off the Clos Pepe terroir in a delightful way.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2548
"54437","Camphor, menthol, toast and espresso aromas lead the nose. The firm, tightly wound palate shows roasted coffee bean, dried cherry and licorice alongside bracing tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",54437
"99654","Zesty lemon paired with riper tropical notes of pineapple counter the racy acidity of this full-flavored wine. This takes time to open up but the intense palate is worth the wait. So serious it should be had with food.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",99654
"81916","This is Esterlina's off-dry Riesling, and it's as good in its semi-sweet way as a dry bottling. Shows the same brilliant acidity and delicious citrus, peach, wildflower and vanilla flavors, with a complex, honeyed richness.","White","Riesling","US",81916
"103558","Match stick and oily white-fruit aromas come in front of a round, somewhat fat palate with warm, oily flavors of lychee, banana and spice. This falls off toward ripe banana and blandness on the finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","Chile",103558
"85180","Overripe flavors of raisins and prunes compromise this Zinfandel. It's dry and pretty tannic, and the alcohol is high, giving it a hot, porty finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",85180
"67754","The Soberanes Vineyard is the source to well-regarded wines from Bruliam, Siduri and Bernardus. Lucia's 2011 is a good followup to their 2010, showing fresh, jammy cherry and persimmon flavors, brightened with zippy acidity and finished with sweet oak. Will benefit from a few years in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67754
"37751","Soft aromas of grapefruit, sage and lavender lead to flavors of green apple, eucalyptus, and aniseed. This wine has a pleasant balance of fresh fruit and cool herbal notes. It is smooth on the palate with a cooling lemon-rind finish.","White","Chenin Blanc","Israel",37751
"106671","The blend is 44% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Malbec. The result is a medium- to full-bodied wine with firm structure that should drink well through 2020. Leather, earth and plum notes pick up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","New Zealand",106671
"33297","A blast of passion fruit is accompanied by mango and lettuce scents on a lean nose. This wine is citric and lemony in the mouth, with tangerine and lemon-lime flavors boosted by scouring acidity. The wine is one-dimensionally lean and tangy throughout.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",33297
"10842","Substantial in dense red plum and black cherry, this dry, chewy wine will benefit from a decant or time in the glass. It furnishes a high-toned kick of acidity on the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",10842
"99731","There's a very intriguing sachet-like aroma to this bottling, reminiscent of a potpourri bag left in a cigar box alongside pipe tobacco and sweet cherry syrup. Sour cranberry fruit leads the sip, where the herbal character is impressively pervasive, though perhaps a tad too much so.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",99731
"94010","A strong marking of cedar, pencil and green tobacco exude aromatically and emphatically before soft, silky waves of integrated oak and tannin play on the palate. Elegant, this wine finishes in a hurry.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",94010
"95940","This lesser-known vineyard is the source of at least two stupendous eisweins in 2009. This one features demerara syrup and ripe peaches imbued with an incredibly lush texture, yet balanced by bright acids and a slightly briny quality on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",95940
"68102","A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",68102
"78819","This is a dark bomber with black cherry, kirsch, lemony oak and shoe polish aromas. The palate is creamy and big, with acid-derived lift boosting blackberry and licorice flavors. With tons of black-fruit character, this qualifies as a fruit-forward wine with sweet overtones.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",78819
"59706","The ripe cherry fruit carries highlights of orange peel, herbes de Provence and Orange Pekoe tea. At first tannic and drying, the wine opens into a more giving, tongue-coating style. Slight bitterness may be a function of its youth, as the overall balance and complexity suggests it will improve with some additional bottle age. Drink 2018–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59706
"82429","Ouch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",82429
"96502","Mature smelling, with citrus peel, tobacco and molasses on the nose. The palate is a bit lean and acidic 10 years after harvest, with little expansiveness and driving, citrusy flavors of raspberry and red plum. Juicy but clampy on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",96502
"59932","Quite dark in the glass, this bottling has a nose that suggests boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. The dense aromas are livened up by iron, black loam, Indian spice and black-tea notes. The same range of dark fruits power the palate, especially black plums, and the rich and tangy flavors are nuanced with black sage, bergamot and eucalyptus notes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",59932
"13879","Polished and varietal, this shows the skills of winemaker Chuck Reininger. The 2006 vintage produced tight, hard-edged, herbal wines, ageworthy but unyielding. But here it has been honed and softened, so that its Bordeaux-like traits are emphasized, with plenty of herbal character and spicy purple fruits. Still coming out of its shell, this is a wine to cellar and drink with a big, grilled steak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",13879
"1904","One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it. Ripe as can be on the palate, with equal parts mulled black fruit, spice and mocha. It finishes smooth, with generous extract but nothing grating or grabby. Drink now through 2012.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",1904
"9779","Like the La Louvée, this wine is plummy and superripe, wrapped in toasty, cedary oak. It's savory as well, with meaty notes carried along by waves of richness. The finish is lined with mouthcoating tannins, suggesting a few years of cellaring are warranted. Drink 2018–2030.","Red","Syrah","France",9779
"24288","Jammy plum and raspberry aromas are meaty and hint at being plush. A flush, fairly full mouthfeel packs power, while flavors of plum and prune fade toward herbal, with residual weight to the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",24288
"97562","This modern interpretation of Dolcetto opens with plush, meaty tones of black cherry and blueberry backed by power and concentration. The finish is short, clean and tight.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",97562
"97066","Softness of tannins makes this wine feel melted in the mouth, yet it has bright, zingy acidity, and the raspberry and cherry fruit is sweet and jammy. The result is simple.","Red","Merlot","US",97066
"73822","An oily character of tangerine skin, peach flesh and condensed nuts meets with caramel, pinched soda and cut stone-fruit freshness on the nose of this top bottling from the Los Gatos producer. The palate shows ripe Granny Smith apple flesh, seared pears and almond oil, with a sea-salt splash on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",73822
"40297","Peach and apple aromas are light. Peachy acidity carries the palate toward basic flavors of orange and nectarine, while the finish feels healthy but low on flavor and character.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",40297
"9638","Floral and fruity, with clean aromas. In the mouth, it's saturated and intense as if offers up a meaty set of dense fruit flavors. Doesn't show as much complexity, layering and variety as we might like to see, but it's pretty flashy and good for a 2007, a vintage that was problematic in this region.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",9638
"103340","Initially closed, this opens up slowly into a very bundled, concentrated yet fluid stream of citrus flesh and zest. There are overtones of kitchen herbs like chervil but lemony freshness trumps. There is a lightness of touch, a wonderful, lithe elegance and a lasting finish.","White","Riesling","Austria",103340
"36759","This wine is volatile and grassy on the nose, and extremely horsey. Odd flavors of mango and pineapple are way out of place, and the finish tastes of bad tobacco.","Red","Malbec","Chile",36759
"28270","A murky wine with tree bark, rooty fruit aromas and a sharp, high-acid palate that's tannic. Tastes herbal, tart and a bit vegetal, with an herbal, scratchy finish that strongly hints at green. Imported by GOS Wines and BMC Imports.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Chile",28270
"62521","This densely concentrated wine is intense with blackberry and black currant flavors. The tannins are strong but very finely textured, giving the wine a velvety mouthfeel. It finishes with sweet oak notes and a warmth from alcohol that barbecue will easily handle.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62521
"22892","While intensely ripe on the nose, with scents of white peach, tangerine and quince, this is a dry, remarkably savory wine. It's dense and bold in body, but brightened by fresh herbal tones and a zesty lemon-pith finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",22892
"87846","Graphite, wood grain, spice and black-fruit aromas are full and a touch funky. Tight, crisp and direct on the palate, this Syrah sports a good mouthfeel and toasty, herbal flavors of blackberry and mixed hard spices. Baked berry fruit flavors and chewy tannins are wrapped in an oaky finish. Drink through 2018.","Red","Syrah","Chile",87846
"18125","With an edge of sweet red currants and slightly sugared herb tea, this Zin can't really be called completely dry. But the tannin-acid balance is very fine, and makes the wine balanced and enjoyable. Should be great with pasta with a marinara sauce.","Red","Zinfandel","US",18125
"79314","Restrained aromatically, with a slight minerally-graphite note, this is a pleasantly stony wine, perhaps a bit austere. It's medium bodied, ending with a touch of grapefruit pith.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",79314
"68345","Wines from Plan de Dieu are rarely seen in the U.S., but this is an attractive offering from the Quiot family's holdings in that region. It's dark in profile, with aromas and flavors that veer from black cherry toward black olive and coffee. It's medium bodied, with some fine, slightly dusty tannins on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",68345
"43437","This is a shade off-dry, with ample crispness, a bright, prickly lightness and delicate texture. It's a great apéritif style, with its soft edge and easygoing freshness, that's ready to drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",43437
"74577","Rusty in color, this wine features aromas of compost, juniper and a touch of floral red fruit. It comes on strong in the mouth, with a leafy, rustic dried-cherry flavor, before feeling hard and tannic.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",74577
"105915","This is intensely rich, with very concentrated ripe fruit. Apple and peach flavors are cut by acidity. A note of pepper details the finish. Age for 3–4 years.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",105915
"34376","Old-vine Oregon Zinfandel is not common; in fact, this is all of them. From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”","Red","Zinfandel","US",34376
"50780","A delicate, lacy style of Pinot Noir, with pretty rhubarb-like herbal shadings to the cranberry and strawberry fruit, extremely supple tannins and hints of cocoa and coffee on the abbreviated finish. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",50780
"16602","The name means Tank 26. This is a wine offering fresh fruit, a creamy undertow and crispness. The acidity is prominent, with excellent fresh pepper and lime crispness.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",16602
"70503","Sometimes a wine’s bouquet says it all: Here it’s delectable, redolent of black cherries and prunes. It also looks great in the glass. Flavors are of raspberry and light oak. The mouthfeel is beautiful. While all Panther Creek wines have a sleekness to them, the Nysa sets the standard for being sleek. 170 cases made.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70503
"41949","While this wine has hints of a green herbal character, its main character conveys creamed apples and even riper fruits such as white peach. It is soft and lightly textured with just a touch of final acidity. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",41949
"49378","For an entry-level wine, Rosso dei Notri is a sophisticated and compelling red. A blend of Sangiovese (60%), Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet, it boasts dense extraction and a chewy, chunky mouthfeel. Aromas include bursting blueberry, talc powder and smoked bacon. Bright acidity appears on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",49378
"27880","This wine is full of juicy fruit along with a dark, smoky character. A firm undertow of very dry tannins brings out a firm structure. The hard edge needs to soften, so wait to drink until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",27880
"94023","Aromas of vanilla, coconut and clove mix with dark fruit and black pepper on this fruit-and-barrel-style wine. It's full bodied and high octane, needing more fruit intensity to balance it out.","Red","Syrah","US",94023
"13195","Simple and sharp in acidity, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors commingling in an uncomfortable coating of sweet oak. This Rhône-style blend from Beckmen is a disappointment.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",13195
"68232","A smoky, peppery aroma and equally spicy flavor set this medium-bodied wine apart from the pack. Dry in style, it has a firm, tannic texture. Bring out the lamb or beef to enjoy with this one.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",68232
"51580","Lots of ripe Zinny character in this wine, which is a blend of vineyards from throughout the valley. It's enormously rich in raspberry and cherry jam fruit, spiced with cinnamon, cloves and anise, and finished with sweet, smoky sandalwood.","Red","Zinfandel","US",51580
"62264","A complex, dark-cherry-flavored Petite Sirah, this is marked by bright fruit and tame tannins, giving the wine a mouthwatering vibrancy. Intense but full of life, bottle aging has helped this wine, as it often does with a variety like Petite Sirah, which can be overwhelming when young. In this case, the years have opened it up, lending an elegance that makes the wine ideal for meaty foods.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",62264
"36357","The wine is soft, rich, and full of generous yellow fruits that are layered with wood. It is spicy and ripe, with acidity to match the generous opulent fruits. Delicious, rich and full bodied, the wine is ready to drink.","White","Viognier","Portugal",36357
"59752","This is a low-production wine sourced from a single block in the winery's estate vineyard. It has a modest oak influence and brisk acidity. The wine is easy to like with tart papaya, lime, peach and vanilla flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",59752
"38886","This delicious wine from old Sémillon vines offers a hint of nuts and spice as well as crisp, clean fruit. It is lively with acidity as well as having a richer side. The wine will be just right from the end of 2017.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",38886
"70051","Intense honeysuckle perfume is offset by enticing complexities of mushroom and earth in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. Concentrated tangerine and stone fruit flavors extend through a long, sunny finish. It's showing well already but should continue to improve through 2020.","White","Riesling","Germany",70051
"95491","Oak is front and center on this high-priced affair from Freixenet. And that's the primary problem with what is otherwise a commendable and solid wine. Vanilla and resin aromas and flavors push the fruit to the side, and what's left is a slick of butter, sawdust and tannic astringency. Not a bust, but for nearly a hundred bucks we want more than just wood. Imported by Freixenet USA.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",95491
"15122","Dramatic in aromas and opulent in flavors, this rich and gorgeously fruity wine has a great sense of layering and concentration, and a moderately tannic texture that feels layered and supple on the palate. Light spicy nuances dress up the focused black cherry and blueberry flavors.","Red","Dolcetto","US",15122
"35519","This is a bigger, more forceful wine than its Lindemans stablemate, but not quite as charming. The flavors are earthy and dark, featuring hints of cola and root beer. Finishes with drying tannins. —J.C.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",35519
"16365","Well balanced wine, the entry level of the Conceito range. It has lively acidity and red cherry and strawberry fruits packed with underlying tannins. It is a fresh wine, showing the lighter side of the Douro, while retaining great minerality.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",16365
"80032","Light aromas of white flowers and freshly cut pear lead to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit wanting.","White","Riesling","US",80032
"17829","De Bortoli almost always seems to emphasize the savory side of wine, and this Heathcote Shiraz stays true to that philosophy. Black olive and espresso notes speak of Shiraz, while the the structure remains tight and firm on the finish. This should age well through at least 2020.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",17829
"60728","Very fresh and crisp initially, this wine then develops a richer, denser character. Lime and lemon acidity cuts through the rich pear and white plum fruits, giving texture and structure. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",60728
"9490","A very streamlined Chardonnay, this bottling from a vineyard southwest of the Sta. Rita Hills shows aromas of chalk, Meyer lemon slices, white flowers and apple pie crusted with almond and coconut flakes. Persistent acidity carries the palate into flavors of gravel, lemongrass, lime and lemon-lime.","White","Chardonnay","US",9490
"92142","Hot in alcohol, simple in everything else, this Grenache has thin, overripe pruny flavors.","Red","Grenache","US",92142
"96551","Lush and decadent, this wine has blackberry and blueberry jam, milk chocolate and toasty oak flavors. And even with all of the richness, the finish is dry and tannic. The gripping tannins suggest it can age for for 5–6 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96551
"19949","Beronia has blended modern and traditional touches to create a fine gran reserva with spice, vanilla, coconut, tobacco and dried berry aromas. The palate offers ripe tannins and kick, while the flavor profile is earthy, with mocha, coffee, chocolate and dried berry flavors. A long, lightly toasted and chocolaty finish provides a fitting end to an excellent wine. Best from 2015–2022.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",19949
"87422","This serviceable red blend includes smaller amounts of Merlot and Syrah, with tart red fruits and drying tannins. It dries out the mouth with a chalky sensation, suggesting it would be best enjoyed with red meat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87422
"100120","Classic Cabernet aromas of cassis and boysenberry are steady on the nose. This is plush and mouthfilling, with good overall balance. Flavors of herbs, olive, chocolate, baking spices and blackberry are bright, healthy and end with notes of additional spices and herbs.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",100120
"22104","Tightly wound and sharply focused, this bottling mixes white-fleshed fruit and lime zest scents with herb and mineral touches of chive, clay and wet slate. Its acidity stays zippy into its second day open, while sesame, sake and more mineral flavors emerge. Drink now–2024.","White","Chardonnay","US",22104
"7330","There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish.","Red","Gamay","France",7330
"40927","Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",40927
"71175","Less tangy than some Loire Sauvignon Blanc, this easy, soft wine has attractive acidity and a balanced, steely texture. It's crisp, with some herbaceousness over grapefruit flavors. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",71175
"4017","Veteran producer Oak Knoll remains one of Oregon's most underrated value wineries. This full-bodied, super-fruity Riesling offers bright, off-dry, well-balanced flavors of citrus, honey and tea.","White","Riesling","US",4017
"104473","Light, spicy aromas like vanilla and nutmeg and ripe, full blackberry and cherry flavors come with a soft texture and almost sweet balance. This has lots of flavor with medium body and without drying tannins and acidity. The winemaker blended in 10% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",104473
"96157","Smoke, char and dark fruit aromas are followed by full-bodied blackberry flavors. The tannins bring some grittiness that holds it back.","Red","Syrah","US",96157
"67753","This has the look and feel of a fine white Burgundy, with expressive acidity, pinpointed oak, rich creaminess and a certain stony minerality. Yet the fruit is pure California, tropical and succulent. The wine is from the Pisoni family.","White","Chardonnay","US",67753
"78793","This straightforward, simple wine brings together sensations of violet, red cherry and light baking spices. The warm, forward palate finishes on a sweet note of cherry extract. It's made to be enjoyed young and will pair well with hearty pasta dishes.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",78793
"30267","This is a very big, rich, dense Pinot Noir, and some will fault it for having the high alcohol and full body that are characteristic of Cabernet. Nonetheless, this is immensely complex and dramatic, offering wave after wave of concentrated black cherry and red currant, with notes of bacon and sweet oak. Gets better and more attractive as it warms in the glass. Drink now–2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",30267
"57666","A pale pink sparkler with loads of intensity and elegance, Essence opens with delicate aromas of cranberry, toasted almond, mature fruit and grapefruit. The wine's perlage is steady and foamy.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",57666
"41013","Tastes overly sweet, almost like a dessert wine, the result of residual sugar. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries and chocolate are wrapped in a soft texture.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",41013
"72575","With bright fruitiness, this is an attractive black-currant flavored wine. It has fine acidity that cuts through the wine's gentle, tannic character and leaves a lively, fresh aftertaste.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",72575
"83551","A softly gentle, ultrarich Chardonnay. Fruity flavors of pineapples and Key lime pie are enriched with notes of caramelized vanilla, buttered toast, sautéed banana and honey. A stony minerality offers much needed weight and balance. Delicious. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",83551
"11111","Winemaker Flint Nelson co-ferments this unusual Mourvèdre with Syrah and Grenache, yielding a wine with unusually smooth integration of flavors. Multifaceted and supple, this has layers of ripe fruit, spice, lead pencil, cedar and clean earth flavors, which continue smoothly onto the medium-long finish.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",11111
"68541","This powerful Cabernet Sauvignon calls on 13% Malbec to further its brawn, the mix spending two years in entirely new French oak. Hugely muscular, it needs time to calm its masterfully ripe fruit and dark layers of clove spice, and to further soften its tannins and coax out the shy component of herb. The vineyard behind the wine is Bismark within the newly named Moon Mountain District.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",68541
"102467","Lemon curd, white peach and tangerine aromas make for a nicely rounded nose in this appellation blend. It's a very familiar Chardonnay expression on the palate, with a citrus edge that cuts through ripe pear and sea salt flavors. The mouthfeel shows chalky tension.","White","Chardonnay","US",102467
"17911","Spritzy, citrus-focused refreshment sets the tone on nose and palate. This is slender and light-bodied, but totally fresh-flavored with a lemony zing on the finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",17911
"18141","This opens with a strong scent of herb and bud; it's sharp and aggressively leafy. The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18141
"29012","This wine is fruity, with attractive supporting tannins and the concentration of old vines. Berry fruits are developing well, giving a wine that will be generous and full bodied. The aftertaste introduces layers of acidity. Drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",29012
"2652","Inviting aromas of dark-skinned fruit, blue flower, leather and a whiff of baking spice waft out of the glass. The firm juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, licorice and hint of charcuterie while assertive, seasoned tannins provide support. Drink through 2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",2652
"104602","A spicy, bold, fruit-powered take on Pinot Noir. William Hill is the proprietor. The wine comes across as sort of a California-Oregon hybrid, mixing the slightly herbal, moderately tannic Oregon grapes with a fruit-forward, cranberry core.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104602
"29378","This wine comes from the two districts of Bué and Sancerre, from vines that are between 30 and 60 years old. A blend of richness and a tight mineral structure, it is a firm wine, full of white fruit and likely to age well. Drink from 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",29378
"92585","Aromas of exotic fruit and candied citrus zest take center stage on this deeply colored white. Reflecting the scorching vintage, it's ripe and round, offering dried apricot and nectarine drop. Enjoy soon to capture the fruit and freshness.","White","Garganega","Italy",92585
"104483","Slightly sour aromas of red cherry, dark chocolate and a pinch of crushed anise show on this wine made by a Thousand Oaks family with deep Italian winemaking roots. The bell pepper and black pepper elements on the palate blend nicely with sour cherry and tart cranberry fruits, held together by rather sticky tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",104483
"106039","This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",106039
"4042","The winery's coolest, lightest Syrah, this is an elegant, ethereal wine, sanguine and gamy with an abundance of white pepper and blueberry. Complex, it takes on a thick middle before finishing lean and soft.","Red","Syrah","US",4042
"38904","This fine wine is made in larger quantities than many of the producer's other offerings, affording a chance to be introduced to a lovely white characteristic of the vintage and region in its friendly waves of pineapple, lemon and Gravenstein apple. Chalky on the palate at first, it provides a medium body and length with a back note of herb and anise.","White","Chardonnay","US",38904
"75173","This Messias family vineyard is close to their main winery in Bairrada. The wine, with its proportion of Baga, is full of acidity as well as tannins and black-currant fruit. It offers a touch of saltiness as well as spice. The wine is just approaching maturity so drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",75173
"50969","This is a dark, inky Petite Sirah, dense in tannins and full-bodied. It basically takes command of the palate and puts up a wall of astringency. That's young Petite Sirah for you. Behind that wall are rich flavors of blackberries and currants, with a generous sweetness from toasty oak, and finished with a hit of acidity. You should cellar this wine for at least six years.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",50969
"64713","Light and textured, it's packed with lime and lemon flavors with a hint of sage. As dry as a bone, it's very much for food and is ready to drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",64713
"55816","Chewy tannins surround an elegant, structured wine, classic in red cassis, licorice and woody herbs. Powerful, it retains balance from start to finish, exuding the warmth of the vintage with the relative coolness of the appellation, marrying the two sides expertly together.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55816
"23216","Okay for everyday sipping, but there are problems. The wine is watery and thin in citrus flavors, which accentuates the acids and makes it sharp, almost sour. And there's a candy-sweet finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",23216
"60839","This is a structured wine, showing the firm tannins of a 2010 Beaujolais. Under the dry surface, the rich, juicy fruit is there, balanced with acidity, red fruit and a dense texture. Age for at least another year.","Red","Gamay","France",60839
"34315","Charred and oaky at first, the nose on this aged Rioja reserva also deals blueberry, lemon peel and spiced plum aromas. Tight, acidic and grabby on the palate, this is healthy but forced in feel. Flavors of briny oak, black currant and salt finish with bold acidity and choppiness. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",34315
"104983","This is a fine fruity wine with young tannins that will soon integrate. Ripe with berry flavors and with attractive acidity, it will develop quickly and should be ready by 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",104983
"93081","A great California bubbly, right up at the top. It's unusual for a sparkling wine house to hold back their basic vintage brut this long, but J did, and consumers benefit. The wine has some bottle age, and is softly picking up nutty, dried fruit, floral and yeasty notes. Enormously complex, it should continue to develop for many years.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",93081
"80085","Produced from old vines in the Grand Cru vineyards of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, this is a beautifully crisp, ripe wine, showing taut fruit and fine, stylish acidity. As a Special Club bottling, it adheres to stringent qualitative guidelines set out by an elite group of growers. Still young, it will be best from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",80085
"64012","There's lots of espresso, roasted coffee bean and toasted wood on the nose that carry over to the palate along with black plum and vanilla. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent wood tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",64012
"1286","A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1286
"3927","Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.","Red","Syrah","US",3927
"31769","Initial aromas of lactic oak and sawdust show on the nose, although with time this wine shows more appealing scents of smoky spice and black fruits. Woody and round in feel, this soft Carmenère offers char, hickory and blackberry flavors in front of a plump finish. Drink now.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",31769
"96398","The nose on this is an eye-opener, with its opulent berries, mocha spice and smoked meat. The flavors are delicious and subtle, offering crisp minerality, soft fruit and pepper in a successful blend.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",96398
"20121","In this vintage, Monsanto's flagship wine, made from 90% Sangiovese Grosso, is a prime example of traditional Chianti. It features racy, dry cherry fruit, hard edges and structure galore. Whether it will evolve into a more open and friendly wine remains to be seen; normally Il Poggio ages well and improves in the bottle.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",20121
"53955","Oak, leather, menthol, blue flower and stewed prune aromas lead the way. The tart, taut palate offers dried cherry, raw cranberry, clove and a green note of powdered sage while astringent tannins clench the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",53955
"16308","Shows the sweet richness of Napa Valley. It has candied flavors of blackberries and cherries, wrapped into firm, polished tannins. A pretty wine, it should show its best over the next four years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",16308
"15108","This Chardonnay has all the bells and whistles the winemaker can bestow on it. It's soft and creamy, with flavors of sweetly-sour pineapple and lemon-drop candy, buttered toast and savory cinnamon spices. Fine acidity gives a sheen to the richness.","White","Chardonnay","US",15108
"95305","A wine for those who want something drier and crisper than the typically overoaked white Rhône blend. It's smooth, silky and earthy, with just a touch of orange and sandalwood. A very nice, elegant and versatile wine.","White","White Blend","US",95305
"2185","Fresh berry, mint, cola and herb aromas make for a classic Maipo bouquet. Feels fresh and good, with plying tannins and bright acidity. Tastes earthy, mossy and herbal, with ample berry fruit. Licorice and prune flavors carry the finish. Syrah with Cabernet, Carmenère and Petit Verdot.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",2185
"91210","Made for early drinking, this bright wine delivers red berry fruit lightly accented with sage and baking spices. It's not an ager so enjoy now through 2020.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",91210
"38699","One of Chile's more personality-driven Syrahs is Maycas, from Limarí. It's a condensed, meaty and structured wine with mineral, toast and ribald blackberry aromas. The palate is rich but well built, with plum, berry, herb and chocolate flavors. Warm and long on the finish, and layered. Sophisticated enough to give the world's better-made Syrahs a run for their money.","Red","Syrah","Chile",38699
"86309","A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this has fruity aromas of dark-skinned berry along with a whiff of all spice. The fresh easygoing palate shows blackberry, black cherry and a hint of ground pepper accompanied by soft tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",86309
"84710","High-grade oaky aromas of vanilla and baking spices mix with modest mature berry fruit and animal notes on the nose of this dense tannic mature Rioja. Oaky flavors of sawdust and wood resin share space on the palate with spicy dried cherry and plum. Drink through 2024.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",84710
"56941","A very great success, although it is expensive. Shows perfect Dry Creek Zinny character, with briary, brambly wild forest berry fruit, cola and spices, and a savory note of grilled meat. The finish is dry and balanced. More than half the oak barrels were new French, giving the wine a rich coat of toast. Drink this beauty now and over the next eight years.","Red","Zinfandel","US",56941
"87692","This darkly inclined Pinot Noir is the top-end bottling from one of Edna Valley's premiere producers. Black raspberry, crushed clove and iced tea form the nose. Those midnight elements carry to the palate, with rich blackberry, thick coffee and black tea flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87692
"96087","This lusciously ripened Bordeaux-style red is plush and plump in flavor yet exceedingly light on its feet. Approachable and yielding, its ruddy red cherry and berry flavors seem coated in milk chocolate. Fresh acidity and bold tannins lend structure to the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",96087
"84755","With a soft mouthfeel and upfront cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors, this Cabernet puts all its chips on sheer deliciousness. It's a winner, but not an ager. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",84755
"63565","Very ripe fruit and a long bottle maturation gives this wine considerable concentration, richness and exotic flavors of ripe apricots, mandarin oranges and an extra layer of spice. The acidity keeps it all  together.","White","Pinot Blanc","Austria",63565
"100222","While round and supple in style, this has a puckering note of sour plums that mingle amid ripe blackberry and cherry flavors. It's uniquely tart and rich, but nuanced with fine, layered tannins and just a touch of brine that lingers on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",100222
"97922","Earthy, smoky mineral tones extend from nose to finish here, accentuating flavors of fresh red apple, tangerine and lemon. The sharp, racy mouthfeel is softened by hints of honey and a long, salt and citrus finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",97922
"2487","This fragrant blend of 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Vespolina opens with enticing scents of violet, rose, truffle and baking spice. The chewy, accessible palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry compote, white pepper and cinnamon while smooth supple tannins provide the framework. An almond note closes the finish. Drink through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",2487
"27331","Funky aromas of gumdrop and stale fruit are none too appealing. This lacks definition on the palate, while flavors of melon, candied berry and cotton candy are muddled. The finish lacks crispness.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",27331
"74650","This is an oaky Chardonnay with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors that overlay rich apricot, tangerine and tropical fruits. The opulence is balanced with crisp acidity. It's all a bit forward and obvious, but in a good way.","White","Chardonnay","US",74650
"88436","This faint, elusive wine takes lightness and low alcohol to pronounced levels, offering intense lemon and Asian pear around a tight core of acidity. From the Pratt Vineyard, it spent time aging in both new air-dried Vosges oak barrels and small stainless steel.","White","Chardonnay","US",88436
"19585","Generous barrel aromas of vanilla and wood spice are followed full-bodied, no-holds-barred fruit and vanilla flavors. There are good things going on but the wood steals the show.","Red","Syrah","US",19585
"58739","This simple wine offers up subdued sensations of raw berries and a hint of mocha but it lacks fruit richness. It's already very evolved and should be drunk soon.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",58739
"15384","Only the juice at the heart of the pressing is used to make this attractive and ripely fruity wine. It has a soft, full texture with juicy acidity and generous tannins. The wine is dense, packed with red plum and berry flavors and finished with just the right, fresh acidity. Drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",15384
"48842","This is a ripe and fruity wine, with soft tannins and rich raspberry fruits. Already accessible, it's very full in the mouth, wonderfully juicy and jammy, yet with some freshness at the end.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48842
"18895","This is a rich, perfumed wine, with spice from new wood, a rich texture and dense red berry fruit. Its structure and concentration suggest it will age further, so wait until late 2018 to drink.","Red","Red Blend","France",18895
"56552","Intensely aromatic, with gooseberries, cat pee and a strong dose of flint smoke all rounded out by pink grapefruit flavors that persist on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Italy",56552
"44030","This combines all five predominant red Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon dominant at 41% Cabernet Sauvignon. It opens in a juicy core of black raspberry and cherry, vibrant in lively acidity. Integrated oak and tannin make it feel richer and fuller than it is, which is elegant and food-friendly.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",44030
"77058","Very crisp and packed with fruit, this is an attractive, lightly mineral wine. It is fresh, full of green apples and lime, with a juicy apricot aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",77058
"4626","From one of Germany's few biodynamic producers, this combines struck flint and honeyed ripeness on the nose, then offers apple, citrus and fennel-like flavors. Despite the medium body, the acids are bracing and almost sharp on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",4626
"90721","A small-production Pinot that's earthy in just-picked strawberry, this offers light color and smooth, soft, silky tannins that have integrated well, though the wine remains young and fresh in the glass. It becomes weightier on the finish, expressing just the right amount of oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90721
"33496","The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine is decadently rich and forward in pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate, seasoned with anise, cinnamon and pepper. Firm tannins give much-needed structure to this deliciously dry Cab Franc.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",33496
"97789","Here's a Sicilian dessert wine that stands out in a crowd thanks to its layered aromas of dried herbs, natural rubber, apricot, honey and citrus blossom. The wine boasts floral and fragrant flavors that enhance the natural sweetness you feel in the mouth.","White","Moscato","Italy",97789
"52769","A young, 100% varietal and estate-farmed wine, this is a soft, thick and dusty gathering of chocolate and blackberry jam, filled in with wild game and leather. Robust and still tightly wound, it needs to open in the glass to unveil further complexities of texture and black pepper.","Red","Syrah","US",52769
"96503","Terra Rossa Riserva is a bright, compact Sangiovese-based wine with aromas of ripe berry, moist earth and pipe tobacco. That earthy quality is nice, and suggests a pairing with whole-grain pasta with cheese.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",96503
"9742","There are some unripe, vegetal flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and simple, although it does boast some cherry and currant flavors, and has a nice, silky texture. Ready now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9742
"27427","Copper peach and orange in color, this light, dry wine is soft and refreshing. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry don't overwhelm on the palate. It finishes crisp and ready for another sip.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27427
"1502","This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.","White","Chardonnay","US",1502
"93940","Marked by rich, ripe fruit, this Cabernet explodes in blackberries, cherries and cedar. There's an earthy-sweet richness, like milk chocolate, and the tannins are thick, but soft, like velvet. Ready to drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",93940
"68572","A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",68572
"83613","This is your everyday Cab, dry and tannic, but with rich, ripe black currant and cassis flavors that lead to the long finish. Drink now, but you'll want to decant it for a few hours.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",83613
"35776","Well etched, defined and crisp, this is a strong, determined wine with loads of power, acidity and firmness. The wine shows all the criteria for a long cellar life, softening slowly as the wine evolves. Age 10–20 more years.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",35776
"8248","The style at Domaines Ott has changed to become fresher and less oxidative, and the wine fits the new look. It is vivid, crisp, a rich texture giving fresh berry fruit and a light layer of acidity.","Rosé","Rosé","France",8248
"18452","Ripe aromas of burnt sugar, mango and pineapple introduce this bold, expansive Gewürztraminer. Drier on the palate than Keuka Spring's regular label Gewürztraminer, it boasts fresh lychee, rose petal and grapefruit flavors tied together with a bristling thread of astringency.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",18452
"21789","Showing a huge improvement over the '06, Novy's '07 Grenache is rich in chocolaty blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit, but beautifully structured. The firm tannins and crisp acids balance out the slightly sweet jammy flavors and lead to true elegance.","Red","Grenache","US",21789
"34851","This is full-bodied, offering subtle cashew and melon shadings alongside bold pineapple fruit. The oak stands a little apart on the palate, imparting a touch of dryness to the bright fruit. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",34851
"30033","Has an old-fashioned, rustic quality, an acidic, bone-dry wine with sour cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors that finish with some bitterness. Brings to mind those old-style Chiantis.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",30033
"23686","Whiffs of dark-skinned fruit, blue flowers and game take shape in the glass. The palate is rather diluted and not very expressive, offering subdued hints of black cherry and a note of pepper alongside fleeting tannins.","Red","Syrah","Italy",23686
"56443","Appealing aromas of grass, herbs and tropical fruit lead to tart, sleekly styled fruit flavors that show a touch of bitterness on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",56443
"98861","This light-bodied wine is quite unusual, as it's a rosé made from Nebbiolo grapes. It has a pinkish-copper color, peachy aromas and Rainier cherry flavors on a smooth texture. It's not too high in acidity, has a fairly broad mouthfeel and a hint of sweetness.","Rosé","Rosé","US",98861
"42420","An oversupply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has led to bargains like this wine, which delivers nectarine and white grapefruit flavors in a medium-bodied format. It's plump on the palate, then turns zippy and citrusy on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",42420
"5846","A warm easygoing wine with aromas of black cherry, menthol and earth. On the palate, the flavors were less intense, and the mint and fruit character had not entirely resolved themselves. The finish, though, was solid and it would probably benefit from a couple of years of cellaring.","Red","Barbera","Italy",5846
"9488","Savory aromas of black pepper, teriyaki-glazed steak, charcoal and elderberry jam converge for a compelling nose on this bottling. There is a strong soy richness to the sip, with grilled black plums and alder smoke flavors. It's the perfect barbecue wine.","Red","Syrah","US",9488
"71178","Concentrated and intense, this wine has a mix of sour lemon and potatoes going on aromatically. It is medium to full bodied, rather than crisp and light.","White","Pinot Gris","US",71178
"21074","So rich it's almost fat, this unctuous Gewürztraminer mingles massive floral rose petal flavors with a lightly soapy, caramel core. The fruit is soft and round and mixes up a wide variety of tropical flavors, mixed in with the oily, floral flavors of the grape. Creamy and lush, it's like a vendange tardive only dry.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",21074
"18414","This is a rich, smoky and structured wine. Black fruit and dark tannins form a dense texture with touches of licorice, spice and dark concentration. The acidity hints at the vintage giving a touch of freshness and lift. Drink this powerful wine from 2024","Red","Pinot Noir","France",18414
"37700","A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now. Give it a rest until 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",37700
"13093","The cool Côte de Lechet, facing north, produces a classically steely Chablis. This is still young, very tight and nervy, its acidity prominent even though the texture is ripe. Aging will bring balance between the crisp character and the richer green and white fruits. Drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",13093
"99865","There's a bit of fizz on this wine, which shows chalk and gummy peach candy on the nose. The palate suggests ripe apple at first then evolves into a pithy bitterness characterized by yellow grapefruit rinds.","White","Chardonnay","US",99865
"104286","This is a severe Pinot Noir, dry and acidic and unflattering to the palate. There are some good, complex cherry, currant, tea and spice flavors, but they're hard to appreciate because the wine is so tannic. It does not seem like a cellar candidate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104286
"44827","The tannins are very fine, with rich fruitcake and smoky flavors. Red berry and black plums give a fruity character, along with delicious acidity. The wine is structured while still remaining very approachable.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",44827
"82122","Smoky and oaky, this is a blend of 85% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot, creating one black, dense, vanilla-infused package that's rich and ready to drink now.","Red","Red Blend","US",82122
"21463","Roasted, rubbery aromas come with an herbal offset and mild stalky notes. This is full and rubbery feeling, with baked berry, herb and peppery flavors residing before a dry, tannic, stocky finish that's a fair conclusion to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",21463
"40351","A trove of wild strawberry wraps around a concentration of full-bodied smoothness in this deep and brooding wine marked by a juicy core and plenty of length on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40351
"49526","Very ripe pear fruit is dangerously close to tipping over into cloying richness, almost hinting at cream soda. The palate is less overwhelming. As always, that special streak of Alsace acid saves the day.","White","Pinot Gris","France",49526
"7031","A whiff of passion fruit on the nose immediately hints at ripeness. The palate fulfils that promise not only with generosity but counters it with gorgeous grapefruit freshness and a lovely zesty texture that makes this very appetizing. The flavors are zingy, clean, ripe and very, very long. It is the grapefruit spice that gets you in the end.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",7031
"9805","A perfect wine to pair with salad, grilled tuna or chicken salad, this is fresh and crisp, with bright tones of green melon and apple. The finish is zesty and clean feeling.","White","White Blend","Italy",9805
"21602","Lively and tangy, but refreshing as it captures the new Chilean style of racy Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is spritzy, with lime, orange peel and tart apple flavors. Cleansing on the finish. Good value and purity for the money.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",21602
"80660","Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this has earthy aromas of dark berry, tilled soil and a whisper of violet. The straightforward, enjoyable palate offers black cherry, crushed plum and a hint of clove. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",80660
"77555","Tropical fruit, air freshener and bath soap aromas lead to a candied, sticky palate with a mix of sweet flavors that include papaya, powdered sugar and mango. The finish is confected and soft.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",77555
"96559","Dark ruby in the glass, this wine's simple cherry fragrance does not do justice to its black cherry, blueberry, vanilla and clove flavors. It's bright from the first sip, with silky tannins and black pepper and sage notes that continue into a finish punctuated by a burst of bright cherry.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","Israel",96559
"106073","Light and easy with a great lift to the green plum, hard guava and banana notes. Lively but not overly zippy or mouth-puckering on the finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",106073
"21268","Assertive in its earthy, barnyard-like aromas, this biodynamic, Dijon-clone-based wine is light on its feet. It's ripe flavors are still developing, and it has a finish that one wishes would linger longer.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",21268
"42121","The aromas of blue and red fruit are direct and appealing, with dried herbs providing a grace note. The currant flavors are plump with lightly grainy tannins backing them up.","Red","Syrah","US",42121
"28715","This wine leads with a touch of smoke and cinnamon. The underlying blueberry fruit is brooding and crunchy, bringing freshness to the medium-bodied palate. Aromatic waves of spice and pure, vibrant fruit carry long into the finish.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",28715
"3162","Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",3162
"106535","This is classic Edna Valley Pinot Noir: dry, light bodied, with crisp acidity, modest alcohol and forward flavors of raspberry, cherry and cola. Production was just shy of 2,500 cases.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",106535
"50781","This tastes a little too high in acidity, but it does show the spiciness of Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir. Flavors of ripe black cherry, peppercorn and licorice are all found, and it shows a nice silkiness. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50781
"39277","Chewy and tannic, this has plenty of barrel flavors, but is light on the fruit. Coffee, caramel and toasty components are all here, seeming to smother any ripe fruit that might fill out the middle.","Red","Merlot","US",39277
"32355","Fresh, spicy cherry aromas are nice and clean. The palate is racy and staunch, with good acidity and tasty plum and berry flavors. Solid and medium-long on the finish, with a touch of minty herb flavor. Juicy and moderately oaky for a $10 value wine.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",32355
"94083","This is a genuine and straightforward red wine from Piedmont that would pair with oven-roasted pasta or meat loaf. The wine (made from Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina) is lean and fresh in the mouth, but ends with a very focused blast of almond and marzipan like flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",94083
"46828","The aromas are awkward, with notes of clove, green stock, bramble, linseed oil, Sambuca and spice that come from every direction. The wine is firm in the mouth with solid tannins and herbal notes on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",46828
"28199","Juicy and tart, this estate-grown Sauvignon Blanc has a pleasing mix of light melon, lime, white peach and grapefruit flavors. Hints of sweet grass and a suggestion of sweetness, like lemonade, fill out the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",28199
"76075","Produced from 40-year-old vines with Merlot dominant in the blend, this is a dark wine showing tight black-currant fruits and crisp acidity. With its texture and dry tannins still prominent in its youth, the wine needs to age so drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",76075
"82954","If you haven't puzzled it out from the name, this is a Syrah-based cuvée. Aged 14 months in second-use oak, it features dark, smoky notes on the nose to balance the bright raspberry aromas, then turns darker and meatier on the palate, ending with a hint of coffee. The tannins are supple and impart a rich texture. Drink now–2017.","Red","Syrah","France",82954
"68533","While the wine is very dense, it also has layers of very ripe fruits, plums and dark berries that give it an intensely rich character. The juicy acidity is almost overwhelming, a shock of freshness as it cuts through the concentrated texture. The wine still needs to age, so drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",68533
"62870","Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Merlot (21%), Syrah (17%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and five other varieties. Aromas of blue fruit, char, plum, herb, confection and spice are followed by easy-drinking plum flavors, with a slightly clipped finish. It's a pleasant easy drinker.","Red","Red Blend","US",62870
"88927","This has a dense bouquet, with aromas of beet, clove, mint, tomato and berry fruit. The mouthfeel is rich and saturated, with a rawness that didn't exist in prior years. Flavors of mixed herb, earth and savory berry end with a long finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",88927
"89730","The 2007 Excelsus is a gorgeous super Tuscan expression (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) that shows quality and superior fruit on all levels. Castello Banfi has really hit a home run with this vintage. You'll encounter persuasive aromas of cassis, blackberry, chocolate, tobacco, curry leaf and deep renderings of exotic spice. The wine's texture is exceedingly smooth, rich and long lasting.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",89730
"30876","Big, bold and rounded, this is a rich wine from a single vineyard. Red-plum fruits go with a plush texture that masks the firm tannins and dry core. The acidity and structure both promise long-term aging. The wine is still young, needing time. Drink this from 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",30876
"87725","The aromas seem a bit disjointed on first pour, with notes of custard, citrus, mineral and spice. The palate is medium bodied, bringing some interest but not entirely pulling it all together.","White","Chardonnay","US",87725
"66615","Direct and easy drinking, this is full of ripe blueberry aromas and flavors, framed by hints of toast and a dusting of cinnamon. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",66615
"16999","Here's a fruity Sauvignon Blanc fllled with flavors of pineapples, papayas, lemons, limes, peaches and even a hint of wild white flowers and gooseberries. The strong flavors are lifted by good acidity. Try as a stimulating cocktail wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",16999
"52048","Ripe fruit flavors and a delicious spiciness combine to make this full-bodied but not very tannic wine easy to love. It smells like cherries and raspberries, tastes full but not sweet, and has a texture that spreads and softens on the palate like melting chocolate. It's made with 50% Zinfandel and almost equal parts Syrah, Carignane and Petite Sirah.","Red","Red Blend","US",52048
"17606","This is notable for its complexity and stylish blend of grape, berry and bramble flavors. The fruit is matched with polished tannins, streaks of iron and earth, and a citrusy highlight.","Red","Syrah","US",17606
"41010","One of few Kiwi Pinots typically worth cellaring, Neudorf's 2008 Moutere bottling comes across as a bit oaky, with menthol and cedar notes forming a tight overlay to the cherry fruit. Tannins are silky yet firm, suggesting the wine will be at its best 2012–2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",41010
"58246","Richly structured, this is a wine with style and balance. It has plenty of firm tannins to contrasted with its juicy blackberry fruit. It needs some time to fill out. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",58246
"40026","This Riserva Sangiovese from Central Italy opens with sweet notes of candied fruit and cherry followed by a light and lean feeling in the mouth. Try pairing it with a simple pizza marinara (with tomato, garlic and oregano).","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",40026
"104761","Fans of dark oak will enjoy this Cab, which is big on char, green herb and dry tannins. Though there is a little plum and black cherry fruit underneath the oak, the midpalate still wants a little more oomph, and more fruit.","Red","Merlot","Chile",104761
"46318","This is a good, round, fruity style of Riesling. It's off-dry (2.6% residual sugar), with flavors of pineapple, sweet tangerine and Meyer lemon. The fruit is simply delicious; drink now.","White","Riesling","US",46318
"89267","This is a big, oaky, brawny and tannic version of the variety, generous in brown sugar and blackberry and plum jam. A piquant seasoning of peppercorn dots the midpalate and finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",89267
"93897","Supple and silky, this expressive, seductive wine offers ripe plum and cherry fruit matched to polished tannins. It's finished with tasty barrel flavors of coconut, butter pecan and toast, and it is thoroughly, irresistibly delicious.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93897
"28130","Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",28130
"59484","This wine is equal parts Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas and off-dry flavors of grass and fig seem a bit muddled but still bring enjoyment.","White","White Blend","US",59484
"39193","A rare gem, this Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is sourced entirely from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard. Aged for 10 months in one-year-old French oak, it's a spicy wine with aromatics and flavors of botanicals such as mint and quinine. Fruit is sharp with flavors of grapefruit and white peach, and hints of toast and cracker.","White","White Blend","US",39193
"51662","The wine has a murky burgundy color and earthy, roasted aromas that include Band-Aid and latex. This feels bold, tangy, tannic and hard. Flavors of plum, tomato and stalky herbs finish with a stewed note and heat.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",51662
"67275","Delicate white peach and pear notes perfume this dry, crisply fruity wine. There's a satisfying weightiness to the palate, but tart lemon notes keep it zesty and spry.","White","Pinot Gris","US",67275
"84786","A difficult wine to like. It's not quite ripe, giving a vegetal edge to the modest cherry flavors, and is cuttingly sharp in acids.","Red","Grenache","US",84786
"50460","A companion to the Helen's designate, this shows the same black cherry core, here with a streak of iron ore down the middle. Flavorful and rather fruity, its moderate acidity carries a hint of lemon.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50460
"104762","The ultralight color portends a light wine with pear and apple fruit, plenty of flowery sweetness and a surprisingly full, fresh finish. It's not a bad little wine, given its modest aspirations.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",104762
"56150","Fairly standard Pinot, but with some silky qualities of interest. It's dry and tart, but with ripe cranberry, raspberry, vanilla and spice flavors. A very tasty wine for drinking now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56150
"98387","Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded. Earthy baked black-fruit flavors show a hint of oaky coconut, while this Tempranillo finishes with depth and density.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",98387
"52257","A bit raw and rustic, with stalky flavors of black cherries, sage and black pepper. Okay with everyday fare.","Red","Merlot","US",52257
"68579","Candied, tutti-frutti aromas give this a sweet, somewhat faux bouquet with little concentration. But the palate is chewy and grabby enough, with solid but modest raspberry and red plum flavors. Mellow on the finish, with a decent feel. Good but not distinguished. Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Argentina",68579
"91868","Sharp and almost vinegar-like on the nose, with a strong blast of field greens and nettle. The palate is broad and edgy, with sour plum, tarragon and juniper flavors. Very green, herbal and funky. Not one of this label's better wines.","Red","Syrah","Chile",91868
"93683","With refreshingly tart blackberry fruit, this Zweigelt has some concentration and displays a good balance between light body, refreshing acidity and clean, lively fruit notes. A great party wine.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",93683
"69720","Beautifully perfumed in a relatively light style, this Santenay is full of red fruits, sweet tannins and mouthwatering acidity. It has some richness, although the main character is of freshness.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",69720
"59391","Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",59391
"76999","A rich, pineapple-flavored wine with a touch of smoke and roasted almonds, very citrusy at the finish. It's crisp, perfumed and fresh. Screwcap.","White","Riesling","Austria",76999
"88943","If only more California Barbera could be like this. Opening with a pretty, yet rich fruit nose of dark cherry and plum, the structured wine has been tamed into a soft, chocolate-brushed finish with just the perfect amount of acidity. The vines have been in the ground since the 1880s. Winemaker Jim Moore adds just a thimble's worth (3%) of Nebbiolo too, before letting it all age in oak.","Red","Barbera","US",88943
"56568","Tight citrus aromas meet with bubblegum and wet stone on the somewhat reserved though clean and inviting nose of this wine. The flavors are also quite light, with strawberry and lemon touches, so the point is more of the racy acidity and slight tannic grip.","Rosé","Rosé","US",56568
"15535","Despite the high alcohol level, this is classic Bordeaux, with style, elegance and fine balance between tannin and ripe black-currant fruit. It demonstrates the concentration and rich structure of the vintage, yet the finish has a light, bright, fruity touch.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",15535
"29291","This is a solid wine, full-bodied and dry, and while it's a little rustic on its own, barbecue will elevate it. Blended from the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, as well as 10% Syrah, its blackberry and cherry fruit is complexed with smoked meat and tamari, set off with crisp acidity. Drink now–2015.","Red","Red Blend","US",29291
"73741","Ripe fruit with soft acidity chracterize this wine that has great concentration, jammy flavors, strawberry jelly and a generous plum skin texture.","Red","Gamay","France",73741
"95242","Tart and angular on the nose, with sharp red berry and plum aromas. Crisp and acidic, with sweet-and-sour flavors in front of a tight, clean, short finish. Fresh but high in acidity and veering towards tart.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",95242
"39134","This dark-colored wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, is rich, perfumed and dense. It has impressive tannins and rich blackberry fruit. The structure is concentrated, giving the wine power as well as a sense of style. This ripe wine is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",39134
"87012","Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins. It gives a wine that could benefit from aging while also being ready to drink now. Give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until 2016.","Red","Red Blend","France",87012
"80292","Brick dust, tomato paste, oregano and basil aromas control the nose on this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend. The palate is narrow in feel, while flavors of roasted berry, vanilla, mocha and burnt caramel finish creamy and warm, with good texture and modest complexity.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",80292
"10652","Yeasty, honeyed aromas are unfocused. This shows a combination of chunky weight and citric acidity on the palate along with oak-heavy flavors led by clove. Bland peach and apple flavors don't stand up to the wine's oak character.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",10652
"80614","There's a pungent lanolin-like aroma on the nose of this bottling, while wet clay and char notes lend nuance to its black fruit. The palate offers density and tannic depth, with dried mint and blackberry jam flavors that extend into the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",80614
"41834","Citrus, confectioner's sugar and papaya are the opening act for this simple but pleasant sparkler. It's light in the mouth, with noticeable sweetness but a kick of lemony acidity at the end leaves you feeling refreshed. Drink soon, preferably while watching the tide come in.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",41834
"13106","Whiffs of smoke and struck flint persist from nose to finish, lending dramatic minerality to this otherwise juicy, fruity Riesling. Sunny peach and tangerine flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but it's a refreshing wine with a honed elegance throughout.","White","Riesling","Germany",13106
"21950","This pure varietal bottling spent two years in barrel. It's extremely leathery, dried out, and smells and tastes of the tack room. This is not terroir. It's most likely barrel-related.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21950
"87048","Tank fermented, then aged in neutral French oak, this has a tawny cast to it and a soft, slightly woody flavor. The lemony flavor finishes with a mildly bitter fruit-skin note.","White","Viognier","US",87048
"31625","Lemon rinds, green apple skins, white flowers and a hint of pineapple guava decorate the nose of this wine from a former race car driver. It has tons of chalky mineral zing on the palate, which is crisp and light with grassy flavor and pithy grip.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",31625
"64020","This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",64020
"18512","An elegant Chardonnay from Anderson Valley's cool vineyards, this is fruity and accessible, but also nuanced with hints of beeswax, vanilla and delicate lemon. Subtly oaked, it finishes with a note of candied fruit.","White","Chardonnay","US",18512
"81121","Touched by caramel, this is a bone-dry rosé, very crisp and fruity, with raspberry, red cherry.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",81121
"56480","Aromas of black currant, French oak, coconut and espresso lead the nose on this polished easygoing Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah blend. The soft accessible palate doles out black cherry, mocha and black pepper alongside supple tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",56480
"88686","This meaty, ripe Syrah is smoky and deep on the nose, with lusty berry aromas. The palate is tannic but supported by bold, fleshy blackberry flavors backed by maple, vanilla and burnt toast. Caramel richness makes its way onto the finish, which is rocky and tannic but tastes good. This value Syrah was built for grilled meat.","Red","Syrah","Argentina",88686
"694","This does a good job of balancing lively pear and apple flavors with dashes of toast and butter. It's medium to full-bodied, dry and has enough crispness to help the flavors linger.","White","Chardonnay","US",694
"82092","Drink this charming Merlot now for its soft, sweet richness of fruit. With a touch of smoky oak, it shows cherry, red currant and mocha flavors that are wrapped into polished tannins.","Red","Merlot","US",82092
"73050","A pretty good Syrah, although there's something generic about it. Rich and soft, it has black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and bacon flavors, and the tannins are silky. Drink this sweetly fruity wine now.","Red","Syrah","US",73050
"88343","Extremely flavorful and wonderfully exotic, this full-bodied wine has intense fruit flavors like raspberry and rhubarb, with a host of interesting accents recalling cedar, white pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is warm and rich, tannins are soft and easy, and the finish lingers nicely.","Red","Grenache","US",88343
"105603","This fruity, crisp wine offers layers of acidity and bright fruit, with a refreshing burst of red currants. It's delicious and ready to drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",105603
"36532","The future of Finger Lakes Sauvingnon Blanc is bright, at least in the hands of Steve Shaw. Fragrant with sweet, ripe gooseberries, apples and a touch of herbs and grass, this is a delicious choice for any occasion. Full bodied and complex, its palate is lush with quince and green plums, highlighted by a refreshing minerality and a lime zest astringency.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",36532
"51206","Aromas of plum, blueberry, vanilla and spice are followed by plush, ample fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal, with baking-spice flavors lingering on the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",51206
"14903","The nose is rather closed but this bursts into life in the mouth with lip-smacking citrus freshness and notions of tart stone fruit along a linear, driven palate. Whistle-clean and just a little bracing, this is a textbook Riesling from the fresh 2014 vintage. It's light-bodied but shows lots of verve.","White","Riesling","Austria",14903
"77896","A brawny, super-sized blend of 40% Syrah, 35% Petit Verdot and 25% Cabernet Franc, this comes from Atlas Peak's Stagecoach Vineyard. Dense black fruit, tar, brick and bacon define this wine, which is full bodied and leathery on the palate.","Red","Red Blend","US",77896
"87465","Yellow in color, with floral, citrusy aromas. Not a whole lot of definition to the palate; it's wet but dilute, with unrefined, nonproprietary citrus flavors.","White","Verdejo","Spain",87465
"44082","A light and crisp wine that has a creamed apple texture. It is fruity, light with a fine citrus tang to add to the general freshness of the wine. The name suggests a very appropriate pairing.","White","Melon","France",44082
"63289","Fermented in large barrels to preserve the fruit, this is a dense wine, full of the ripe red-berry and black-plum flavor that's layered with mint and new wood notes. Juicy, rich and concentrated, this is worth aging for at least five years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",63289
"100047","Lush fruits of boysenberry, plump raspberry and strawberry mesh with vanilla, nutmeg and allspice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard off Drum Canyon Road. Black cherry and more vanilla make for a rich palate, but it's cut by an edge of acidity, darker elderberry, savory shiitake and a bay-leaf character that rises on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100047
"20957","Lots of ripe, pleasurable flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, plums and oak in this dry, nicely structured Cabernet. It's pretty tannic, though, with a tough astringency, and doesn't have the fruit to outlast the tannins over time, so give it a decant and drink soon.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",20957
"104610","Made in a more popular style than Calera's Mt. Harlan bottling, this Chard features lush flavors of pineapple and orange jam, honey and vanilla. The acidity is bright and mouthwatering.","White","Chardonnay","US",104610
"66093","This plump, succulent spätlese starts off with apple and citrus aromas, then delivers intensely mineral flavors reminiscent of crushed vitamins and green apples. Crisp and citrusy on the finish, with a fine sense of poise and balance.","White","Riesling","Germany",66093
"9504","Baked blackberries meet with caramel, vanilla, forest floor and a tart plum skin touch on the nose of this bottling by the Paso Robles-based Tooth & Nail team. It's smooth and soft on the sip, with black currant, elderberry, pepper dust, charcoal and rosemary flavors. It's ripe but with a very dry edge.","Red","Syrah","US",9504
"23190","Suave aromas of pepper, elderberry, lavender and a touch of snapped sagebrush show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers slightly sour black fruits of tart plum skin and boysenberry, rounded by a savory soy component.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",23190
"31661","Ripe and robust, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, pressed rose, cake spice and a balsamic note. The juicy, generous palate delivers fleshy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice, white pepper and tobacco alongside big chewy tannins and the warmth of alcohol.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",31661
"30944","This wine is tight and austere. It still shows the smoky wood aging that has left a bitter chocolate character in the wine. It should soften, although it will likely end up lean. The blend is 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",30944
"54185","Jumpy, spunky aromas of red berries and latex feed into an astringent, tannic palate with tart plum and raspberry flavors.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",54185
"51820","Coming from a mixture of Mirage and Blackrock vineyards, this wine offers aromas of baking spice, vanilla and dark fruit. These are followed by full-bodied black-cherry and spice flavors along with gritty tannins. It dips a bit in the middle and the oak seems a bit heavy, but it still delivers enjoyment.","Red","Merlot","US",51820
"89288","This bottling brings strawberry preserves right up front; it's a light and spicy wine with immediate appeal. There's plenty of acid—rarely an issue in Oregon—but not much depth. It's got fruit and malted chocolate, and the finish lasts a bit longer than you might expect from the light fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",89288
"31309","Made from grapes that have been exposed to muffa nobile or botrytis, this lovely dessert wine boasts sensations of candied fruit, dried apricot, almond and ripe yellow peach. The rich flavors are balanced with freshness, making it an ideal meditation wine to sip after dinner or pair it with seasoned cheeses.","White","White Blend","Italy",31309
"69085","Aromas of ripe, dark-skinned berry and crushed violet emerge from this vibrant blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese. The  savory palate doles out black cherries and black currants accented with notes of toast and ground pepper. It's already accessible and made to be enjoyed young.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",69085
"43352","Though without the richness that has defined California Cab in recent decades, this bottling is more of a classic Old World-leaning expression that is slowly coming back in vogue. Tightly wound blackberry meets with cigar box, dust and dried oregano on the nose, while the palate combines a strong tannic profile and solid acidity with more dried herbs, crushed slate, black olive and dark fruits.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43352
"42166","This blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot is bitter and astringent.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",42166
"30329","Briary berry aromas come with hints of leather and animal. This feels dense, jammy and a bit gummy, while flavors of blueberry, chocolate and baked black plum finish chewy and a touch sticky.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",30329
"80787","A mature Champagne, this shows as much toast and cookie character as fruit, making it soft, ripe and delicious. The fruit moves toward tropical, with pineapple and peach flavors. It is not a wine to age.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",80787
"70288","Whiffs of candle wax and crushed minerals lend depth to the concentrated tangerine and honey flavors in this sun-kissed, citrusy kabinett. It's forward and fruity yet zippy and fresh, showing balanced acidity and a cool, mineral finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",70288
"71618","This is one of those Chardonnays that takes ripe fruit and then drenches it in oak. It's all too much. The orange, apricot and mango flavors have a buttered toast, caramelized richness that turns cloying despite brisk acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",71618
"60906","Black cherry to the eye, this wine holds back on the nose, offering restrained aromas of black currant and roasted yellow pepper. Flavors include raspberry, blueberry, violet, lavender, thyme and roasted meat. It has lightly grippy tannins and there is a distinct note of Dr. Pepper on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Israel",60906
"46261","The slightly oxidized nose on this wine, which is sourced from the K Block at Bien Nacido Vineyard and Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard, shows seared marshmallow, hot Marcona almonds and honey, with a noticeable alkalinity. The browned-butter palate is cut by a lemon peel zing that evolves into truffle salt and roasted nuts. All elements linger deep into the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",46261
"45490","You can't beat this low price. No wonder Vitiano is a constant feature on wine lists at restaurants across Rome. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese offers spicy oak notes, with suggestions of ripe cherry, blackberry and spice.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",45490
"51434","An intriguing nose of slight but very pleasant smokiness with mere edges of peat and earth leads onto a notion of black cherry. The dark palate is framed by specks of pepper, bringing nuance to this structured wine. Still young, this wine has the ability to go some distance. Drink now-2019.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",51434
"56662","Pungent and sweaty, this makes an immediate impact on the nose. That vibrancy carries over onto the plushly textured palate and electric, mouthwatering finish. A fun, flashy wine for near-term consumption.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",56662
"68747","This is the second label for Col Solare, the Ste. Michelle-Antinori collaboration on Red Mountain. Except for a splash of Syrah, it's a Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and three other Bordeaux grapes, mostly sourced from the recently planted estate vineyard on Red Mountain. Mixed black-fruit flavors come dusted with baking spice, plus notes of olive, cedar and coffee.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",68747
"31333","This wine is perfumed, with delicious notes of plum and spice that are balanced by light tannins and fine, elegant acids. A touch of mineral marks the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",31333
"21325","This is the first Grüner fruit from Underwood Mountain, and it promises good—maybe great—things to come. Sleek and stony, the wine epitomizes the racy, slightly grassy, slightly peppery quality of classic Austrian Grüner, with a Pacific Northwest twist—a certain brilliant intensity to the fruit that reflects this northern latitude. Clearly the best Grüner from Oregon or Washington to date.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",21325
"40004","Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",40004
"104971","Tight, light and layered in freshly baked bread and firm cherry and cranberry, this is a soft, rounded Pinot from an inland Sonoma Coast site that's balanced, food-friendly and ready to enjoy now through 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104971
"1656","This is light, fruity and fresh for a Gewurztraminer. A crisp character brings out bitter orange and ripe pear flavors. Drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",1656
"20177","The winery specializes in Zinfandel. While the Maboroshi Vineyard has produced great Pinots for other wineries, this one is tough in tannins. Give it a good, long decant and drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20177
"102232","This is an elegant and refined Barolo with focused aromas of black fruit, drying mineral and root beer. There's also a playful side that emerges thanks to the wine's ripe and plush mouthfeel. Sure, it's a structured, tannic wine but its fine texture helps make it approachable within the next five years or so.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",102232
"64126","Ground pepper, tilled earth and black-skinned berry aromas all come together on this generous, full-bodied red. The fresh, delicious palate doles out ripe black cherry, black currant, licorice and clove alongside vibrant acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.","Red","Barbera","Italy",64126
"104327","Ultraripe black currant, chocolate, date and oak flavors mark this Cabernet. It's as rich as Raymond's other District Collection Cabs, yet somehow has greater vitality and energy. Drink now, after decanting, and through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",104327
"9301","Blackberry, black cherry and blueberry aromas are cut by complex hints of dark chocolate and nutmeg on this Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend. The tannins are quite firm on the palate, framing black plums, vanilla, caramel, dill and dried mint flavors. Drinking 2018–2030 will allow more black cherry and blueberry character to evolve on the sip.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",9301
"98885","Woodbridge makes two styles of Chardonnay, and this is the richer one. Attractive layering of fruit, cream and hazelnut flavors on a nicely viscous texture makes this full-bodied wine something special. It has a good sense of concentration and depth, along with a lingering finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",98885
"69480","Owned by the Trocard family since 1628, this vineyard has produced a rich and rounded 2010. Dominated by Merlot, it is solid, concentrated and ripe. Acidity cuts through the richness to give a full and fruity character at the end. Drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",69480
"52223","Like the label says, this is an everyday sort of wine. It's crisp in acids and off-dry, with pleasant orange, pineapple, lemon and vanilla flavors.","White","White Blend","US",52223
"54944","A lovely blend from the Languedoc comprised of 60% Cabernet Franc, 30% Syrah and 10% Merlot. The nose and mouth offers loads of menthol and garrigue herbs (especially lavender) along side bright small red berries and sweet green pepper. Medium weight and well structured with a lengthy finish.","Red","Red Blend","France",54944
"31120","Perfumed with rose and lavender, this wine has robust tannins and dominant oak notes, both in support of its ripe, concentrated red fruit. Woody, herbal components complement the lushness, framed by gravelly texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31120
"58954","Something of the structure of Morey is here in this wine. However it is surprisingly ready to drink, with the tannins in the background leaving the foreground to juicy red-berry fruits and fresh acidity. It is attractive and balanced; drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",58954
"35897","A solid effort from a dependable winery that used to be known for value, back before wine—especially Cabernet—prices exploded. It hits all the right notes, with black-currant aromas and flavors, herbal or bell-pepper notes and a fancy streak of mint, complexed with lots of new French oak. Dry and rich, it finishes with dusty tannins, suggesting aging possibilities. Best after 2003.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",35897
"3446","The winery's larger-production blend of several vineyard sources, given 20 months in American oak, this wine opens in pungent earth, soy and mushroom, reminiscent of a beef bouillon or beef stew. Big tannins surround the fruit, accented in black licorice and black coffee before finishing lean.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",3446
"88583","This cheeky blend of Chardonnay and Bordeaux-inspired Sauvignon Blanc is delicately framed. Fresh and fruity, it discloses apple and lemon notes accented with hints of smoke and savory nuts.","White","White Blend","US",88583
"12055","The nose is a tad reductive at this point this wine's life, so it will probably only improve in the year to come. But it's exciting now as well, with candied lemon and dewy oregano on the nose leading into a racy palate full of sizzling acidity and grippy texture that clings to the mouth. A candied apple component flashes at the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",12055
"70602","Richly textured and full-bodied, a wine to drink now with fine steaks and chops. Almost sweet, it's opulent in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with a decadent hint of chocolate. But it's fully dry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70602
"38564","Lemon cream, spice and lanolin notes add a mysterious veil to this delicate yet intensely concentrated Riesling. It's sweet on the palate with ripe, honeyed citrus, and a delicious mineral oil sheen that lengthens the palate.","White","Riesling","Germany",38564
"50762","This is classic Pinot Blanc, with pretty white flowers on the nose, a slight spritz enhancing lemony flavors in the mouth and a crisp, refreshing finish. Perfect for poolside sipping, particularly if there is some fish on the grill.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",50762
"77206","There are regular, small explosions of citrus on the slender, taut palate of this exciting Wachau Riesling. This is so lively and energetic that you just want to keep sipping. It is slender, brisk and crisp and leaves the mouth feeling totally clean and invigorated. Not for the faint-hearted but thrilling for true acidhounds.","White","Riesling","Austria",77206
"23831","No one does a better job with the Syrah from this vineyard than Mark Ryan McNeilly. Here, the peppery, just-ripe fruit is washed in a caramel bath. The flavors are long, and despite all of the barrel influence, the grapes have the muscle and texture to stand out equally.","Red","Syrah","US",23831
"24541","Fruit and wood combine for a seductive intro: the sonorous, soothing notes of vanilla unite ripe, aromatic blueberry fruit, floral overtones and rounded spice. This is smooth and pliant with an all-velvet core on a fullish body. Blueberry echoes long after the last sip.","Red","Red Blend","Austria",24541
"10733","Roasted and earthy smelling, with a pinch of iodine and even a whiff of bacon or ham. Rich, full and a touch sticky on the tongue, with baked berry and chocolate flavors. Mellow and sweet on the back end. 100% Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Peru",10733
"104631","For lovers of the bone-dry Riesling style, this exceptional effort could become the poster child. Astringent and crisply defined, with elegant focus, this grapefruit- and citrus-scented wine boasts powerful minerality, estate-grown definition and a resonant, lingering finish.","White","Riesling","US",104631
"30380","There's quite a showy, fragrant nose on this widely available bottling, with apple blossoms, tuberose and a touch of quinine. The palate also takes on a gin-and-tonic character, powered by lime juice, white peach and botanical notes.","White","Chardonnay","US",30380
"76943","Here's a well-priced Chardonnay from Sicily with a light and luminous feel followed by fresh aromas of citrus, stone fruit and white mineral. Pair this crisp white wine with seafood or salads.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",76943
"93301","Clean and firm, with strawberry fruit and an earthy base. Hints of compost and tobacco came through in both the scents and flavors, while tannins were moderately coarse. Drink soon.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",93301
"53929","Jim Clendenen may be the only West Coast vintner making this blend of 50% Pinot Gris, 40% Pinot Blanc and 10% Aligoté, but more should copy. Aromas of musk melon, orange rose petals, crushed chalk and candied peaches lead into a palate powered by sea salt-laced nectarines, ripe red apples and honeydew, all tied together with proper acidity.","White","White Blend","US",53929
"52685","With a handful of Viognier blended in, and nine months spent in new French oak, this wine offers deep layers of melon and peach surrounded by a wall of floral aromatics. Delicious and ripe, the wine holds enough structure to hold well for another couple of years.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",52685
"91208","Argile is French for clay soil, and that terroir gives this wine a full-bodied feel that is ripe and rich. The Sauvignon flavors lean more to tropical, rounded and fruity. It could benefit from some aging, so wait until 2015.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",91208
"21800","Blueberry, wet tobacco, charred beef, cedar and a touch of dried herbs show on the nose of this bottling. There is tons of acidity on the palate, where dense and dark purple fruits meet with cocoa dust, incense and woody spice, culiminating in a long finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21800
"87199","Some might say this is old-school Oregon Pinot, with an emphasis on herbal acidic flavors and thin tart fruits. Despite aggressive aeration, the wine refuses to open up, and the impression of barely ripe fruit and chalky acids lingers.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87199
"95094","This is a cool-climate Zweigelt, with a spicy, juicy fruit character and light tannins. The red fruit and green herb flavors are layered with acidity.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",95094
"67020","A fair amount of herbaceousness shows on the nose and palate, a dry combustion of tannin, gunpowder and green herb. Full bodied, it has chalky tannins that desiccate on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",67020
"11544","Huber's entry-level bottling comes across as somewhat conflicted in 2008, with aromas of mushrooms and twigs, but flavors more reminiscent of ripe cherries; plump and round in the mouth, but crisply acidic, almost zingy on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",11544
"28371","Dramatically ripe, this delicately framed spätlese is a showcase of pristine, sunny peach and Meyer lemon flavors accented by caramel and crystallized honey. It's nuanced as well, darting with acidity and touches of sea salt and slate that persist.","White","Riesling","Germany",28371
"85782","Intensely herbaceous, this is almost too fruity and crisp for its own good. It's dominated by juicy citrus fruits, gooseberries and forward acidity. Drink from 2015.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",85782
"43233","The wine is spicy, fruity with soft tannins and plenty of ripe red berries. Its dry core gives it shape along with a firm anchor for the generous fruitiness. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",43233
"35984","Broadly fruity at first, this turns a little loose-knit, like a Grateful Dead jam. It's compelling but not terribly tight; it meanders into leaf and tea, then chocolate, then back to the light and pretty red fruits.","Red","Syrah","US",35984
"8569","Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate. Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8569
"9581","A blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 30% Syrah, this has aromas of red currant, cedar and a whiff of white pepper. The straightforward, easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, clove, coffee and licorice alongside polished tannins. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",9581
"37026","Roasted aromas of tomato and red plum are spicy. This has a chunky, blocky mouthfeel that's searching for its groove. Herbal plum and tomato flavors finish a bit raw in feel and salty in flavor.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",37026
"12583","Pointy on the nose, with modest fruit aromas suggestive of raspberry. A bit astringent across the palate, with red plum flavors that hit hard then fade fast, leaving bitterness akin to espresso. A crisp, juicy, tight style.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",12583
"22764","Rich and full bodied, despite the relatively low alcohol, this supertart and luscious Riesling is loaded with sour candy flavors of lemon and lime. Quite refreshing, pure and dry.","White","Riesling","US",22764
"67236","This blend of Petit Verdot (65%) and Cabernet Sauvignon is an aromatic brooder, with notes of lemon peel, flowers and cherry. Bright acidity livens up the palate, which is full of cherry flavors and well-integrated tannins. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",67236
"52169","On the lean side, with a layered concentrated wood structure. The wine has weight along with dryness, although the fruit is harder to discern.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",52169
"94149","Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",94149
"87393","This is waxy smelling, with a coastal vegetal note that conveys cool-climate grapes. The palate is short and clipped in feel, with a waxy, mealy note to the wine's core melon and peach flavors. It's chunky on the finish and is a touch mealy in taste.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",87393
"50950","This is a ripe, generous wine that speaks of the sun and warmth of the Alentejo. It has rich black fruits, dark plums and berries, with spice and vanilla flavors. The acidity, with its final lift, gives the wine a fresh aftertaste.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",50950
"94433","This dishes out out generous servings of ripe berry fruit and smoked hickory sauce. It's chewy, richly concentrated and slightly sweet, with lively endnotes of jammy fruit and maraschino.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",94433
"104698","The nose is mildly pickled, most likely a result of American oak barrels, but overall the wine is pretty and easygoing. The flavors of sugar beet and plum skin are good, and the tannic body ensures that it's not a lightweight eager to be knocked out in the early rounds. Best Buy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",104698
"75568","Deep gold color. Quite evolved aromas of citrus marmalade, truffles and a strong earthy minerality. full-bodied with broad, earthy flavors, ripe tropical fruit and hints of honey. Rich, quite viscous texture that lacks a little acidity. Moderately long, warm finish with a hint of sweetness.","White","Riesling","France",75568
"15661","Chopped herb, underbrush, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The palate is fresh, vibrant and polished, offering sour cherry fruit with a hint of licorice. A sage note closes the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",15661
"52120","Faiveley owns two acres of this large Grand Cru vineyard. This 2011 is a big, bold and fruity wine that shows red fruits, a sweet texture and good acidity. It's powerful and dark, jammy as well as structured. The wood flavors are still showing strongly and need to soften. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",52120
"87591","Crushed mint, red berry and menthol aromas mix with an unusual scent suggesting paraffin. The aromas carry over to the straightforward linear palate together with sour cherry, thyme and clove alongside. Firm tannins and fresh acidity provide support.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",87591
"26100","Somewhat simple and fruity-sweet, this is a silky, crisp wine, plump with jammy cherry, raspberry, root beer and smoky vanilla flavors. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26100
"60413","Crisp green apple meets rounded yellow pear on the nose of this 100% Chardonnay sparkler. Weighty and round on the palate, fine bubbles lift up the flavors of lemon pastry and apple blossom, finishing clean and lightly toasty.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",60413
"94469","A whiff of roasted nuts adds a rustic character to ripe black fruit on this Merlot. It's big and bold on the palate with concentrated fruit framed rigidly with tannins and acidity, but a hint of leafy, herbaceous notes adds elegance.","Red","Merlot","US",94469
"71099","This austere wine offers some firm tannins over the red fruit. It has acidity, red-currant fruit and a core of dryness, typical of young Pommard, that suggests it will age well. Drink from 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",71099
"64105","Made in the familiar style that is K-J Vintner's Reserve, this Chardonnay shows pineapple, lemondrop, mineral and spice flavors balanced with crisp coastal acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",64105
"44975","This stainless steel-aged wine shows confected, marshmallow-like notes before its high-toned, stony minerality comes through. Peach and citrus flavors form the fruit foundation, which is creamy in texture.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",44975
"16067","Grown in the Oakley area from (mostly) old vines, this Zin is dry, lush in texture and complex in flavors. It has lovely floral and mineral notes to the spicy raspberries, cherries, currants and cola. Great job at a good price.","Red","Zinfandel","US",16067
"50025","Aromas of tobacco, vanilla and licorice are nicely intermixed with black fruit scents. The palate on this blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère is hard driving and focused. Flavors of plum, currant and spice hold steady across a tannic, mildly abrasive finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",50025
"35770","The 2007 vintage was generally a great one for Bordeaux-style reds in Stellenbosch, and the Els Signature definitely demonstrates it. Sure, it's ripe and sexy with a lot of sweet oak characteristics like cocoa powder and smoky wood, but it's got the ripe fruit core of black plum and dark forest berries to back it up. Spicy layers of leather, cigar box and black tea leaves add complexity to the palate, while chewy tannins provide a firm structure. A bit young now, so try after 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","South Africa",35770
"84758","Lots to like in this smooth, polished Chardonnay. It shows plenty of ripe pineapple, peach and pear flavors, with overtones of vanilla and buttered toast. Good price for the quality.","White","Chardonnay","US",84758
"21971","The most gentle strawberry fruit appears unobtrusively on the nose. The palate reveals incredibly pure and honest wild strawberry fruit. The palate is slender but totally concentrated—there is depth to the wine and something ethereal and utterly seductive. This is not about power but about arresting allure. The true nature of Pinot Noir has been captured here, without force, without guile. This is honest and all the more disarming for that.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",21971
"74665","Sourced entirely from the Bacchus vineyard, this was whole-cluster pressed and 20% was fermented in neutral oak. Just a hint of sweetness remains, but what comes across strongly is a mineral-driven, wet stone base, under snappy fruit flavors of citrus, apple and orange peel.","White","Riesling","US",74665
"3028","Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",3028
"19493","Punchy prickly citrus aromas are clearly that of Sauvignon Blanc. Light in color and weight, this tastes of tangy citrus with a shot of black and green pepper. Lime is the key flavor noted on a clean but mild finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",19493
"25995","Pretty good price for a Cab of this richness and balance. Offers dry, forward flavors of blackberries, cocoa, anise, spice and cedar, with an olivaceous streak. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25995
"32895","A little soft, but delicious and complex. It has waves of raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, red licorice and oaky cedar flavors, with a spicy edge of smoked meat, like cured salumi. Feels elegant, although it lacks the structure for aging, so drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",32895
"5896","Fermented in neutral oak barrels, this tasty wine is loaded with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with excellent concentration and length.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5896

"97343","With its pungent scents of cracked pepper and potent berry aromas, this is not a shy Shiraz. On the palate, it delivers an intriguing blend of vanilla and berries, marked by more sauvage elements of peppercorn and grilled beef, all wrapped in a sturdy, well built package of ample weight, adequate acidity and dusty tannins. Drink now–2020. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",97343
"87667","Gold in color, this is a wood-aged Port. Despite being 26 years old, it is still lively, almost fruity. The wood character does certainly show strongly, but so do the delicious caramel and toffee flavors, which are balanced by an intense acidity. Like all Colheitas, it is ready to drink.","Port","Port","Portugal",87667
"22527","Beautifully balanced, this opens with alluring scents of wild berry, rose, baking spice and whiffs of chopped herb. Seamlessly combining ripe fruit and the firm's trademark finesse, the bright elegantly structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and a hint of black tea framed in polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's already tempting but the best is yet to come. Drink 2021–2031.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",22527
"81966","Dry and overly crisp throughout, this is light and peppery smelling, with notes of oregano and tomato leaf. It feels astringent and dry, with peppery, earthy flavors.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",81966
"33142","Some reduction still swings on the nose in the form of flinty smokiness, once this wears off, pure, taut, zesty lemon comes to the fore and remains the central feature of this streamlined, slender wine. There is midpalate texture and whistle-clean length.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",33142
"90861","This inexpensive wine is relatively low in alcohol and reasonably refreshing, although pear, melon and pineapple flavors leave a slightly sweet impression on the palate. Drink now.","White","Pinot Grigio","Australia",90861
"78820","For Argentina, this is about as fresh and clean as Chardonnay gets. The nose is pure but basic, with mineral and apple aromas. The palate feels good and correct, while flavors of banana, apple, melon and vanilla are solid but not overly powerful.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",78820
"5573","The nose on this wine is condensed and tight, with snappy berry aromas that come across fresh. The palate feel is lively and juicy, while flavors of plum, berry and tobacco are honest and appealing. Straightforward and convincing as a whole, with a solid structure. Drink now through 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",5573
"64707","Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",64707
"20884","With time, initial smoky and rubbery aromas become more savory and fruity on the palate. This wine has ripe red- and black-cherry flavors, a crisp balance and a smooth texture that's low in tannin.","Red","Merlot","US",20884
"104738","This offers a distinctive take on Boushey fruit, with a lot of green tea in the tannins. The berry flavors take a back seat to the vineyard's distinctive highlights of earth, cured meat, and Rhône-like bacon fat.","Red","Syrah","US",104738
"87360","This wine varies in quality and perception based on when in its lifespan you taste it. Now, toward the end of the line, it's tropical and hanging in there, with green apple, citrus and other typical SB aromas and flavors. Even with 15% Carmenère in the blend for kicks, it's standard and workmanlike.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",87360
"9792","Dark-skinned berry, menthol toast and tilled soil aromas come together in the glass. Full-bodied, ripe, velvety tannins underscore flavors of mature black cherry, licorice, tobacco and clove. Drink 2018–2028.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",9792
"97810","Like the winery's other newly released Zinfandels, this one is excessively soft, missing some structure to provide balance to the extraordinarily rich berry, cherry, bacon, cola and spice flavors. Still, it earns points for sheer deliciousness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",97810
"103752","Inviting layered aromas of ripe stone fruit, hints of citrus and some earthy spice and minerality. Crisp and refreshing. Very good depth and intensity of lively youthful fruit with a strong mineral core adding complexity. Medium sweet and balanced with a long finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",103752
"105968","This wine from the historic vineyard is light in color but not shy on the nose at all: lime blossoms, lemon curds, honeysuckle and lemon-lime soda all leap from the glass. The palate combines chopped dill and dewy herbs with green fruits, from pears to kiwi to lime peels, all presented with a lot of briskness.","White","Chardonnay","US",105968
"61351","Blue flower, ripe plum, vanilla, underbrush and leather aromas waft out of the glass. The palate delivers black cherry, coffee, toast, black pepper and clove alongside tightly-knit tannins. Drink 2015–2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",61351
"105796","Made from a blend of grapes from the estate's top vineyards, this vivacious dry Riesling balances crisp mineral tones against ripe, tropical notes of mango, pineapple and melon. It's lusciously mouthcoating yet cut with strikes of tangerine and lime. Delightful now, but structured enough to improve through at least 2023.","White","Riesling","US",105796
"40946","This reserve wine is a four grape, Bordeaux-style blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon holding the principal spot. The flavors are diffuse, lightly herbal and peppery, with little concentration or definition.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",40946
"74089","Picture-perfect Dry Creek Valley Zin. So lush, so delicious, you just can't get enough. Power-packed with cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, tobacco, oak and spice flavors, the wine's structure is beautiful, with elegant tannins and brisk acids.","Red","Zinfandel","US",74089
"10294","A blend of grapes from Washington and Oregon, this includes 25% Semillon also. As you might suspect, it's an unusual wine, opening soft and spicy, with a lightly honeyed character. Fruit flavors emphasize lemon curd and key lime, and there's a refreshing ginger ale flavor running through the fruit core.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",10294
"10419","An attractively fruity wine that's easy to drink and fresh. Lemon and apples give a crisp edge, followed by a zesty, fragrant character. Drink this light wine now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",10419
"14955","Neutral French oak played a part in this wine's fermentation, giving it weight and substance without distraction. Exotic on the nose, it's fleshy and high toned in guava and lemon zest, with a memorable length of mineral-like stone that gives it texture and complexity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",14955
"87931","Although the bouquet is a bit scratchy, bright, lightly candied aromas of raspberry and strawberry jam are friendly and welcoming. The wine is firm on the palate and well built, with fresh, slightly jammy tasting plum and berry flavors. And it's lasting and fresh on the finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",87931
"15146","Cherry and leather aromas show a stemmy, brambly element. The mouthfeel is sharp and scratchy, while the flavors are a mix of reedy tobacco, raspberry and cherry. Choppy but juicy and lively on the finish. A blend of Mazuelo, Syrah and Garnacha.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",15146
"45495","The aromas of orange and mineral are uncomplicated and friendly. It feels pure and offers good flow, with apple, lime, mineral, white pepper and anise flavors. Fruity, dry and composed on the finish, this is great wine for patio sipping or pairing with seafood.","White","White Blend","Spain",45495
"79962","Aromas of pressed spring flower, peach blossom and yellow stone fruit take center stage. The dense full-bodied palate offers ripe yellow plum, dried apricot and rosemary honey.","White","Garganega","Italy",79962
"98122","Intense, direct aromas of blackberry, cassis and graphite are bold but not overly complex. This is so large and extracted on the palate that the tannins grind. Ripe blackberry, cassis and a hint of salt fill the flavor profile, while this finishes fat, tannic and with flavors of licorice and blackberry. Drink through 2026.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",98122
"70168","Richly smooth, this is a beautifully generous wine that brings out the perfumed nature of the Syrah. Ripe with black fruits, it is still packed with dark tannins and dense concentrated fruit. Drink this powerful wine from 2018.","Red","Syrah","Portugal",70168
"80404","Soléna really ups their PG game with this latest vintage, a super rich, succulent effort that is packed to the core with fresh pear fruit flavors. Light touches of cinnamon, and a sense of sweetness from ripe fruit, not residual sugar, keep the flavors expanding through a lush and creamy finish.","White","Pinot Gris","US",80404
"98016","Shows plenty of finesse in the dry, minerally profile, and the crisp acidity that makes the finish clean and savory. Could be a bit richer, but the pineapple and lemon candy flavors satisfy.","White","Chardonnay","US",98016
"94797","At a full 91% of the blend, this could be labeled as Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc rounding it out. It's shut down aromatically at present with assorted dried herbs poking through. The palate brings highly structured fruit flavors, with vibrant acidity tying it all together. Decant for a day if drinking in the near term; it will be best after 2022.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",94797
"62489","Earthy aromas of light herbs, tobacco and cherry announce a round, jammy palate that's more lush and easy than tight and structured. This Syrah-based blend includes Garnacha and Monastrell, and it tastes of blackberry, baked plum and herbs. The finish is a bit wide and soft, so drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",62489
"1638","For a Morgon, this is relatively light, showing more fruit than structure, with freshness that's tempered by a firm edge and minerality. Keep for a year, or drink now.","Red","Gamay","France",1638
"80656","This 100% Syrah rosé is extremely pale in color and offers dainty aromas of pink peony, cherry, strawberry hull and barely ripe peach. The pristine palate offers more of the same, with additional hints of melon rind and peach skin that lend some bitterness and texture to the finish. Well balanced and refreshing; drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",80656
"92193","A barrel-selection from multiple vineyard sources, this offers black cherry fruit highlighted by root beer and black licorice. Aging nine months in 25% new barrels adds pleasant toastiness to the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92193
"41647","Dark in color, this wine has an oaky and earthy nose, with a compost streak. It feels full and stocky, and it tastes of resiny oak and dry berry fruits. It finishes with a citrus-like juiciness.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",41647
"48588","This structured ripasso has intense aromas of prune, raisin and graphite. The round and velvety palate offers a ripe blackberry core, spiced by accents of chocolate, mint, tobacco and bitter almond. Pair this with seasoned cheeses or spicy red-meat dishes.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",48588
"37543","This is a perfumed wine with fine acidity. The tannins are soft, accompanied by black cherry and ripe berry notes, making this a sweet, rich style. The Quinta Senhora de Ribeira is on the north bank of the Douro, facing Quinta do Vesúvio on the south bank.","Port","Port","Portugal",37543
"46169","Tastes soft and a little tired at the age of six-plus years, with pie-filling raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. A certain dry complexity makes it interesting, but its lifespan is largely exhausted.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",46169
"23268","A direct-pressed wine, this has a pretty copper-pink color. It is intense in cranberry and subtle herbes de Provence, with notions of fresh-cut grass and tart Meyer lemon. Young, it needs time in the glass to reveal its complexity and range of flavor. The finish is dry and succulent on the palate.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",23268
"32373","Corvina, along with smaller percentages of Rondinella and Molinara, is the base for this meaty expression of Ripasso. Aromas here include raw cherry, blackberry tart, dark vanilla bean and barbecue spice.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",32373
"31624","This wine is a blend of international and indigenous Hungarian varieties, made from 60% Furmint, 17% Hárslevelu, 11% Chardonnay, 9% Sauvignon Blanc and 3% Muscat. A bouquet of creamsicle and lychee set the stage for flavors of tropical fruits and orange zest. It is sinewy on the palate, with a surprisingly velvety finish.","White","White Blend","Hungary",31624
"58643","This vintage no-dosage Cava is naturally smoky smelling and crisp as a whistle, with apple aromas. It feels entirely fresh and full of energy, with lemon, underripe pineapple and apple flavors. The finish is pure, and as you'd expect from a top-notch brut nature, minerally and elegant.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",58643
"32644","This budget-priced Syrah offers hints of why the grape does so well in Washington. It has a bit of peppery bite, some very tart cranberry fruit, crisp acids and a lifted, citrusy finish. Clean and varietal, it's a good everyday effort.","Red","Syrah","US",32644
"88126","Dark, luxurious streaks of blackberry and cherry lend heft and silkiness to this full-bodied Merlot. Subtly spiced, it's accented by sprightly acidity and fine, feathery tannins in the midpalate.","Red","Merlot","US",88126
"101612","For a red wine from the Vinho Verde region, this is impressive. Serious wood aging hasn't dampened the red fruits and firm tannins. The wine is dry, solid and with final acidity. It should be drunk now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",101612
"34775","For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",34775
"6020","Pear-scented, this supple white delivers straight down the line without any annoying frills. The wine is balanced, clean and comes with poised acidity.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",6020

"94571","This fruity wine has a refreshing citrus flavor. Lightly textured, it is lively and crisp. A mineral edge gives it tight structure, putting the wine into the food category.","Rosé","Rosé","France",94571
"58236","Minty, leathery berry fruit aromas are herbal and foresty. This is flush and solid in feel, with controlled tannins. Roasted, herbal black plum and berry flavors are what you'd expect from Colchagua Valley Carmenère, while this feels meaty and tastes blackened on the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",58236
"96105","A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish. This is very young, compact, and still tight as a drum; it could be cellared for up to a decade.","White","Riesling","US",96105
"28302","Wood-aged wine, very rich and opulent. It has great layers of spice, guava, sweet nectarine, along with a light citrus touch. It feels high in alcohol, which is a shame.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",28302
"101722","This is a seriously dry wine, somewhere between stony and chalky in terms of texture. Aromatically, it strikes a balance between herb and citrus, finishing long and crisp.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",101722
"99074","The nose gives away very little. The palate has exquisite lightness, with a fine spray of tender spritz that accentuates the slight white-pepper notes. Lemon and green pear shimmer through. This is light but refreshing, with a clean, spicy lemon finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",99074
"12591","Acids and tannins dominate, at the expense of fruit, giving this Pinot Noir a hard, rustic feel. The cherry flavors aren't strong enough to bust through the dryness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12591
"89053","A bright, candy pink colored blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah, this has plenty of acidity although its weight and ripe fruit give the wine a heavy feel. It is ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",89053
"37622","The nose opens with black-skinned berry, underbrush and toast aromas. It's firm and fruity on the palate, with black cherry, white pepper and mocha flavors framed by polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",37622
"81757","Righteous is a new budget label for Sweet Valley Winery. Mostly Merlot, this smooth, fruity red wine is ready to drink. It tastes like a latter-day version of the Hearty Burgundies of old, only with better fruit, and a hint of hazelnut in the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",81757
"22318","The nose of this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas is simultaneously delicate and voluptuous, with strawberry, plump plum, crushed slate and pepper seasonings. The palate is focused, with fresh red fruit, a rocky structure and strong thyme, marjoram and sage characteristics. Soft and delicious, it finishes with a dried strawberry kick.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",22318
"50406","Attractively fruity, this is a crisp, citrus and green plum flavored wine. The tight texture gives a fresh character that also has some minerality. Lively and bright at the end.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",50406
"76390","This blend of equal parts Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, vanilla and chocolate. The palate offers sweet plum, black cherry, bell pepper and mint in a one dimensional, friendly style.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",76390
"11532","Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",11532
"78613","Honey, peach and pear aromas open the nose on this fresh Vermentino. A touch of vanilla cream gives the finish a full, generous feel.","White","Vermentino","Italy",78613
"27440","Olive and leather aromas ride over herbal berry tones. This is fresh and medium in body, with salty, charred blackberry flavors. Salt and pepper flavors monopolize the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",27440
"25414","The aromas on this wine are surprisingly blue fruited for a Cabernet, followed by notes of herb, green pepper and spice. The flavors are lightly sweet, followed by a spice-filled finish. It's a straightforward quaffer that doesn't quite show its variety.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25414
"85444","Crisp up front, but not overly aromatic or fruity. Feels kind of thick and chewy, with gummy, sweet berry flavors that suggest cherry and plum. Feels a little cloying and cooked on the finish, especially for a young 2011.","Rosé","Rosé","Argentina",85444
"86239","This straightforward red opens with aromas of leather, game and black-skinned fruit. The firm palate delivers prune, cedar and tobacco alongside assertive tannins that leave a rather grippy finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",86239
"96952","A classic northern Rhône valley blend of Syrah with a touch of Viognier, this massive wine is made from grapes grown on granite soil, which leaves its mark in dense minerality and great power. It is a wine for lovers of the big stuff, concentrated and needing to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","Portugal",96952

"93611","Red currant and dried-herb aromas lead into sweet cranberry and cherry flavors. It goes down easy.","Red","Merlot","US",93611
"102731","Vibrant, complex aromas of grilled asparagus, ember, tapenade, fresh herb, potpourri and moist earth lead to full abundant palate-coating fruit and savory flavors. It shows a very pretty sense of styling along with impeccable balance.","Red","Syrah","US",102731
"11631","Big, yet creamy in texture and refined, with plenty of silky tannins to frame the superripe black cherry fruit. Just lacks a little complexity, but still a very good, juicy mouthful of fruit and oak. Drink now–2013.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",11631
"60554","This decent-quality wine is smoky in aroma, a bit earthy and cherrylike in flavor and medium in body. There's a touch of tannin to add some grip in the texture.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60554

"51603","Big-boned and intense, it features oaky, thick, ripe dark cherry as the main standout, although it is nearly overwhelmed by earth and vanilla.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51603
"103189","Made entirely with Sangiovese and without any added chemical sulfites, this wine leads off with earthy aromas of wet soil, leather, fragrant blue flower and red berries. The one-dimensional palate opens with sour cherry accented with a hint of cinnamon-spice alongside chewy but fleeting tannins. It's a bit diluted and finishes abruptly.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",103189
"2382","Shows Petite Sirah's tremendous power, with full-bodied blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and pepper flavors, and there's a wonderful meatiness suggesting charred beef fat. The alcohol is high, yet the wine is measured, with firm, ripe tannins. Really a fine expression of Petite Sirah, Paso-style.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",2382
"104697","A pale shadow of richer Russian River Pinot, but with plenty of flavor and appellation character. Sort of an introductory  Pinot, with pretty cola and cherry flavors and silky tannins. Snaps to a quick finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104697
"105568","This taut, medium-bodied wine displays ample complexity on the nose in the form of mossy, mushroomy notes and red cherries. Those cherries are bright and crisp on the palate, then pick up touches of caramel or brown sugar on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",105568
"106111","Reserved aromas of cherry, chocolate, thistle, moist earth and dark berry lead to red and black fruit flavors that are sumptuous, rich and layered. It brings immediate appeal but also offers plenty of cellaring potential—a complete delight that appeals on multiple levels.","Red","Syrah","US",106111
"38869","A spectacular Syrah, distinctly Californian in the ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, with rich, firm tannins and a finish of spice. The tannins really mark this wine, so creamy and smooth, making the mouthfeel a delight. Drink now–2014 for youthful exuberance.","Red","Syrah","US",38869
"96345","A very zinny Zin, packed with the variety's briary blackberry, anise, dark chocolate, bacon and crushed black-pepper flavors. It's the winery's best Zinfandel since the 2006 vintage.","Red","Zinfandel","US",96345
"92630","Intense aromas of tropical lychee and honeydew waft from this concentrated, off-dry Gewürztraminer. The palate is lush and unabashedly forward in fruit, but elegantly balanced by tangerine acidity.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",92630
"50695","A good Chardonnay, if a little unbalanced, showing some green, minty notes to the citrus and oak. Despite the rich creaminess, feels somewhat unripe. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",50695
"91528","Substantial and muscular, still quite tight and unyielding, this grudgingly displays purple fruits in a mix of roasted coffee beans, clove and black olive. If past releases are any indication, this will continue to evolve and expand as it gets a bit more bottle time.","Red","Syrah","US",91528
"41235","Full-bodied, creamy in texture and richly fruited, this is a fine example of Gigondas. Garrigue and black cherries mark the nose, picking up hints of chocolate on the long, silky finish. Drink now–2025.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",41235
"15778","Clean, dry and spicy, this full-bodied wine has earthy flavors of cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon and sweet tobacco. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",15778
"18102","A clean aspect shines through this wine that offers all the freshness of green and yellow citrus along with a herbal glint, perhaps of citrus foliage. This is concentrated and comes with disarming purity and freshness that's wonderfully precise and dry.","White","Riesling","France",18102
"18711","This Roero offers very good intensity of aromas that are characterized by layers of white cherry, wild berry and exotic spice. The wine offers a soft, velvety feel in the mouth although those tight tannins definitely appear on the close.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",18711
"48150","Candied, jammy raspberry, cherry and white chocolate flavors mark this simple blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft in tannins and acidity, it's easy to drink with burgers, lasagna, or for something different, figs and gorgonzola cheese.","Red","Red Blend","US",48150
"49616","This is a subtle and intriguing bottle, crafted from a range of sources, offered in significant quantities (16,300 cases) and showing varietal fruit, spice and a deft touch with the barrels. Not a big wine, but balanced and quite flavorful, with more depth than you expect at this price point. Lots of chocolate and spicy burnt coffee in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49616
"51385","From a multiplicity of vineyards, this wine works and is a tremendous value for the price. It mixes hot mulled-cider spices, cinnamon, clove and pine forest, conveying surprising depth. Plum, dark cherry and more clove lead to a powerful, leathery finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",51385
"30607","This is a small production wine blended by French sommeliers. The result is a soft, rich wine, deliciously ripe and perfumed. There are touches of honey as well as yellow fruits and mango juice. The acidity gives the wine a lift and makes a contrast to the richness of the wine. Drink now.","White","White Blend","France",30607
"98062","A solid Cabernet, offering lots of Napa flash at a decent price, It's dry, full bodied and tannic, with rich black currant, cherry and licorice flavors for drinking now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",98062
"1724","Forward and easy in cherry, currant, raspberry, tangerine zest, cola and peppery spice flavors, this Zin has a gentle texture. There's also a wealth of firm, dusty tannins that could help the wine age for a few years.","Red","Zinfandel","US",1724
"57833","From the Beckstoffer Georges III vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this 100% varietal wine is immense in lushness, plush and alive in cinnamon, red and black berry and smoke. Soft tannins provide a lift and an enjoyable evolution to the finish, with a bite of heft on the last sip. This should cellar well through 2020–2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",57833
"19216","There are very distinctive botanical aromas on this wine, from salted orange peels to juniper bush, almost like a gin. The palate is also incredibly herbal, with dried dill, marjoram and basil, which makes for a very interesting sipper though perhaps a bit odd for some.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",19216
"101182","This light Chablis is fresh and packed with attractive young fruitiness. It comes from the plateau above the Serein valley and shows its provenance in the cool-climate crispness. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",101182
"39741","Opaque black to the eye, this is a massive, high-alcohol, syrupy Garnacha that is more like Port than dry wine. Aromas of prune and raisin dominate, while the palate is thick as molasses, with gummy, raisiny flavors that finish with heady notes of coffee and chocolate syrup. At 16% ABV, and with outlandish weight and stickiness, this isn't what you'd call a food-friendly table wine.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",39741
"54900","This is the first vintage for this wine, made by Syncline's James Mantone. A delectable blend of 48% Mourvèdre, 28% Grenache and 24% Syrah, aged in 100% neutral oak barrels, this is a sappy, concentrated, mouth-pleasing blast of plum, cherry and spice. As it rolls across the palate, the distinct impression is of chocolate-covered cherries.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",54900
"55860","This 100% varietal wine opens with a strong bouquet of black licorice, maybe even fennel, before big, boisterous tannins stomp the stage. Full bodied and exuberant in blackberry and black cherry, the oak is measured. A backbone of structure could stand up to aging.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55860
"52647","This starts out with cranberry and dark cherry flavors, with a hint of blackberry. It has good tannin structure but not much depth. Simple, it's ready to drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52647
"38318","With a small percentage of Merlot for extra softness and plushness, this beautiful Sangiovese-based wine opens with amazing intensity, red cherry, chocolate, spice and leather. The rich, round mouthfeel would pair with creamy porcini mushroom risotto.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",38318
"103929","There's no denying that this is a heavily oaked Rioja with toast, resin, vanilla and cheesy aromas alongside fully ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's energy to the palate, while previously mentioned heavy oak spawns flavors of vanilla and spice to go with berry fruit. A mouth-coating, woody finish stands out on this compartmentalized Tempranillo-led blend. Drink through 2023.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",103929
"61029","From near the Tuscan coast comes this Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's a little rusty in color, with aromas of molasses and plums. The balance is classic, and there's a hint of Médoc earthiness to it, maybe from the Cab Franc. With softer tannins than many, it's already drinkable.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Italy",61029
"102222","Pineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether.","White","Verdejo","Spain",102222
"63426","This full-bodied wine combines spicy aromas with deep fruit flavors like plum and blackberry. The fresh, juicy texture has just enough tannin to make it appetizing. The wine has enough heft to pair well with a lot of savory and meaty dishes.","Red","Zinfandel","US",63426
"49998","This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah from coastal Tuscany opens with bright fruit, a somewhat lean texture and delivers lively berry notes of wild strawberry and white cherry. A good value, the wine would pair well with pizza or pasta.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",49998
"1548","This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",1548
"87745","This Chardonnay is a touch volatile on the nose, which deals some gym sweat and brine. Eventually things break down to dusty, soft white-fruit aromas. Flavors of banana, papaya and white pepper end with tropical notes. This is just good enough.","White","Chardonnay","Mexico",87745
"50877","Lightly gritty, stalky and earthy on the nose, this blend offers additional aromas of wild berry fruits, spice and tomato. A slightly heavy, grabby palate offers roasted, salty blackberry flavors followed by notes of leather and meat on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",50877
"47260","Formigar is a gorgeous and opulent Chardonnay with lavish aromas of mature fruit, apricot, honeysuckle and toasted almond. It's super smooth and creamy in the mouth and those cool-climate, passion fruit flavors really pop on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",47260
"6604","This Pinot is dry, silky and light-bodied. It shows pleasant raspberry, cola and red currant flavors that finish clean and racy, and the alcohol level is a refreshingly low 13.5% by volume. It requires no aging, so drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6604
"98473","The nose on this estate wine emerges slowly with enough sniffing, offering white peach, white flowers and honeydew. It's a fruit salad of flavors once sipped, suggesting melons and apples tossed in citrus vinaigrette.","White","Chardonnay","US",98473
"53095","More traditional than modern in style, this has aromas of citrus, herb, dry oak and medium-weight fruit. It feels crisp and tightly focused, with a complex palate that offers notes of berries, chocolate and herbs. It finishes long, with a leathery, meaty element that lends gravitas to the wine. Drink now–2016.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",53095
"85249","The producer continues to up its game with this refined, cool-climate red that doesn't dare skimp on power and flavor. Herby, floral and elusive in waves, it's also voluptuously spicy and totally youthful in its big, dry tannin imprint.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85249
"58712","Talk about a sharp wine; this almost socks you in the nose upon taking a whiff. It's full of citrus and jalapeño aromas, which are backed by sizzling bell pepper, serrano chili and lime flavors. Expect a raw feeling and super crisp finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",58712
"41288","Alluring scents of apple and Alpine wildflower float over to the bright but slender palate along with notes of pear and mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",41288
"91723","Full bodied and complex, this is a fleshy Pinot Noir with fruit flavors that run from mulberry to spicy plum. Streaks of Dr. Pepper and some black pepper add finishing highlights.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91723
"2085","Intense and elegant, it brings together sensations of violet, crushed red berry, mineral and cake spices that are supported by firm but fine tannins and brisk acidity. Fermented with wild yeasts, it illustrates the vibrant character of the vintage. Drink 2018–2040. Acid Inc Selections, Stefano Miretti Imports.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",2085
"58541","This is the least expensive McCrea Syrah, compiled from the same excellent sources as the higher end wines. It's a solid effort, with black fruits threaded with cedar, smoke, licorice and coffee liqueur. It was aged 32 months in 2–6 year old French oak.","Red","Syrah","US",58541
"31339","This is rich and appealing now for its ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste as if they were baked in a sweet, smoky pie crust. The acidity provides a pleasant tartness. It should age well over the next 3–5 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31339
"61163","The texture is smooth and velvety on this Zinfandel, but the flavors are off. You'll find ripe blackberry jam and currants right next to overripe raisins. Enormously high alcohol makes this wine taste like a fruity, simple port.","Red","Zinfandel","US",61163
"79529","Glimpses of sunny yellow peach and apple peek through layers of heady spice, vanilla and toast in this brisk but oaky Chardonnay. It's polished but spry, revitalized by a spray of zesty acidity through the midpalate and finish. Drink now through 2020.","White","Chardonnay","US",79529
"17518","Sweaty and pungent, this is an aggressively aromatic wine with ample intensity. Fresh greens and passion fruit flavors finish dry, even a bit austere, without excessive weight or ripeness. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",17518
"2066","Ripe pear on nose and palate is the central theme on this broad-shouldered and richly textured wine. A dollop of sweetness is countered with fresh lime acidity that concludes in ripe accord.","White","Pinot Gris","France",2066
"33822","This fails to overcome its thin, unripe fruit. Strong scents of smoke and oak carry into the flavors, bringing a bitter end to the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",33822
"14776","The top white wine from Chantegrive, this is a smoothly wood-aged wine. However it doesn't lose sight of deliciously fresh, herbaceous fruits which come through crisply. That makes the resulting balance immediately appealing, acidity and spice coming together well. Worth aging for 2–3 years.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",14776
"6914","This is a light, clear and straightforward wine, reduced somewhat on the nose, and exhibiting a tight, tannic structure and backbone of oak. Black cherry and blackberry dominate in flavor, with a full-bodied feel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6914
"62785","Earthy aromas include forest floor, black berries, leather and spice. The palate is less expressive and has a green character, showing unripe red cherry alongside astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, bitter close.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",62785
"60177","A pure startling cherry note rises from the glass. It is flanked by notes of autumn forest, tar and dried orange rind. Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones. The body is svelte and fresh: its fine-boned structure is as much down to fresh acidity as it is to finely flexed tannins. This is profound, lasting and delicious but also deliciously light.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",60177
"51936","Dijon and Pommard clones blend gracefully here, pushing sweet cherry fruit and baking spices into the flavor center. A touch of fresh-baked pie crust lingers also, and this easy-drinking cuvée should be enjoyed now through 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51936
"1784","Pretty and floral, juicy and substantial, this wine delivers in flavor and texture, conveying caramel, baked pear and pineapple. Notable oak wraps around the fruit, ending with hazelnut and nutmeg.","White","Chardonnay","US",1784
"6066","This is a sophisticated blend of Carignano, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and it's always delightful. This vintage shows intense, soft notes of dried sage and rosemary.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",6066
"2390","A super-rich wine, almost over the top in its honeyed intensity. It is opulent, generous, packed with ripe yellow fruits, mango and pineapple. The wine is so rich that it is hard to find the acidity, but it is there in the orange marmalade flavor right at the end.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",2390
"4962","A burly surprise from southern Oregon; there are flowery, almost honeyed elements to the black-fruit nose. It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day. But stand clear of this hefster if you prefer elegant, streamlined Pinot Noir.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4962
"64207","Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate. Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64207
"11881","Aromas of lees, apricot, vanilla and wheat lead to full-bodied fruit and cinnamon flavors. It's fleshy in feel but the flavor concentration isn't all there.","White","Viognier","US",11881
"105268","There is an unusually high (40%) proportion of Sémillon in the blend, which offers the possibility of aging. Although this wine is fresh, lemony and tightly herbaceous now, it will become more rich and the flavors will deepen. Drink from the end of 2016.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",105268
"102785","A straw-colored wine, this was aged in wood and is full of spice as well as fruit. Centered on Antão Vaz and Verdelho, it has acidity, apricot and citrus flavors and good acidity. Beautifully structured, it's rich while still firm and restrained. Drink from 2018.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",102785
"13350","There's a lightness to this 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot that surprises, making for a friendly, approachable entry. Cassis, raspberry and cedar mix around rounded tannins and a medium-length finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",13350
"50622","This is a simple, tart red, crisp in cranberry and red currant fruit and perfumed with spicy oak. Despite the high acidity on the front palate, it hangs heavy in full-bodied ripeness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",50622
"12295","This is a complex, muscular wine, with good aging potential. The nose carries a whiff of animal (in a good way) and the black fruits are buoyed with generous acidity. Drink 2020–2028.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12295
"19754","Soft and sensual in the mouth, this offers rich, complex layers of cherries, red plums, mocha and cedar. So gentle and luscious, you can drink it now, despite the tannins.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",19754
"73328","Lots of oaky richness in this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has high acidity and a dusty minerality, but also a thick coat of sweet, butterscotchy oak and powerful flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. Drink over the next four years.","White","Chardonnay","US",73328
"54941","This is a 50-50 blend of estate-grown Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. Dark, plush, well-ripened fruit is the focus of a wine still a bit stiff and steely. It's classic in the way a Bordeaux is classic, firm and confidently blended.","Red","Red Blend","US",54941
"18030","Grown on the shelf above the Tagus (Tejo) River, the wine is soft and ripe. It does have tannins that are well integrated into the spicy red fruits and dry core. The wine is rich, and the alcohol is noticeable in the pepper aftertaste. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",18030
"7274","This is a full-bodied wine, from one of the leading estates in Margaux. It is ripe with juicy blackberry and black-currant fruits. This fruit contrasts with the dark tannins and powerful structure. It is going to develop slowly and impressively to be ready to drink from 2025.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",7274
"79818","Fresh strawberry flavors, followed by some vanilla and sweet acidity characterize this wine from the Lagrezette winery. With its blend of Malbec, Syrah and white Viognier, this has softness, ripeness and, despite its acidity, a definite sweet finish.","Red","Malbec","France",79818
"93728","This is a rounded, ripe and fruity wine named after a red star in the Cetus constellation. It is immediately drinkable with attractive red-currant fruit flavors along with perfumed acidity and just a touch of orange zest. The wine is refreshing and very ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",93728
"26494","Still dry, the wine is structured with dense tannins and a concentrated structure. That means that it needs time to develop and allow the fruit to speak. Give it until 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26494
"26202","Thickly concentrated, this wine offers a wealth of crème brûléee richness and complexity, dotted in golden honey and a twist of lime. Supple and medium in build, it integrates the oak and ripeness at its core, finishing with a brightness of acidity that refreshes.","White","Chardonnay","US",26202
"100190","A tasty blend of ripe fruit and baking spice aromas and flavors ride on a smooth texture in this medium-bodied, well-balanced and well-rounded wine. Subtle spiciness glides through the finish of this bottling, which should please most anyone.","White","Chardonnay","US",100190
"39074","Aromas recalling toasted walnut, underbrush and bread crust make themselves known. The vibrant, rather lean palate offers yellow apple, pear and lime alongside small, persistent bubbles and zest acidity. Bitter almond closes the finish.","White","Glera","Italy",39074
"21032","Aromas of espresso, tar, oak extract, grilled red pepper and spiced plum lead the nose. The extracted palate offers dried black cherry, anisette and graphite alongside astringent tannins and the evident warmth of alcohol.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",21032
"105494","Like many 2005s from the northern Rhone, Colombo's Les Ruchets needs time. The tannins dominate the mouth right now, but the black olive and peppered-meat nuances win out in the end, adding depth to tarry, leathery notes and plummy fruit. Try after 2015.","Red","Syrah","France",105494
"76796","Spicy plum and cherry pie aromas offer a note of vanilla before falling off. In the mouth, this is wiry and drawing, with citric acids pushing raspberry and herbal plum flavors toward rawness. The finish is snappy on the surface but hollow beyond that.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",76796
"4387","Bright, vivid and sizzling on the nose, then zesty, tight and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned plum, berry and red currant flavors offset by a touch of milk chocolate. Long on the finish, but not that nuanced or complex.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",4387
"92932","A tight note of spearmint defines the nose. The palate follows suit: It's pinched and hard, with outsized acidity leading to a lemony palate, with searing cherry and red plum flavors. It doesn't waiver on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",92932
"37537","This is a perfumed wine, and its new wood and violet aromas create equally pleasant flavors. The surface-level brilliance is followed by rich, dark tannins and a blackberry note.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",37537
"5447","This is a big, robust, country-style Zin, that's power packed with fruit. The blackberry, blueberry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors go to your head fast, like Port. Bring your designated driver and enjoy with grilled beef.","Red","Zinfandel","US",5447
"72759","Fairly full-bodied and lush, with berry fruit flavors balanced by darker notes of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible.","Red","Zinfandel","Australia",72759
"78520","Fruit from the Momtazi vineyard often has a strong herbal component, here matched to a tart cranberry base. This wine is young, tight, and slightly bitter in the finish, with a hint of pineapple in the acidity. Overall the winemaker's elegant hand lightens up the aggressive herbaceousness, but a bit more fruit would be welcome.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78520
"56351","Accented by tones of forest floor and spice, there's a distinctly Old World tone to this bold red wine. A traditional Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's concentrated with sweet-tart black cherry and plum, but also swathed in slightly vegetal layers of herbs and leaves. Drink now through 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",56351
"20822","A light orange-colored rosé, it's equally light on the palate. It has lost its freshness while broadening out into a softly fruity, orange peel and strawberry flavored wine. It needs food.","Rosé","Rosé","France",20822
"52575","A bit muddled aromatically at first, give this wine a few minutes in the glass to find its voice. Once it does, it delivers an easy, straightforward rendition of cherry, blueberry and toasted almond.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",52575
"6746","Soft and perfumed, the flavors are elegant but intense at the same time. The acidity gives a great freshness to what is in fact a rich wine, the apple and pear flavors going deep down to the steely core. It would be worth aging this wine—maybe 3–5 years.","White","Riesling","Austria",6746
"89517","Another of the producer's estate-grown offerings, this vineyard-designate is bittersweet on the palate, rich and yet softly smooth in anise and waxy apple. Plenty of acidity buoys the experience, adding to the wine's ability to stay crisply refreshing on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",89517
"79530","The aromas explore this variety's savory side, with notes of green herbs and dill followed by vanilla, char, burnt coffee and green wood. The palate shows flavors of char and game, with the tannins seeming gritty.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",79530
"46092","Aged for two years in traditional oak casks, this is bright, slightly gritty and textured on the finish, offering notes of ripe fruit, leather, cured meat and tobacco. Pair this with wild turkey or succulent ham.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",46092
"83116","Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, this blend seems to detract from the purity of both. The result is interesting and even dramatic in ripeness, but a little muddied, with hard tannins making it tough despite a rich center of blackberry and cherry jam.","Red","Red Blend","US",83116
"47089","Brûléed pastry crust and salted butter aromas overlay golden apple and spiced pear tones. The palate feels lax with curved acids, which lead to a light, yielding finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",47089
"91820","With big, ripe fruits, this powerful wine oozes rich plum and spice flavors. It is dark and intense, concentrated with both acidity and wood aging. A line of freshness gives this dense wine an impressive lift of raspberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2021.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",91820
"31777","Tart and fruity, with young fruit flavors of spiced cranberry and sappy raspberry, this may be a touch too sour for some palates. But if acid is what you like, and you want a Pinot with some snap and verve, this will suit you just fine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31777
"33296","Black pepper, graphite and reluctant boysenberry notes balance the rubbery funk on the nose of this cool-climate Syrah. It's fairly light on the palate, with just-ripe boysenberry and chopped Italian herbs.","Red","Syrah","US",33296
"6720","Medium to full in weight and opulent in texture, this is a buttery creamy wine that reflects its South Australian origin. Broad and rich, it's a throwback to a previous generation's style of Chardonnay.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",6720
"105777","Dark in color, this is a big, juicy, tantalizing wine from a beautifully farmed vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma Coast, a cool region where grapes ripen slowly. The wine, too, takes its time to come around, gradually revealing layers of golden apple tart and honey, with a lurking floral element and gentle ginger spice.","White","Chardonnay","US",105777
"71929","Delicate scents of yellow apple, white spring flower and citrus lead into the tangy palate along with a note of candied tangerine zest. Bright acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",71929
"22677","This very special property in Bolgheri includes one of Italy's most important experimental vineyards. Among the various wines made here, this super Tuscan blend opens with plush berry and spice notes as well as leather, roasted almond and ground clove.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",22677
"6857","This wine is at just the right moment of maturity. It's on the dry side, but with just a touch of rich honey flavor. It is ripe, full in the mouth, finely perfumed and ready to drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",6857
"98564","Dark, alluring aromas of licorice, blackberry and toast share space with earthy, mossy notes on the nose of this full-bodied winner that's showing wall-to-wall weight and tannins. Black plum, cassis and tobacco flavors are a common Rioja trifecta, as are dry, peppery, figgy flavors on the finish. Drink from 2018–2028.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",98564
"73379","With lots of spices and maple syrup notes, this smells and tastes rich, nearly sweet, smooth in texture and medium in body. It should be good with barbecue, because the perceived sweetness can soften spicy, peppery food.","Red","Merlot","US",73379
"4552","Here's a frail red that offers weak sensations of sour cherry and strawberry alongside zesty acidity and fleeting, gritty tannins. It's short and dilute.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",4552
"33997","Jumilla is a red-wine region, but this Sauvignon Blanc is a citrusy example of a tastyquaffable white from the area. Aromas of citrus peel are mildly pyrazinic, while this feels plump and balanced, but with spritz. Core citrus flavors come with a sprinkle of salt.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Spain",33997
"54823","The nose is earthy and savory, with brash mineral and lemon tones, but the palate on this dry Riesling is surprisingly pretty, with dashes of blossoms, tart stone fruits and fresh herbs. It's a bit demure in concentration, but an elegant, refreshing quaffer.","White","Riesling","Germany",54823
"42645","This fresh, tangy wine (69% Sangiovese) smells like spicy oak, red cherries and raspberries and tastes equally bright and fruity. The texture is nicely lean, cleansing the palate with each sip, and it doesn't feel full bodied.","Red","Red Blend","US",42645
"58427","Bracing and tightly wound, this opens with subdued aromas of pressed rose, resin and a whiff of exotic spice. The evolved palate isn't in sync with the nose, offering raisin and a touch of anise as well as aggressive, astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, raspy finish. It's already drying out so drink now.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",58427
"77983","Here's a ripe and generous Tuscan blend with mature notes of black cherry and blackberry backed by thick extraction and extraordinary intensity. This is the kind of wine you'll need to pair with succulent cuts of beef thanks to the firm tannins and delicious richness it imparts in the mouth.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",77983
"25517","The winery once made 30,000 cases of Chardonnay. With this release, it micro-sized that number down to 1,250, focusing on 30 vine rows to make a better wine. Mission accomplished—this medium-bodied wine offers a creamy texture, with concentrated fig and pear flavors around a mineral-laden finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",25517
"44690","This is firm, showing a ripe plum-skin flavor and a severe line of tannin. There's some bitterness along with a good depth of fruit flavor, structure and acidity, all of which suggest aging potential.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",44690
"16883","A deep, deep color, lots of spicy, smoky oak aromas and rich, almost sweet flavors add up to a bold barbecue sauce of a wine. Those who love lots of spice, loads of smooth tannins and very full body will be happy.","Red","Zinfandel","US",16883
"78548","This is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah. Dark and smoky, with dense flavors of berry, cassis, licorice and dark chocolate, it is far more substantial than most red blends in this price range.","Red","Red Blend","US",78548
"105632","This wine is a blend of Mourvèdre (75%), Syrah (15%) and Grenache. Aromas of black pepper, dried herbs, moist earth, mango, papaya and lemon twist are followed by tart, lively yet reserved fruit and savory flavors that show impeccable balance and a lengthy finish. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",105632
"15294","This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape is Cab Franc (11%). The vineyard's characteristic lush black cherry fruit is surrounded by even darker components: earth, balsamic, baking chocolate, and espresso. There's an interesting walnut flavor (from the barrels?) and the fruit threads through to the very end of a long finish, supported by firm acids.","Red","Red Blend","US",15294
"44441","A hugely dense wine, with immense ripe black fruit and dusty tannins. The wine is balanced, rich and structured at the same time. Powered by a dark core, the wine has weight, intensity and a solid long-term future.","Port","Port","Portugal",44441
"50365","Here's an easygoing Pinot Grigio with attractive tones of lemon zest, white flower and crushed stone. The wine is lean and mild in the mouth with enough zest and natural acidity to pair with fried sardines.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",50365
"103776","Very lightly textured, this fruity, fresh wine has a hint of caramel to accent flavors of citrus and red berries. The aftertaste is clean and always packed with fruit. Screwcap.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",103776
"80387","Orange peel and raspberry aromas meet a touch of sourness on the nose of this bottling from Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi, which comes after the label's more successful red and white wines. The palate maintains good acidity and grip, with berry compote and earthy flavors.","Rosé","Rosé","US",80387
"17456","Give credit to Ballentine for sticking by this variety even when it's such a hard sell. It's a good wine, crisp and minerally, with sweet Pinot Grigio-like citrus, vanilla and spice flavors.","White","Chenin Blanc","US",17456
"66160","The nose spells delicacy and the palate proves it: this is a light-footed filigree and yet has a firm, straight backbone of spice and zest. Its midpalate texture slowly grows on you and draws you in with mossy notes of pear and ivy.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",66160
"87298","Despite more than 8 g/L of residual sugar, this comes across as dry in style, with austere notes of crushed stone and lime zest balanced by riper hints of apple and pear. It should drink well over at least the next several years.","White","Riesling","New Zealand",87298
"94733","Too sharp, with a bite of acidity and green tannins, but otherwise a decent introductory wine for learning about Pinot Noir's charms. It's dry and silky, with red cherry flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94733
"84771","Dense and inky on the bouquet, with blueberry as the core fruit aroma and some grass or alfalfa around the edges. Feels blocky and tannic, with sweet, roasted flavors of black fruits that come with a peppery aftertaste. Full on the finish, with coconut and oaky accents.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",84771
"61511","The aromas are quite light and elusive, with notes of berries and crushed flowers. The blue-fruit flavors are considerably more generous and linger on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",61511
"9482","Ripe and spicy, this is an impressive, solid, new wood-dominated wine. The tannins come from high toast as well as the concentrated blackberry juice fruits. That makes it dry, a wine that needs to soften. But it has all the intensity that are the hallmarks of top Douro wines, so try it again in a year.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",9482
"101735","Vanilla, toast and stone-fruit aromas are followed by light, elegantly styled flavors that show persistence. It comes off as a bit faint but what's there is pleasing.","White","Chardonnay","US",101735
"88685","While creamy and voluminous, this full-bodied Chardonnay boasts fresh green plum and apple flavors brightened by sunny lemon acidity. Streaks of vanilla, toast and spice are bold yet well integrated. It finishes moderately long with notes of dried herbs.","White","Chardonnay","US",88685
"26401","A lifted ethereal note of dried hay flowers hits you first. This is followed by generously ripe but very purely drawn fruit: Conference pear, star fruit and white currant. There is concentration on the palate, coupled with a pervasive citric freshness that almost lends this an exotic aspect. You simply want to savor and take another sip. An edge of pleasant bitterness corrals the fruit admirably. The finish is dry, lasting and intriguing.","White","Pinot Gris","France",26401
"18550","A brisk, bright Chardonnay, made in the Testarossa style of ripe fruit and oakiness. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in the sheer power of tangerine, pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, elaborated with vanilla cream and caramelized oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",18550
"2017","There's an earthy intensity to this reserve wine, generous in oak and cedar notes with complicated, concentrated mix of plum, cherry and berry. Nonetheless, the wine intrigues and delights.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2017
"10960","There's good density here. This wine shows plenty of ripe Merlot fruit flavors, jammy, lifted with dried fruits and blackberries. It's a rounded, ripe wine, but shot through with a curious, unbalanced, very dry wood element.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",10960
"50771","This wine is crisp, medium bodied and surprisingly firm for an inexpensive Merlot. Drink this wine over the next year or two for its potent cassis and black cherry fruit. Some rare beef will help show the wine to best effect.","Red","Merlot","New Zealand",50771
"13955","Black cherry aromas are grapy and simple, with spice and forced oak notes chiming in. This feels rugged with firm tannins. Short, spicy black cherry flavors finish with a lasting burn.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",13955
"23398","Briny pithy citrus aromas and a standard-feeling palate tell you this is regular but solidly made. Citrus flavors are largely ripe, while pithy grapefruit notes are found on the finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",23398
"7778","Superripe pineapple, lemonade and apricot flavors, coupled with acidity, give this Viognier a candied sweet-and-sour taste.","White","Viognier","US",7778
"28088","This is a banana and red-cherry-flavored wine, that has a light tannic structure to contrast with the fruitiness. It is ready to drink.","Red","Gamay","France",28088
"60463","This blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Can aiolo and 5% other red grapes opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, crushed blue flowers and a whiff of clove. The easygoing palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside dusty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",60463
"37781","Pale gold highlights illuminate this fresh that is redolent of citrus, pear, green grass, mineral tones and very light butter. It has a creamy, sweet opulence in the mouth backed by zesty crispness on the finish.","White","Garganega","Italy",37781
"40985","Earthy notes and yeasty richness swing along the aromatic lemon bouquet. On the very slight, slender palate these flavors appear linear and leave a feeling of near weightlessness. Savory tones of yeast make themselves felt on the long, gossamer finish.","White","Riesling","France",40985
"83429","While red apple, raspberry and bramble aromas on this rosé are restrained, ruddy, slightly overripe cherry and strawberry flavors build on the palate. Dry and full-bodied in style, it finishes with a touch of exotic spice.","Rosé","Rosé","US",83429
"94666","Off-dry with lemon-drop fruit flavors, a lick of citrus that suggests pear and lime. Though it's a fairly simple, fruit-forward wine, it delivers a concentrated burst of fresh, vivid flavor that's missing from most wines in this price range.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",94666
"90120","Starts out odd and exotic, with blueberry and Middle Eastern spice aromas. Feels condensed and jammy, with full flavors of herbs, boysenberry and plum. Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",90120
"54840","This outstanding vineyard, matching mature vines to biodynamic farming, really shines in 2014. A toasty nose sends up coconut and vanilla notes, leading into a full-bodied full-flavored wine with the structure to age another decade or more. It's the perfect balancing act between immediate accessibility and long-term cellaring potential. Drink now through 2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54840
"80209","This is an upfront and vibrant rosé, showing ample stone fruit and watermelon aromas on the nose. Predominately Merlot, it offers a round and fleshy palate, balanced by a lively vein of lemon. These lead to a juicy peach and jasmine tea finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",80209
"34914","Plum, dark cooking spice and menthol aromas emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast, licorice and espresso alongside assertive, grainy tannins that leave a rather raspy finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",34914
"25396","Raimund Prüm's Blue Slate is developing into a consistent performer, marrying hints of ripe fruit—peach or nectarine and melon—with crisp citrusy notes and an underlying minerality that gives it an almost dry finish. Drink now.","White","Riesling","Germany",25396
"7396","The variety is unmistakable on this wine with its aromas of mortared fresh herbs, flowers, dry chocolate and cherry. The flavors show a mixture of lightness, intensity and richness, along with a captivating sense of texture and acidity.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",7396
"99135","Notes of perfume, white peach and honeydew scent this vivacious off-dry Riesling. It's concentrated, with deep, penetrating flavors of lime and pink grapefruit that flood the palate and linger on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",99135
"62928","Coming from a vineyard named after the patron saint of night watchmen, this wine offers luxurious purple aromas of blackberry-vanilla sauce and dark chocolate. The palate is sticky and singing with coffee, milk chocolate and dried cherries, showing plenty of deep tannins and boisterous acidity that will make this bottling last a while.","Red","Zinfandel","US",62928
"52344","Light in color and body, with a silky texture and cherry, cola, bacon and peppery spice flavors, this Grenache could be easily mistaken for Pinot Noir. It's a very nice wine to drink with a steak, lamb chop or pork loin.","Red","Grenache","US",52344
"34570","Blossom and berry notes are accented by hints of smoked nut in this refreshingly light-bodied wine. Zesty and lithe on the palate, it's an ideal summer-to-fall apéritif or porch sipper. The moderately long finish is marked with a hint of waxy florals.","Rosé","Rosé","US",34570
"69552","Aromas recall toasted oak, espresso, rubber and roasted herb. The palate offers raw red cherry, vanilla, grilled sage and black pepper alongside astringent tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",69552
"43279","The delicate pétillance and soft, lingering mousse of this wine exemplify Sparkling Pointe's house style. Crisp apple, pear and lemon flavors are approachable and fresh but nuanced by shades of cream, nut and pastry. Zesty acidity highlights a brisk, impeccably clean finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",43279
"94186","Zingy lemon-lime flavors pierce the palate of this zesty dry-style Riesling. It's remarkably sheer in mouth feel with a crystalline briskness to the finish. Drink now through 2019.","White","Riesling","Germany",94186
"31797","This estate, belonging to the Compagnet family, is in the northern Médoc. Some firm tannins are contrasted with the attractive acidity and berry fruits to create a warm spicy wine. Almost equal amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot give a balanced wine. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",31797
"90882","This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, sourced from throughout the Napa Valley, including the winery's estate Diamond Mountain vineyard. Bold and lush in cranberry and dark chocolate, it's also robust in black pepper and cedar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90882
"94983","As with so many Provence rosés, this wine is dominated by Grenache. That gives the wine a full and fruity character without any hint of heaviness. Ripe red fruits are contrasted with a zingy texture that leaves the wine so fresh in the mouth.","Rosé","Rosé","France",94983
"56893","The variety quickly announces itself with aromas of dark cherry and dried herbs followed by generous barrel accents. The black-fruit flavors are rich but maintain balance, with a persistence that impresses.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",56893
"78458","Pale straw to the eye, this wine offers a bouquet of lemon with a pleasant whiff of petrol. It is equal parts creamy and bright on the palate, with flavors of Granny Smith apple, apricot and lavender.","White","White Blend","Georgia",78458
"8336","Lightweight and easy in the mouth, with bright, juicy red fruit aromas and flavors spiced up by olive tapenade and fruitcake accents. Clean and balanced with a medium-length finish.","Red","Merlot","Israel",8336
"71710","This is a vinous-smelling wine that recalls the sweet berry aromas you would naturally find in the wine cellar. It's a young wine that still needs to find its legs and that, at this point, delivers overt tones of toasted oak.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",71710
"5883","The winery's most-available Syrah is co-fermented with a splash of Viognier. The fruit is tight and compact, clean with red and black berry flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",5883
"86860","Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it. Drily balanced and elegantly constructed, it brims with rich blackberry and black currant flavors, with a fine coating of spicy oak. Best 2012–2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",86860
"69397","Minerally and intense on the nose, this Riesling remains fresh and strident right through the palate and onto the long finish. Apple and citrus flavors seem to carry a hint of sweetness, but it could just be the ripe fruit coming through rather than residual sugar. Drink now.","White","Riesling","Australia",69397
"32033","This crunchy, tart and tasty blend is 55% Viognier, 30% Marsanne and 15% Roussanne. Highlights of green berry, lemon-lime and grapefruit are refreshing and well matched to lighter pasta dishes or simple poultry entrées.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",32033
"70070","Concentrated, delicious fruit flavors and subtle spiciness make a great combination in this harmonious and full-bodied wine. There is no obvious oak character, but it tastes like a gently barrel-fermented wine that developed hints of cream, nutmeg and honey along with a river of ripe pear and peach.","White","Chardonnay","US",70070
"92682","Principally Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from old vines at the Dionysus vineyard, this includes 12% Cabernet Franc and a splash of Merlot. It's spicy and toasty, with ripe fruit flavors recalling strawberry preserves and cherry pie. Coffee and smoke hints thread throughout and into the finish. It's oaky in the best way and delicious from start to finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",92682
"71060","This bottling is quintessential Red Mountain in style, with potent aromatics of concentrated black fruits, gun metal and rock. Sourced from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, Force Majeure and Klipsun, it's a one-wine showcase for the AVA. The spectrum of fruit flavors is impressive, compact and deep, and despite the high alcohol it retains its precision and detail.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71060
"53033","The aromas are quite bright, with notes of dried cranberry and raspberry along with spice and game. The palate is full of medicine-cabinet and game flavors, seeming a bit dried out.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",53033
"81920","A smoky, lemon and lime dominated wine, which has fine concentration, lifted by tight tannins and edged by a creamy baked apple flavor. There's plenty going on here, and it's all good.","White","Melon","France",81920
"68952","A step up from the Willamette Valley cuvée, this is a barrel selection from the same eight vineyards. One-third was new French oak, adding a hint of toast around wild raspberry fruit with a peppery note.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68952
"34331","Pretty aromas of crushed blue flower and red berry lead the nose on this easygoing red. The fresh palate offers up juicy black cherry and savory herb alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",34331
"85538","An aromatic hint of pine mixes with the red cherry notes on the nose, creating a very appetizing opening. The ultralight palate is translucent and slender, with the same leafy conifer aromas and lots and lots of red currant brightness and freshness. The light crunchy nature of this wine suggests that this is ideal for chilling. It's a weightless, very aromatic, and ultra-light-bodied red.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",85538
"42401","Full bodied and softly tannic, this wine's fruit is front and center, wrapped in a subtle jacket of sweet oak. It dazzles with blackberries, cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate flavors. Drink now for its sheer lusciousness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42401
"34688","The best of a very fine flight of 2010 Pinots from Rex Hill, the La Colina offers a succulent mix of crushed flower, berry and liquid rock. The flavors meld beautifully, with vivid, lively acidity that brings a touch of grapefruit. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Dundee Hills AVA.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",34688
"9236","Raspberry, white pepper, iron, dust and a Earl Grey tea element peek out from the delicate and restrained nose. Plums and red fruits mark the tip of the sip, but it clings to a gravelly, brick-laden center line of minerality, proving pleasantly peppery as well.","Red","Barbera","US",9236
"106459","Coming from the warm 2012 vintage, the notes vary from stone fruit, such as apricot, into tropical with dried pineapple. Aged in a mixture of stainless steel and older French oak barrels, it's fresh and appealing while also displaying some weight and density, drinking quite dry with a tart finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",106459
"10264","Smells good and correct for the variety, with leather, roasted berry and herbal-spicy aromas. Racy and tight in the mouth, with narrowing acidity and forward flavors of red plum, herbs, vanilla and heat.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",10264
"24333","Clearview's Chardonnays are always opulent and textural, and this ultra-luxe offering exemplifies the house style. Aromas of grilled fruit mesh beautifully with toasted whole grain on the nose, while similar flavors swirl endlessly in the mouth. Yet despite being warm and welcoming, full bodied and broad on the palate, it's refreshingly firm on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2016.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",24333
"30028","Simple and slightly sweet, this Central Coast Syrah has blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, Dr. Pepper and fig flavors. It's easy to drink, and finishes soft and spicy.","Red","Syrah","US",30028
"85317","This is a lightly wood-aged wine, full of fruit with just a touch of spice. Smoothly textured, the wine is all the better for an extra year of aging before release. That broadens the fruit while leaving plenty of crispness and fine acidity. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",85317
"91954","Coffee, mocha and spice aromas are followed by flavors of violet, coffee, red berries and spice in this rich, complex Greek red. The finish is dry and spicy. Pair with lamb, semi-hard cheeses, beef.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",91954
"56963","So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry. Explodes in blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with the smoky, buttery toast of oak barrels. Defines deliciousness. The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",56963
"87630","From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this bottling kicks off with peppery spice on the nose along with strong black olive, bay leaf, dill and a black-raspberry element on the edges. Lively underripe fruit tones power the palate, as does Kalamata olive, North African spice, coriander and tomato leaf.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87630
"34968","Aromas of iron, olive, herb, smoke, orange peel and savory notes are followed by a ripe, full savory palate that packs a punch. It's far from shy but manages to keep it all in balance.","Red","Syrah","US",34968
"31444","Uplifting aromatics of blackberry soda and purple flowers provide a nose that could be sniffed all day, hinting at a fun but elegant GSM. The flavors fall in line, with cola, Bing cherries and rose water combining for a light, floral palate, yet with green tea tannins and tartness to keep it grounded.","Red","G-S-M","US",31444
"89739","When it becomes a sweet wine, Chardonnay's natural richness shows immensely. This wine has orange and crystallized orange flavors along with intense concentration. A smooth texture is given just the right lift by acidity.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",89739
"54477","This opens with aromas of new oak, burned rubber, raisin and vanilla. The one-dimensional palate offers candied date, fig, mocha and licorice alongside bracing, grainy tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak spices and astringent tannins.","Red","Barbera","Italy",54477
"86804","Entirely varietal, and given five months to gel in stainless steel, this is a dark copper-red wine that's noticeably earthy on the nose. Dry, woody and a touch sour in cherry and strawberry, it should be enjoyed chilled and with ceviche.","Red","Syrah","US",86804
"2623","A nice, sophisticated Cabernet to drink now Dry and crisp in acidity, it has a solid framework of tannins, giving structure to the blackberry and currant flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",2623
"52594","Luscious and decadent, this Cabernet Franc puts a spotlight on sultry black-cherry flavors. The palate is silky smooth, rimmed with the faintest feather of tannin, yet penetrates long on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",52594
"103469","The high alcohol may be a stumbling block for some palates, but this wine is nonetheless absolutely delicious. Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1972, it was aged in 50% new French oak. It's intense and detailed, with hints of wintergreen, a broad streak of cherry cola, and finishing licks of molasses, brown sugar and coffee.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103469
"72398","A fuller-bodied, richer and denser style of Pinot Noir than many of the producer's other offerings, this one traffics in toasted oak and tannin before revealing dark cherry and leather. Generous, it finishes dry and with power. Cellar through 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72398
"78986","From the winery's estate plantings above Seven Hills Vineyard in the new SeVein project, this wine is still closed aromatically, needing time or air to coax out its vanilla, toast, herb and dark cherry notes. The palate is dense, delivering layer upon layer of dark fruit flavors, with a compelling texture and impeccable balance. It has a long life ahead of it. Best 2022–2028.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",78986
"35523","Just four barrels were produced of this reserve, which sports a distinctive black label. The fruit is chunky and scented strongly with cinnamon. Even with extended airing, the wine feels diffuse, and the flavors thin out rather quickly. A bit disappointing given the vintage.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35523
"51164","A fruity wine that's laced with wood, this is smooth and lightly tannic. The red and black berry fruits are at the fore, supported by a toast character and lifting acidity Age for 1–2 years, but the wine is drinkable now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",51164
"93453","Ripe and aromatic, this encapsulates the Viognier so well. Classic apricot flavors are enhanced by a smoky, wood-aging character, rich almonds and warm acidity. It's a well-composed wine, now ready to drink.","White","Viognier","Portugal",93453
"76612","This shows the bright acidity and pure fruit of Edna Valley, with laser-like orange, pineapple and mango fruit, touched with honey, butter and smoky oak. Very pure and focused, it's a distinctive wine that smacks of its terroir.","White","Chardonnay","US",76612
"44996","Two years of aging on the lees renders incredible textural dimension to this decadently silky dry Riesling. Fresh white grapefruit, lime and lemon notes shine on the palate, offsetting expansive mouthfeel, with acidity that's focused and precise. Stunning already, but should evolve dramatically through 2025.","White","Riesling","Germany",44996
"32207","Deep black plum aromas are enhanced by soy and crushed graphite on the nose of this bottling. It lands on the palate softly, with tangy plum and turned loam flavors, its tannins sticky and persistent.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",32207
"103196","Dense black currants, plum, beef jerky, dark chocolate and licorice show on the rich nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend. Flavors of dried blueberry, toasted sage leaves, thick vanilla and hints of clove swirl into a luxurious sip.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",103196
"82888","This Bordeaux-style blend is nothing like anything from Napa Valley. It's more acidic and tighter, with rustically old-fashioned tannins. Yet the blackberry, cherry, plum and raisin flavors are thoroughly modern. Pleasant now, and should hold for a few years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",82888
"66593","Sweet red cherry fruit melds with whiffs of graham cracker crumb and leather on this ripe, full bodied red from Bogati. There's a thin vein of green that trails throughout, but the palate is nicely structured with a dose of warm pepper notes and mouthcoating tannins on the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",66593
"99616","Packed with strawberry flavors, this ripe wine has plenty of the acidity typical of the vintage along with good fruitiness and structure. The wine is already developing well so drink from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",99616
"37479","Medium-bodied and lush, powered by ripe fruit flavors of apple, peach and pineapple. There's a bit of a flinty note on the nose and a slight vinyl-like element on the finish, which add either complexity or detract from the fruit, depending on your perspective.","White","Riesling","Germany",37479
"73705","Exotic Asian spices and moody, brambly black fruit play at the center of this full-bodied vineyard-designate from a high-elevation site. Citrus, fresh-grated nutmeg and bright acidity make for a savory yet completely succulent experience that'll remain memorable long after the bottle is gone.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73705
"89090","The 2010 Ornellaia celebrates the wine's 25th anniversary, and it could not have been a more spectacular vintage. It opens with aromas of crushed blue flowers, black berries, pipe tobacco and thyme that give way to an elegant, structured and polished palate. It delivers intense blackberry flavors layered with white pepper, Mediterranean herbs, mineral and mocha brightened by fresh acidity alongside smooth, velvety tannins. This will age and develop for decades. Drink 2016–2040.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",89090
"22809","Very high-toned for a relatively affordable wine, this shows Key lime pith, Greek yogurt, scratched pink grapefruit skin and a fresh 7-Up soda liveliness on the nose. Anjou peas, seared green apples, lime zest and nectarine power the pleasant energy on the palate, which wipes up clean with a vanilla finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",22809
"58922","This is purple in color, with a saturated, rubbery aroma that folds in notes of leather, chocolate and blackberry. It's full and lush, with flavors of lemon, grainy oak, coffee and charred black fruit. Dark, oaky and charred on the finish, it needs a lot of air. Predominantly Malbec, with small additions of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.","Red","Malbec","Chile",58922
"104197","Classic fresh, extremely tangy wine, all apple, citrus and crispness. It's lively, although also with some fruit richness. Drink now, with shellfish. Screwcap.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",104197

"39169","This is the winery's top Chardonnay, kept in bottle an extra year prior to release. Even in a challenging vintage such as 2011 it's a huge wine with astonishing concentration and power. The fruit has coiled intensity—so potent that it seems ready to burst wide open. Ripe apple and peach, olive oil, toasted almonds and plenty of new oak flavors abound. It's a jaw-dropper, and may be drunk now through 2022.","White","Chardonnay","US",39169
"77526","The Grand Veneur white relies on a somewhat unusual blend of Viognier, Roussanne and Clairette to yield a svelte, medium-bodied wine. Delicate aromas of pencil shavings and pear lead into a palate boasting pear, melon and tangerine flavors. There's just enough citrusy zest to prolong the finish. Drink now–2020.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",77526
"69787","This own-rooted block is usually blended into Peter Hunken's larger bottling, but this extra-special vintage thankfully got its own stage. Dense boysenberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, charred lamb, dried violets, lilacs and lavender show on the tarry yet floral nose. The palate is zesty with acidity but deep with flavor, offering thyme, soy, rosemary and more peppercorns. It's ideal for a lamb or game dish.","Red","Syrah","US",69787
"51821","The ripe black-cherry fruit brings immediate appeal, in an unapologetically fruity, forward style. The acids are in perfect harmony, and the overall balance is just right, with a juicy, tangy snap to the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51821
"100169","Just the second Chardonnay release from this revived brand, this is built upon Dijon clones 76 and 95, planted in 1995, and aged for just six months in 20% new French oak. It's young and tight, with compressed core flavors of green apple and grapefruit. There's a hint of gun metal, and it punches down the palate with vivid acidity. If you drink it young, decant it, or give it another three to five years of cellaring. Drink now through 2022.","White","Chardonnay","US",100169
"62970","This wine is produced from a quinta owned by João Nicolau d'Almeida, a major figure in the development of Douro grape varieties and Douro wines.

"2598","The flavors of this Pinot, made from pre-Dijon clone Martini selection vines, are fine. They range from cherries and cola to sweet cured tobacco and buttered cinnamon toast to smoky vanilla. If the wine had a crisper, livelier mouthfeel, it would score a lot higher.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2598

"56292","After years of tinkering with Sauvignon Blanc, Grgich Hills has finally produced a truly notable bottling—its best ever. This is lightly oaked, clean and delicious, with tart, lemony acids that provide brightness to the green apple, lemon, lime and pear flavors. The finish is honeyed and spicy.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",56292
"41408","A reserved, interesting bouquet of pine and black fruits isn't overdone or overly oaky. In the mouth, this Cab is powerful and muscular, with a creamy, rich texture.

"74656","A pleasure to taste a Cabernet this rich in fruit, yet one that finishes so dry. It's delicious in blackberries, currants and mocha, wrapped into sweetly smooth tannins. It's a little high in alcohol and soft in acidity. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",74656
"43948","Complex aromas and flavors of blackberries, leather, roasted meat and coffee show plenty of class, and this wine appears to firm up in the glass, offering more structure than its initial suppleness and amplitude suggest. It may close up for a few years, so try it now, or hold and try it after 2012.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",43948
"99371","Rich in thick cherry liqueur-flavored texture, this Sangiovese is dry and tannic with the best of its fruit and tobacco layers popping mid-palate before finishing flat as a straight line.","Red","Sangiovese","US",99371

"85005","True to the vintage, this is a more aromatically brooding wine than often found from this winery, with notes of dark raspberries, vanilla and assorted barrel spices. It's full bodied, layered and rich with cherry and raspberry flavors showing a lot of depth and intensity. Best after 2017.","Red","Merlot","US",85005

"6777","Lamoreaux's standard-label Cabernet Franc spends 18 months in American oak, adopting layers of sweet spice, vanilla and smoke that penetrate deeply into its black cherry core. It's taut and unyielding on the palate, with bold acidity and big, brawny tannins, but should meld beautifully with 3–5 years in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",6777
"43036","A blend of four varieties, this is a full-bodied, plush-textured wine with easy-to-like fruit and spice flavors and a lingering finish.","White","White Blend","US",43036

The tightly wound tannins are quite sticky.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",65279

Still young and compact, it shows succulent green apple and white peach flavors along with toast and butterscotch.","White","Chardonnay","US",18333
"96888","Extremely pale in color and dilute in flavor, this might be reminiscent of watermelon, and could go down easily on a warm day. But there's not much here in the way of actual flavor.","Rosé","Rosé","US",96888
"102530","The Hospices is a charitable organization that has vines in Beaujolais. The wine is ripe with some tannins as well as red fruits. With its structure and concentration, it could age another few months, so wait until 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",102530
"6610","Oak extract, spearmint, espresso and mature plum aromas lead the nose on this simple, medium-bodied wine. The forward palate delivers overripe black berry fruit, vanilla and oak that finish on an almost sugary-sweet note. It's already evolved so drink soon.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",6610
"27553","New leather, pressed blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of game are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut, structured red. The palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and vanilla flavors, while assertive, close-grained tannins give the finish grip. Give this time to let those tannins mellow. Drink 2018–2026.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",27553
"74971","Iodine and celery aromas dominate the nose, which offers mild fruit-driven scents of apple and lime.

A cleansing finish can best be described as fresh.","White","Verdejo","Spain",74971
"94317","This wine shows bacon fat, boysenberry and tarragon on the nose. It's full and ripe on the palate, bringing similar flavors, also showing blackberry, roasted pork and black pepper. It proves quite delicious and just what one expects from a warmer-climate Syrah.","Red","Syrah","US",94317

Concentrated flavors of raspberry purée hold down the core.","Red","Syrah","Canada",101897

"82948","Wonderfully rich, with a lush and luxurious mid-palate, this young wine is packed with berries and cassis, elevated with some citrusy acidity, and deep with notes of gravel and smoke.

"27811","At first the aroma is sharp, even clumsy, showing herbs, peanuts and even bacon fat. The fruit is in the big-plum range. A heavy dose of oak has been thrown at this wine, so it’s buttery on the palate and coffee-tinged on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27811
"91498","With layers of nutty, toasty oak flavors lingering in the background, this is a Sauvignon Blanc with lushness to its core of melon, guava and grass notes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",91498
"14584","Sleepy and tannic, this wine is elusive in fruit both aromatically and on the palate, showing more green, herbal character than cherry or berry. Still, it is hugely full bodied and wrapped forcefully in oak, providing a dry finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",14584
"6195","Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint. The vintage was a difficult one for St. Supéry. The wine is lacks the stuffing for ageability. Drink now–2013.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",6195
"9977","A proportion of the grapes in this wine, accented with 2% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, comes from the Lewis Vineyard, a respected site in the heart of the appellation.

"40710","A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years.","Red","Merlot","US",40710

"101506","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (33%), Merlot (33%), Petit Verdot (16%), Malbec (16%) and Cabernet Franc (2%) delivers high toned notes of cocoa, purple flower, green herb and plum, showing whiffs of volatility. The palate is velvety-smooth, with plentiful dark fruit and chocolate flavors backed by burly tannins. Give it time to stretch its legs.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",101506
"43748","This medium- to full-bodied red features bright fruit accented by oak. Vanilla strongly marks the nose, yet cherry and raspberry also come through, tinged with baking spices. Crisp and firm on the finish; try pairing with rich cuts of red meat.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",43748
"74843","This is a bright lemon and grapefruit flavored wine that has lively acidity and the lightest touch of mineral texture. It's crisp, refreshing and will be ready to drink from mid-2016.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",74843
"82623","Lively acidity defined by a taste of lemon peel meets heftier overtones of fresh pear, providing a medium-bodied texture that should work well at the table. The finish highlights the lemony aspects of the wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",82623
"40714","Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",40714
"12935","This wine has great potential to emerge as a classic in the years to come, but is a bit tightly wound right now. Hearty roasted plum and blackberry aromas are coated in smoke, chocolate shavings and subtle violet on the nose. The sip starts bright before the strong tannins take hold, hiding the dark berry and minty flavors.","Red","Syrah","US",12935
"33743","Very ripe and oaky. Bursts with pineapple pie filling, tapioca, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Could use some complexity and restraint.","White","Chardonnay","US",33743
"15025","An unbalanced wine, with harsh tannins and some overripe, pruny flavors. Oddly enough, there also are underripe, green notes.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15025
"66504","Soft in tannins and acids, this Cabernet has a gentle, drink-me-now mouthfeel. The flavors are rich and sweet in milk chocolate, blueberries and blackberries. Easy to like, if a little pricey for what you get.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66504
"40960","Lime and passion fruit aromas are subtle and appealing. This delivers a fresh, alert palate and crisp, lightly brined flavors of lettuce, apple and cucumber. On the finish, it runs peppery but not overly aggressive.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",40960
"50288","Named for the proprietor's daughter, Taylor's is stainless-steel fermented and meant to exude juicy waves of pear, apple and lemon, a fully immersive expression of fruit and minerality. Well balanced, it shows a tease of peach fuzz and the crispness of never having met a swath of oak.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",50288
"11682","Fermented in stainless steel and concrete, this Sauvignon Blanc packs some pungency on the nose, with aromas of green coffee bean, drying grass, peach yogurt and ripe apricot. Medium to full in body, the acids are dynamic enough to charge the flower and mineral flavors. Pair this with pan-seared sea scallops served in a tarragon beurre blanc.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",11682
"98858","Still young and tight, this terroir-driven Chardonnay needs further cellaring to show its best. Woody scents top off crisp, persistent tree fruits, with lemony acids propping up flavors. It's dense, compact and unyielding, but clearly the raw materials for ageworthiness are there.","White","Chardonnay","US",98858
"73900","Aromas of sweet berry fruit and cherry lean toward medicinal. The palate is juicy due to bold acidity, and the flavors settle on main street cherry. There's a buttery oak note on the finish, but overall it's more basic and fruity than supple and complex.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",73900
"17937","There's a tight, muted quality to this wine. While it floods the mouth with cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, the acids and tannins are Burgundian, suggesting ageability. You can drink it now, but decanting is advisable. Otherwise, stick it in the cellar until sometime in 2009 or 2010.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",17937
"100245","Tastes jellied with LifeSaver candy flavors of blackberries and cherries. This one is good, but far less interesting, than Baldacci's '04 Cab.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",100245
"25933","This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now–2012.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",25933
"64536","Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",64536
"12603","This is tight, crisp and herbaceous, dominated by Sauvignon Blanc. A mineral character gives a firm texture. It needs to age a few months, so drink from 2015.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",12603
"7501","Menthol, crushed flower, red raspberry and savory herb aromas unfold in the glass. The palate conveys juicy red cherry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside supple tannins. It's surprisingly accessible for such a young Barolo. Drink 2016–2022.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",7501
"9863","Beautifully rich and ripe in cherries, raspberries and sweet smoky cedar, this Pinot is fully drinkable now, although decanting will help. But it's also an ager. Shows a mushroomy dryness and herbal grounding that suggest improvement through 2013.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9863
"39645","Nice everyday wine, with pleasant peach, pineapple and pear flavors that finish with a touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's easy to enjoy this one with ham, crab, corn on the cob or just by itself.","White","Chardonnay","US",39645
"16993","Tom Meadowcroft's second label, Thomas Henry, is also sourcing from Borden Ranch in Lodi, as is his slightly higher-priced, lower-alcohol Riesling under the Meadowcroft name. This one not as as fragrant at first, more austere, but fully inviting wih melon, honey and pear. Thai food would be the perfect pairing.","White","Riesling","US",16993
"90510","This restrained, focused, well priced and crowd-pleasing Chardonnay shows butter, Gravenstein apple, Meyer lemon and almond touches on the nose. On the palate, poached apple fruit is interwoven with lemon and vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",90510
"99598","Staunch but murky aromas of coffee grounds, leafy berry, olive and lemon peel announce a tight raw palate. Flavors of olive, plum skins and herbs finish with a reprise of spent coffee along with scratchy tannins.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",99598
"3027","This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.","Red","Red Blend","US",3027
"29650","Rocca delle Macìe's bright Morellino is an immediate and direct wine that refreshes the palate and promises easy pairing opportunities with most Italian dishes. Aromas include soft cherry and succulent blueberry.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",29650
"82885","With its stumpy, old fashioned bottle and cork, this is an LBV for aging. It is perfumed and smooth, with a core of solid tannins and a firm texture. Black fruits and just the right amount of sweetness balance the dryness of the spirit. Keep for several years, or drink now.","Port","Port","Portugal",82885
"28797","Using the four main grapes of the Dão region—Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen—this is an impressive wine, with solid tannins and a crushed-stone texture. Black currant fruits are set against perfumed acidity and a dense structure which needs to soften for the wine to be fully ready. Drink this wine from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",28797
"45367","Olive, saucy berry and a sense of rawness on the nose drive this Malbec towards a solid but slightly scratchy feeling palate. Plum, blackberry and minty oak flavors are short and lightly herbal, while this ends without much force.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",45367
"95587","Though Syrah is not new to Southern Oregon, the recent rise in quality may surprise you. DanCin's Danseur is estate-grown in the Applegate Valley. It's an aromatic, tightly woven gem, loaded with plum, berry and kirsch, highlights of herb and bramble and a finish streaked with chocolate, espresso and licorice. Tannins are polished and the flavors linger delightfully.","Red","Syrah","US",95587
"53188","Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.","Red","Syrah","Argentina",53188
"105237","This medium-bodied Chardonnay is a bit tart and austere. Understated smoke and melon aromas lead the way, while the flavors are lemony, finishing on a slightly sour note.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",105237
"79789","Intense, generous aromas of white flower, passion fruit, citrus blossom and crushed stone comprise the nose. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay offers impressive intensity and a long, spicy finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",79789
"3829","This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",3829
"56545","From the Prail region of Alto Adige, this stunning, intense Sauvignon is full of grassy, herbaceous flavors. It is still young, needing time to lose its grapefruit character and ripen into a fine, aromatic wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Italy",56545
"82251","Cherry, sage, blackberry and white pepper mingle to make a refreshing and rounded wine ideal for uncomplicated pleasure. Drink now, preferably with canapés or a light lunch where its beautiful and resonant aftertaste of red cherry will impress.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",82251
"12173","Raspberry, dark cherry, cola and vanilla aromas are harmonious and introduce a tight, racy, pure palate with toughness and grip. Bold flavors of cassis, cherry, black pepper and vanilla finish with oak-based notes of mocha and vanilla, all pushed to the fore by juicy acidity. Drink through 2019.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",12173
"14696","A good grip of acidity and tannins shape the fruity, earthy aromas and crisp raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's a very lively, refreshing style that is not overripe, and will be great with all kinds of food.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14696
"106593","Cool, minty aromas of blueberry and blackberry set up a full, tannic palate, which is what you'd expect from a young Ribera del Duero. Grabby, tannic fullness offers flavors of meaty black fruits, herbs and tobacco. A savory finish runs long on a frame of blocky tannins.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",106593
"34350","Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",34350
"71584","This is juicy, almost jammy, with forward flavors of strawberry candy that fill the mouth and hang tight. There's a light hint of pepper around a lingering, clean finish. It's full, forward and fruit-powered.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71584
"81148","A blend of Corvina, Rondinella and Merlot, this has aromas reminiscent of black-skinned berry, wild cherry and white pepper. The supple, vibrant palate delivers black currant, clove and a touch of pomegranate alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",81148
"65284","Considered warm by Central Coast standards, Paso Robles is not always ideal for Chardonnay, but the veteran squad at Castoro did well on this nicely tight bottling. Key-lime pith and crisp Gala apple show on the nose, while solid acidity delivers flavors of rainy slate and squeezed citrus. There's good grippy tension to the sip as well.","White","Chardonnay","US",65284
"101142","A smooth and ripe rosé from Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, this is a cherry and red berry flavored wine. It has weight and a rich texture that are balanced by the crisp raspberry and fresh apple brightness at the end. Drinkble beginning now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",101142
"18884","Aromas of baked earth, black plum and cocoa lift out of the glass. Round and juicy, the palate delivers mature blackberry, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Barbera","Italy",18884
"7910","Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth.","White","Viognier","US",7910
"45746","This is a dark, dense and brooding Bordeaux-style blend, comprised of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. Notes of cocoa, cigar tobacco and leather jazz up the black-fruit core of cassis, black plum and berry. The palate is full and gripping, with firm tannins that hang on tightly through the long and slightly smoky finish. Drink after decanting now, or enjoy through 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","South Africa",45746
"79425","A halo of waxy pollen lingers over fresh peach and lemon aromas. The palate is muddled with vague stone-fruit flavors, with crisp acidity leading to a short, simple finish.","White","Albariño","US",79425
"25959","The Peju style is of soft, ripe voluptuousness, making this the kind of wine that's enormously attractive to drink now. This '11 Syrah is immediately appealing for its raspberry, cherry and oak flavors, but it's the mouthfeel that's special. With modest alcohol, it feels smooth, silky and clean. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",25959
"77055","A tough, gritty, drily astringent wine with flavors of raisins and cedar. Turns bitter on the finish. Syrah, Sangiovese and Viognier.","Red","Red Blend","US",77055
"37402","Tastes hot and strong, a heavy wine with earthy, tobacco flavors softened with a hint of briary berry. Totally dry, with an astringent finish.","Red","Merlot","US",37402
"91659","Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance. The beautiful tannins and the fragrant black currant fruits are palpable. It's a great wine, with huge potential.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",91659
"55008","Intense violet, red-skinned berry and cooking spice aromas set the stage in this bright red. The lively palate delivers red cherry, blackberry and cinnamon touches alongside round tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy soon.","Red","Barbera","Italy",55008
"55457","Fruity, ripe and yummy, this wine offers aromas that are spicy and slightly oaky from 14 months in mostly American barrels. The flavors are packed with ripe cherry and blackberry. Despite very full body in terms of alcohol, the texture is smooth, tannins are light and the finish lingers.","Red","Zinfandel","US",55457
"86084","Blackberry, ripe plum, kitchen spice and moist earth aromas lead the nose. The straightforward, easy-drinking, palate offers black cherry, white pepper and a hint of anise alongside lively acidity.","Red","Barbera","Italy",86084
"70104","A hint of black, intense elderberry steals away almost as soon as it appears. Intriguing blueberry and plum remain on a slender, supple and lissom palate that is dense and toned. There is focus, concentration and purity, framed by stony notes, smoky oak and great freshness. This will take time to relax, so drink 2018–2025.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",70104
"80073","The recent vintages from this Santa Maria-based winery of actress Challen Cates and winemaker Kevin Law are some of the most impressive wines out there. This is dark in the glass, with a rich bouquet of cinnamon-clove foam, black plum pudding and hot pastry. It hits the palate with panache and power, showing allspice, dried ginger and sharp cola notes atop rich black cherry fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80073
"103904","Structured despite its impermeable presence of power and alcohol, this wine also sings in crisp red fruit, some of it jammy, but self-possessed. An accompaniment of anise and baked bread play on the sturdy palate.","Red","Zinfandel","US",103904
"90228","A copper rose hue, this has a strong phenolic grip and a burst of heat at the finish. There's good texture, with wild strawberry and a push toward cherry-fruit flavor, with a wash of citrusy acid.","Rosé","Rosé","US",90228
"61425","Sweet aromas of white peach entice one into this lively wine, a profile that carries through to the delicate palate. A refreshing apéritif that finishes dry, the wine is light in alcohol and body.","White","Moscato","US",61425
"86490","While rich, this wine is well balanced with its fresh acidity and wild strawberry flavors. Citrus and a tangy orange texture are both attractive and give the wine a great lift. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",86490
"46771","This is a luscious wine, ripe with honeyed fruit and edged with botrytis. Apricot and peach dominate the fruit profile, laced with bitter marmalade and touches of acidity. The wine has a toffee aftertaste that emphasizes its richness. Drink from 2018.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",46771
"7253","Aromas of menthol, red berry, coffee and blue flower waft from the glass along with whiffs of chopped aromatic herb. The aromas follow through to the velvety palate along with Marasca cherry, raspberry and licorice. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide a structured framework. Drink 2025–2033.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",7253
"14712","The aromas are light on this wine with notes of dried herbs, mocha and anise. It's soft and elegant in its styling but with rich fruit flavors and dry, chalky tannins.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",14712
"60895","This is open and generous, a soft wine that will be ready to drink soon. It still has some firm structure although that serves as a support to the blackberry fruit flavors. The aftertaste is juicy and fresh.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",60895
"11900","Waxy slightly bitter aromas of peach pit give way to a palate with grip. This tastes salty and like white melon, while on the finish what fruit there is fades out quickly. Hailing from Chile's deep south, this is complex and challenging more than ripe.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",11900
"32808","This wine sources this rare variety from Saralee's Vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Meaty strawberry meets refreshing acidity and ample structure, taming the big boldness of flavor, all while remaining light and bright in the glass.","Red","Tannat","US",32808
"64511","This well-made wine has appealing aromas of milk chocolate, coffee and plum. The style is lighter, with the concentration not seeming quite all there, but it still provides plenty of appeal with its elegance. Put it at the dinner table to see it at its best.","Red","Syrah","US",64511
"97994","Dry and well balanced but also full flavored, this will be a great go-to bubbly to have ready in the fridge for any minor or major occasion. There are ripe fruits along with crisp citrus notes, lively acidity, a rich mousse of bubbles and lingering finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",97994
"39813","Smooth, deep and fairly complex on the bouquet, with concentrated dark fruit aromas blending with coconut. The palate shows structure, tightness and full but integrated tannins, while the flavors of black fruits, herbs, tea and spice set up a full, toasted finish that satisfies. Drink now through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",39813
"25200","A really nice wine, refreshing and light, with delicate lemon-grapefruit flavors complexed with creamy lees. The acidity is very crisp and assertive. No discernible oak at all, and with this pretty fruit and structure, it doesn't need any.","White","Pinot Gris","US",25200
"3550","This is a nicely made Marlborough Sauvignon at an attractive price, with herbal, grassy notes and a touch of bell pepper backed by underlying tropical fruit. It's round without being soft, retaining sufficient crispness to serve alone or with seafood.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",3550
"66264","Meaty aromas suggest baked berry, prune and other ripe fruits. The palate is almost soupy in its richness, while flavors of molasses, berry and toast are ripe and concentrated. A roasted-tasting finish features notes of cooked brown sugar.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",66264
"76292","La Collina dei Lecci offers a clean but compact Riserva Brunello with bright bursts of white cherry and forest berry followed by light accents of smoke and spice. With medium intensity and structure, this food-friendly alternative would match risotto or pasta.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",76292
"72248","Leather, game, underbrush, dried herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas take shape in the glass. The big, chewy palate has a rustic charm, offering fleshy black cherry, game, truffle and a hint of cake spice wrapped in tightly packed tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",72248
"11770","This wine is an unusual blend of Barbera (40%), Malbec (25%), Sangiovese (21%) and Cabernet Franc. It works, with aromas of sweet baking spices, vanilla, cherry and herb that are followed by generous, velvety cherry flavors. The oak is very primary but it still brings appeal.","Red","Red Blend","US",11770
"69850","Like pepper in your Syrahs? This one's for you. It's distinctly Californian, in the superripe blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors. The appealing softness suggests drinking now.","Red","Syrah","US",69850
"73334","The nose is still dominated by funky yeast, signaling that this Riesling requires time in bottle. The streamlined palate reveals something that is equally generous and tart, like pink grapefruit or pomelo. There is a lovely phenolic texture, too, with intimations of riper fruit in the background that will still take their time to appear. Best to let this slumber for a while in a cool cellar. Drink as of 2018.","White","Riesling","Austria",73334
"74412","A bit reticent on the nose, showing hints of struck flint, lime and custard, but this tightly coiled Chard shows its true brilliance in the mouth, revealing complex fruit flavors of lime and lemon, but also slightly riper notes: apple and white peach come to mind. The bright core of acids shines on the long, refreshing finish. Should age comfortably through 2015, at least.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",74412
"49921","From what is always the Grand Cru that develops most quickly, this is a gorgeous, already very drinkable, ripe wine, certainly fresh. Maybe there is a more mineral character than usual, allied to higher acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",49921
"99546","One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.","Red","Tempranillo","US",99546
"90786","Firm tannins and concentrated black fruit flavors set this wine up for long-term aging. It has a solid core that gives it dryness at this young stage. But the bold blackberry fruit and acidity will come through to produce a generous, balanced wine. Drink from 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",90786
"32183","The heady scent of baked apple and candied orange peel merges into a citrus-zesty, supersweet but tight palate. Sugar-crusted citrus peel—orange, mandarin and tangerine—play about the palate alongside a notion of fragrant pine resin. A rarity and source of pure joy. If you have a fruitcake laced with candied peel, don't hold back.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",32183
"103979","Composed berry aromas meet expectations for Tinto Fino from Ribera del Duero. A stout, tannic palate is firm but not too hard or impermeable. Flavors of blackberry and cherry come with dry, woody accents, while peppery blackness rises up on a drawing finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",103979
"79456","Black cherry fruit is followed by notes of espresso, leather, crushed granite, cola and licorice. The wine shows bright acidity in the mouth but it also has enough fruity pulp and density to soften that sharpness. Pair this wine with spicy baby-back ribs.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",79456
"78831","Initial aromas of chlorine and raw plum settle and become more fruity and attractive with airing. This shows a forward fresh sassy palate with clipped rugged tannins. Ample oak and salty berry flavors veer towards clove and cinnamon prior to a scraping tough finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",78831
"43795","Made with a blend of 85% Falanghina and 15% Pallagrello Bianco, this opens with citrus, graphite and stone fruit aromas. The linear palate offers white peach, yellow grapefruit, lemon zest and mineral alongside lively acidity.","White","White Blend","Italy",43795
"28991","Made from 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot and aged in 100% new oak for 20 months, this is a burly red wine with impressive structure and presence. Tangy red fruit, recalling cranberry and currant, is spiced with clove, mountain sage, bay leaf and molasses notes.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",28991
"7193","Zesty lemons and limes are perfumed with whiffs of orange blossom on this brisk, revitalizing dry Riesling. Tart tangerine acidity penetrates deeply on the palate, leading a finish that's crisp and clean.","White","Riesling","US",7193
"106266","Here's a concentrated Valpolicella that opens with aromas of new leather, truffle, French oak and a balsamic note. The firm palate shows raisin, fig and oak-driven spice alongside close-grained tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",106266
"21887","This structured, tight wine has complex almond and spice flavors that partner with crisp acidity and tangy lemon zest and grapefruit accents. The texture with its minerality and tight aftertaste promises aging. Drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",21887
"100553","The Celilo vineyard has contributed the fruit to many outstanding Chardonnays from a who's who list of winemakers, but none better than this. Intensely concentrated and deeply extracted, it explodes with marvelously pure fruit flavors—the full range of citrus, citrus peel and crisp tree fruits. A wine with perfect virtually balance, exceptional texture and amazing length.","White","Chardonnay","US",100553
"45034","This densely structured, finely crafted wine is the latest vintage from one of the Douro's iconic brands. It has great weight and, at the same time, elegant fruits and structure that offer good aging potential. It could be drunk now, but best to wait until 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",45034
"42524","This brilliant Chardonnay has the ripe citrus and tropical fruit you want, but is also refined in winemaker technique, particularly a leesy note that marries well with the pineapples in sweet clotted cream. The oak is perfect and the acidity lovely in this wonderfully drinkable wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",42524
"29240","This wine was inadvertently tasted against a bunch of Barossa giants, so I may have underestimated it. It still held its own, delivering subtle notes of plum, cinnamon and clove, plus hints of olive and mocha. It's medium in body, with some herbal notes, yet finishes dusty and mouthwatering. Drink now–2028.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",29240
"92305","Here is a very likeable Prosecco with lime flavors and aromas of mint leaf and lemon ice sorbet. It has a remarkably creamy and smooth texture in the mouth—like citrus cream—and a nervous touch of crisp acidity on the close.","Sparkling","Prosecco","Italy",92305
"5344","Light in color, sketchy on the nose and dilute on the palate, all of which means this has discernible issues. Bland flavors suggest grape skins, while this is flat, wheaty and yeasty tasting on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Spain",5344
"90617","This wine opens with a pretty fragrance of blue flower, black fruit and spice. The juicy palate is one dimensional but delicious, offering ripe black cherry and blackberry layered with milk chocolate. It's extremely accessible so enjoy soon.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",90617
"81124","The oak sticks out and the underlying cherry and raspberry fruit is rather simple and jammy in this single-vineyard wine. It has positive features, such as a dry silkiness and a nice mushroomy character. But it turns disappointingly thin on the finish. Too bad for a vineyard that used to be among the best in Carneros.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81124
"89132","Direct and woody on the nose, with aromas of graphite and vanilla, this opens in fine form. A tight, pure palate deftly blends weight, fine acidity and chewy tannins, while the flavor profile is earthy and blackened by charred oak, with blackberry fruit and savory, peppery spice notes. This is meaty, savory and beefy on the finish. Drink through 2021.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",89132
"103298","While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",103298
"94167","Clearview's Chardonnays are always opulent and textural, and this ultra-luxe offering exemplifies the house style. Aromas of grilled fruit mesh beautifully with toasted whole grain on the nose, while similar flavors swirl endlessly in the mouth. Yet despite being warm and welcoming, full bodied and broad on the palate, it's refreshingly firm on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2016.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",94167
"20699","This is a full-bodied, solid wine, dominated at this early stage in its development by tannins as well as black currant fruits. The wine is potentially warm, perfumed with truffles and spice. Age for a couple of years.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",20699
"89441","Fruit fans will exult in this jammy Pinot Noir. It floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries and cola, with an elaborate coating of sweet, smoky sandalwood. The richness is balanced with fine acidity. Best now and over the next year or so.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",89441
"62059","Earthy aromas of black-currant leaf and crushed carnation dominate the profile of this wine, with light black-fruit notes taking second place. Lean and delicate, this wine is ready for drinking now; pair it with wine-braised brisket.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Israel",62059
"58106","The alcohol is hefty but balanced, giving the wine a heat it wears well. The tannins are big and thick, while the fruit is all about ripe black cherries and chocolate. It hits the sweet spot, but finishes dry. Drink now–2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58106
"93696","Herbal aromas, a chunky palate and herbal cherry and plum flavors finish earthy and with a raisiny element. This is sort of amorphous and mealy on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",93696
"100435","This polished and structured Barolo presents rich fruit and floral scents of black cherry, plum and rose. The dark fruit and spice flavors layered with eucalyptus and balsamic notes are delicious. It's still young, with bracing but ripe tannins that need to soften, but this already shows great complexity.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",100435
"36280","Produced from young vines, this is a fresh, fruity, and crisp wine. It has attractive apple and pear flavors, brightened further by citrus overtones. Drink this attractive wine now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",36280
"85273","Heavy wood masks the fruit in this wine, leaving a dense and dry toasty character. Only underneath are there signs of fresher acidity and black-currant fruits. Wait until 2019. Denis Dubourdieu and Christophe Ollivier consult with manager Philippe Lacoste for the Beraud-Sudreau family.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",85273
"11460","A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Malbec, 19% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, spicy aromas of leather, black pepper, savory herbs, licorice and Mexican chocolate lead the nose. It's grounded by a solid fruit core of blackberry, boysenberry and mulberry fruit, lending a supporting spine to the toasted spice and earthy accents. Well balanced, with velvety tannins and a long, evolving finish, drink this lush, velvety red from 2018–2024.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","South Africa",11460
"39096","This is sharp as a knife, with peppery herbs in the foreground, a hint of anise, and plenty of crisp, green apple fruit. It's got a refreshing gin-like citrus rind character, with hints of pineapple and a lick of butter on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",39096
"74464","A juicy wine, it is full of black currant fruits and vanilla wood flavors. It is generous, rounded with fine acidity and a fresh, open feel. Dry tannins will help the wine age for the medium-term. Drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",74464
"83168","The nose here is deeply redolent of fresh fruit with distinct tones of peach, apricot, citrus, Granny Smith apple and pear. Additional complexity is added by background tones of spring flowers, almond and baked biscuits.","Sparkling","Prosecco","Italy",83168
"52757","Inviting notions of damask rose signal richness and aromatic opulence and continue on the rounded, plush and almost oily palate. It provides a textbook example of rich Alsace Gewurztraminer that shows rose-petal richness tamed by fresh orange-peel zestiness.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",52757
"83428","Cotton candy and apple cider aromas give way to a mild palate with soft acidity but a sense of complexity. Plump red-fruit flavors are not specific, and overall this blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha is appealing but slightly vacuous.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",83428
"47806","Light in weight and texture, this wine was aged in both French and American oak. Smokiness surrounds the otherwise restrained offerings of plum, dark cherry and herb.","Red","Merlot","US",47806
"63538","Produced from organically grown grapes, this wine is full of fragrant, clean red-fruit flavors. It is ripe and full bodied—perhaps too full-bodied for a really fresh rosé. It does have all the fruit, generous and with a soft aftertaste.","Rosé","Rosé","France",63538
"37739","Superripe mirabelles and the juiciest pears appear on the nose and fill the mind with heady perfume. The palate confirms this notion of sweetness with ample residual sugar. However, this is met with precise acidity to create unusual thrill. This just sits on a knife's edge between juicy ripe pear and mouth-watering grapefruit zest—a wonderful interplay of notions that makes this incredibly enticing. This is starting to develop and has way to go with its playful, medium-dry finish. Drink 2017–2030.","White","Pinot Gris","France",37739
"6851","There's a bit of oak in this Riesling, just enough to give some mellowness to the tart apricot, citrus and white flower flavors. It's bone dry and acidic, with a mineral intensity that finishes with elegance and style.","White","Riesling","US",6851
"23180","A powerful waft of red fruit and tannin combine for an agreeable wine that'll do well across palates, appealing to those who like some weight and body to their wine and to others who like a wine priced under $30. Either way, give it some time to air in the glass: it's still very much a baby.","Red","Red Blend","US",23180
"91066","Firm, fruity, with tropical flavors and lots of alcohol. The flavors are tight and contained, the fruit tends to strawberry, and the finish is tannic.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91066
"21563","Made partly with late-harvested grapes and aged in large casks, this ripe wine leads with aromas of fragrant white flowers, lychee, pear and a delicate note of vanilla. The round palate offers juicy tropical fruit, golden apple and lemon pastry with a flinty, mineral finish.","White","Garganega","Italy",21563
"37098","Baked strawberry, burnt orange and rose petal combine aromatically and on the palate in this moderately flat wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37098
"61671","The wine is all about crisp juicy fruit. It has only the lightest texture—just apple and citrus acidity. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",61671
"104616","The wine served at Vienna's famed Opera Ball, this is crisp, herbaceous with apple and citrus fruits already showing a totally refreshing character. It would benefit from a few months in bottle. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",104616
"57592","Credit this Merlot for sheer enjoyability. It defines Merlot as the soft, drink-me-now Bordeaux red wine, full-bodied yet instantly likeable. Made from 100% Merlot, it's extraordinairly rich in cherry fruit, while 100% new French oak adds a deft touch of buttered toast. The tannins are gentle, sweet and complex. This flashy, fleshy wine is great now, and will hold and evolve in the bottle for at least six years.","Red","Merlot","US",57592
"94898","Succulent pomegranate, persimmon and raspberry flavors make this wine an instant delight. The richness is brightened by tart acidity, while oak brings just the right touch of buttered cinnamon toast. A lovely Pinot Noir for drinking now with upscale fare.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94898
"83102","Polished and flavorful, and a good price for this wealth of creamy pineapples, limes and peaches. Really rich all the way through to the spicy finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",83102
"53841","Renieri delivers that style of austere and elegant Brunello that begs for a steak dinner on a cold winter night. The wine is fleshy and thickly concentrated, with bright highlights of cherry, plum, cinnamon and a touch of crushed clove.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",53841
"87497","Red violet in the glass, this blend of 85% Öküzgözü and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon has a nose of butterscotch and black cherry. Flavors do not coalesce completely, with cool notes of menthol and clove prevailing over flavors of tart cherry, raspberry and a hint of iodine.","Red","Red Blend","Turkey",87497
"61323","Rubbery, jammy, unfocused berry aromas are blurry. This feels heavy and low on pulse. Flavors of stewed plum and berry fruits end with a mild, weedy, green note.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",61323
"21701","The aromas are quite subdued with notes of herbs and red fruit. The flavors are more generous but still come off as quite light.","Red","Malbec","US",21701
"102814","Zinfandel is joined by Mourvèdre and a few other minor grape varieties in this overtly sweet, high alcohol wine. It's soft and glyceriney, with cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate and pepper flavors. You have to give it credit for being true to its style.","Red","Zinfandel","US",102814
"80047","Meant to reflect the three elements of terroir, nature and man, this small-production wine is well represented in compost, dried herb, mild tannin and oak. The acidity is moderate and in some ways disjointed, while the finish features highlights of vanilla and currant.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80047
"73064","A heavier style of Rioja, with raisin and prune aromas and a brandied character. The palate is expectedly flush and ripe, with weight and size along with black cherry and herbal tea flavors. Shows good stamina and fullness on the finish. Ready to drink now before it starts to fade.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",73064
"20324","This is a rich, jammy wine, with ripe raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Blended with a little Merlot and Petit Verdot, it's made in the popular style, featuring sweet fruit with a touch of oak. The tannins are pretty thick, and the wine might improve with a few years in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",20324
"95826","This hard-edged wine has bitter chocolate as well as black-currant flavors. Quite young at this stage, this is a dark, powerful, concentrated wine that has both great fruit and a dense structure. Give it four years to mature.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",95826
"37880","Oak, toast, espresso and stewed prune carry over to the palate together with a note of dark cooking spice. Assertive, close-grained tannins give this an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then drink up to enjoy the remaining fruit. Drink after 2018.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",37880
"86251","Cabernet Sauvignon (80%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of high-toned green herbs, spice, black cherry and blackberry lead to lively cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a sense of freshness, though at times it seems a bit green.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",86251
"37145","Aromas of aromatic herb, dark berry, eucalyptus, iris and a whiff of espresso float out of the glass. The vibrant assertive palate shows black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated oak sensations framed in youthfully austere tightly knit tannins. This needs time to unwind and fully develop.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",37145
"102862","This is not a true fortified wine but one made from late-harvest Tannat with some added alcohol before fermentation. It produces a delicious wine with superripe blackberry flavors and some tannins. Sweet and rich, it is ready to drink now.","Red","Tannat","France",102862
"98125","Vibrant white grapefruit and crisp-tart peach and pear notes penetrate throughout this subtly off-dry Riesling. While light on its feet and irresistibly refreshing, it reverberates with a long, cool steeliness on the finish. Drink now through 2021.","White","Riesling","Germany",98125
"19566","So dry and zesty in acidity, it really gets the tastebuds watering. The flavors start slow, then crank up toward the finish, suggesting ripe white peaches, summer white flowers and savory spices. Delicate and elegant, this is what Pinot Gris ought to be.","White","Pinot Gris","US",19566
"84927","Jammy aromas, sweet-seeming baking spice flavors and a texture that's relatively soft for a red wine make this easy to drink and rich in flavor.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",84927
"32611","Notes of pressed apple and orange rind are brightened by splashes of lemon and spice in this robustly full-bodied wine. Savory apple and pear flavors lend a rustic tone but its mouth-clinging texture is lavish and lingering. It's a bold wine but balances neatly without any alcoholic heat.","White","Chardonnay","US",32611
"17162","True bargains are hard to come by, so drop your guard for this $8 SB and you may wind up happy. Xplorador from Concha Y Toro is peachy and simple, with light grassiness and green notes. But it does have a plump, neutral palate and likable pineapple and apple flavors. Inoffensive and not flashy, but good for the money.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",17162
"1868","This is the lightest of the Grüners from Proidl, offering a refreshing burst of crisp acidity along with the freshest spice. There is a fine tang of lemon, to keep the whole wine as bright as possible.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",1868
"18135","The winery has struggled with Pinot made from this warm, sunny highland appellation, which is more suitable for Zinfandel. Their '06 is a savory wine, dry and rich in cherries and oak, with a silky texture. But there's a heaviness that makes you think Pinot isn't the best grape to grow this far above the Anderson Valley fogline.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18135
"38819","The characteristic 2014 acidity makes a lovely lemony splash in the center of this dry, refreshing wine. Lemon freshness rises from the glass, offering lots of verve and a lip-smacking finish.","White","Riesling","France",38819
"3450","There's a hint of sauvage to this dry, racy white. On the palate, glimpses of mineral and fresh herbs, as well as an irresistable tang of salt lend complexity to fresh gooseberry and lemon flavors. It's delicately concentrated, but invigorating.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",3450
"105071","This wine takes a kitchen-sink approach, blending 28% Syrah with sizable percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah, as well as small additions of Merlot, Malbec and Zinfandel. It works, offering a dryness of red fruit, cedar and tobacco in an understated, medium-bodied package.","Red","Red Blend","US",105071
"629","A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.","Red","Syrah","US",629
"71743","100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Wallula Vineyard, this brooding wine screams of the Horse Heaven Hills with notes of dusty earth, black currant, and bittersweet chocolate. It's tightly coiled and largely about structure with its firm tannins supporting concentrated cherry flavors. Needs time to come into its own but has the stuffing to lay down for a decade or more.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71743
"15727","Bright and elegant, this opens with aromas of blue flower, woodland berry, baking spice and a whiff of toasted oak. The sleek, savory palate doles out sour cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and a hint of thyme alongside polished tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",15727
"38178","This well-crafted reserve boasts a solid core of blueberry and black cherry fruit, thickly accented with dark chocolate notes. Produced from heritage (Calera, Swan and Mt. Eden) clones, it's textural and dense, with dark char, espresso and black licorice flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",38178
"60779","Ripe black-skinned berry, menthol, new leather and a whiff of iris lead the nose. The vibrant, juicy palate offers wild cherry, black raspberry, star anise and Mediterranean herb while fine-grained tannins provide an elegant, youthfully austere framework. Drink 2017–2022.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",60779
"88176","A pretty pale-pink color, this wine has aromas of cherry bubble gum, strawberry and herb. The palate has a full, creamy feel with flavors that linger. It's a broader style than often seen on rosés—more of a red wine feel—but it's hard to deny its appeal.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",88176
"77482","This vibrant Pinot Grigio opens with aromas of white flowers and white tree fruit. The round palate offers mature pear and green apple alongside bright acidity but the structure doesn't fully support the evident alcohol.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",77482
"90119","Quite light, suggesting fruit that was picked at less than optimal ripeness. This thin wine has tart red fruit, a streak of caraway seed and a finish with sweet cracker highlights.","Red","Red Blend","US",90119
"68750","A bit thin and rugged, but gets the red wine job done, with cherry, plum and black pepper flavors that finish dry.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",68750
"13398","Cola, forest floor and black fruit give this an almost ominous bouquet, but the wine is sweet, ripe and true. Extracted but rewarding, with lots of fruit, flavor and fun. Don't expect elegance but rather big fruit and generosity.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",13398
"101296","A dry, thin, modest Cabernet, the kind you drink in a paper cup at big parties. The host serves it, and you drink with the food.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101296
"25166","Adam Lee takes hold of one of the appellation's iconic vineyards and delivers clean, fresh aromas of mushrooms, raspberries, mocha and graphite. The palate shows soy, shiitake and more raspberry, an excellent study of the grape done in the Siduri style.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25166
"51606","A drop in alcohol by more than a full percent since the excellent 2009 Nysa was released suggests that this vintage did not achieve optimal ripeness. Bitter upon entry, with a medicinal note, this remains stiff and unyielding, with tart cranberry fruit and sharp acids.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51606
"105787","A line up of McGregor's 2010 and 2011 Pinot Noirs make a bold statement for Finger Lakes Pinot, but the regular label 2011 is drinking particularly well now. Lifted violet and berry notes are intoxicating on this spicy, deftly balanced wine. Rich, ripe black-cherry and raspberry flavors blend into a liquid silk on the palate, but are framed squarely by fine-grained tannins and a spray of cranberry acidity. The finish goes on and on. Likely to drink beautifully from now through at least 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105787
"77843","Weedy, herbal and strong-willed, this is a warm concentrated wine that's softly textured and moderate in structure. Extracted flavors of red cherry and vanilla accentuate the wine's succulent nature.","Red","Zinfandel","US",77843
"38064","Ever have a cherry cola? That's what this Pinot tastes like, along with toasty oak, the sweet heat of alcohol and peppery spices. It's a translucent ruby color, with a light, silky body. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",38064
"51456","All three grape varieties in this blend offer their own special contribution. The result is balance—a dry, smoothly tannic wine with lots of upfront berry, spice, leather and sandalwood notes.","Red","Red Blend","US",51456
"29631","A fascinatingly flavorful wine by South African Ernst Storm, this shows very perfumed apple peels, pungent green pears and telltale grass shavings on the nose, all lifted by white pepper, wet thyme and hints of dried peaches. The incredibly vibrant palate, with lots of energy and acidity yet not in a biting way, offers flavors of rainy cement, limestone, Granny Smith apple skins and more grass.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",29631
"46297","Watery pineapple and peach flavors have a heavy jacket of oak-like smokiness. Acidity provides a clean mouthfeel.","White","Chardonnay","US",46297
"98749","After starting out somewhat reduced, this becomes aromatic with notes of char, coffee grounds, toast, herbs and dark cherries. It's seamless, silky and rich in feel, with layered fruit and barrel flavors and a beguiling sense of texture.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",98749
"78500","Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",78500
"30834","This has flavors of pineapple, orange and buttered toast, with lots of brisk acidity. It offers the oaky creaminess that many Americans love.","White","Chardonnay","US",30834
"53619","A sweet succulence of white peach stars in this full-bodied, well-built and ripe wine. Plush on the palate, it rewards in a freshness of acidity that balances its richness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",53619
"77364","Right on the border of being a dessert wine, this unusual Pinot Gris has 2.8% residual sugar. It's betwixt and between—not really sweet enough for dessert, but too sweet for most other food. A simple sipping wine, perhaps?","White","Pinot Gris","US",77364
"4788","Popcorn, paint thinner and other oak-driven aromas control the nose on this resiny, woody wine. Like the nose, the flavor profile is barrel dominated. It finishes with resin, sawdust and bitter flavors.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",4788
"17389","The wine is subdued and clean on the nose and it doesn't exaggerate or mask the quality of fruit. This is executed in a bright, compact and streamlined style that combines freshness and firmness.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",17389
"42407","Always extremely popular, this Southern Rhône-style six-grape blend is especially noteworthy in 2011. It's a powerful wine that has a broad array of red and purple fruits, plus penetrating focus. This is juicy, forward and immediately delicious, and it also has the structure to age, perhaps surprisingly well.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",42407
"78279","Densely delicious, this is earthy in a forest floor kind of way—it's explosive in black cherry, plum and compelling, exotic spice. Medium bodied and lushly layered, it's persistent on the palate, brooding in ripe fruit yet buoyed by ample acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78279
"92617","This mature blend of Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells stalky and herbal, with stewed berry notes and a whiff of coffee grinds. The palate is raw and rubbing, while horsey berry flavors suggest underripeness. A soupy, stewy tasting finish feels chunky and obtuse.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",92617
"66373","Lots of toasted, smoky, coffee-like aromas and flavors coat the raspberry and tart blackberry core of this medium-bodied wine. It's a bit much in terms of oak, but makes a fun exercise, especially when paired with its sister wine made in American oak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66373
"50579","This opens with standard cherry and berry aromas before transitioning to a juicy palate with red berry, plum, herb and grass notes. It finishes a little hot and aggressive, but for $4 who's complaining?","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",50579
"17365","Darcie Kent really nails this Cab out of John Madden's Ranch. Pungently bold and moody, intensely herbal with green pepper and olive, wrapped within a wall of black pepper that lingers. Pair it with pepper steak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",17365
"55549","Made in a softer, gentler style, almost with the body of a Pinot Noir. But the flavors are intensely concentrated, suggesting blackberries, black currants, cola, mocha and pepper. It's an easy Zin to drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",55549
"50351","Faded yellowish pink in color, this bottling by vintner Richard Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca shows baking soda, squeezed lemon, sour raspberry and a touch of maraschino cherry on the nose. The palate offers lighter strokes of nectarine and chalky clay notes.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",50351
"24971","Ripe plum and berry aromas come with spice notes before a supremely generous palate that's loud and flavorful in blackberry, cassis and black cherry fruit. On the finish, chocolate and oak influences roll in as the tannins subside. For power, flavor and clarity, this is a sure bet.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",24971
"42555","This is a 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from Coombsville. It's dense with tannins, but they're very finely woven, and the wine has a gentle grace. The flavors of blackberries are pristine and ripe, and accompanied by a new oak smokiness. Good as it is now, it will develop bottle complexity after 2016.","Red","Red Blend","US",42555
"80633","Lush and forward, this lovely wine is bursting with red and black-cherry fruit. It socks you (gently) in the nose and seduces you in the mouth, with streaks of cola and a dash of pepper. No need to wait on this wine, as it is already drinking like a dream.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80633
"41857","This is a robust Sauvignon Blanc that announces itself with aromas of grass, spice and straw, leading into a combination of fresh fruit and earthy spice flavors. A great balance of acid, fruit and spice means it's assertive, but still poised. A fun wine with lots of character.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",41857
"72462","Generous flavors with a full body add up to a very likable, mouthfilling wine that will love a juicy steak or grilled lamb chop. Almost-sweet spices like vanilla and nutmeg come out in the aroma and persist through the fresh black cherry flavors and finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72462
"56856","A 50-50 blend of Merlot and Syrah, this easygoing wine opens with aromas of red currant, graphite and cracked peppercorn. The lively palate offers blackberries, blueberries and clove alongside tangy acidity and dusty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",56856
"5722","Ripe and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine has lots of butter and vanilla in the aromas, a flavor almost as rich as a vanilla milkshake, and a buttery texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",5722
"40074","Tastes dry, bitter and tannic, like press wine, with green, stemmy flavors of berries and green peppercorns. Drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",40074
"99908","Ripe aromas of peach, melon, apple and pineapple unfold on the nose of this wine, with additional hints of hay and flint that add an earthy streak. The light-weight palate shows a soft prickle of acidity that then fades quickly on the finish, feeling a touch flat. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",99908
"67220","Made in a fruit-forward way, with jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish in a swirl of chocolate and spices. It's a heartily tannic wine for drinking now. Good with slow-cooked meat stews and barbecue. Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","US",67220
"19708","Aromas of red fruit, cherry meat, herb and pencil lead are followed by full fruit flavors. It pulls up on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",19708
"5679","Gavin Chanin's take on this vineyard shows lots of dark but never heavy spice on the nose, with bergamot, white sage and damp eucalyptus forest complementing the raspberry fruit. The palate clings to a line of graphite minerality, with cooked raspberry torte and loamy earth flavors leading into a black-tea finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5679
"40666","Smashed pomegranate and raspberry aromas meet with underlying mocha, herbs and plum skins on this bottling. The palate's sour-plum flavor slides into turned loam and dried herb, which makes the wine complex but not quite delicious. A bit more time may smooth it out.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40666
"59228","This is adequately pungent on the nose, with a touch of the veggies. The palate is modest in acidity but not flat or flabbby. Flavors of green fruits mix with a hint of asparagus, while controlled capsicum and bitterness work the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",59228
"41485","From its inky black color, you can tell that this is a big wine, and one sip confirms that impression. This is dry, full bodied and tannic, with explosive blackberry and raisin flavors as well as an edge of crisped beef. It's a little rustic, and the sweet fruit suggests pairing it with barbecue and roasted meat.","Red","Red Blend","US",41485
"50422","A simple but easy-to-drink Chardonnay with soft aromas and flavors of ripe red apple and pear. Medium weight with a solid, clean finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",50422
"64156","This veteran winery, located alongside Highway 101, gets serious on its small-lot bottlings, here presenting eucalyptus, anise, baked cherry, plum skin, pencil lead and concentrated rose petal on the nose. Complex and deep, the palate is structured around cranberry-cherry brioche flavors that are decorated with herbs, from oregano and bay leaf to fennel pollen and anise seeds.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64156
"22117","Fiery and crisp, with decent berry and cherry aromas giving it character. The palate is medium to racy, with zesty raspberry, cherry and rhubarb flavors. Finishes short and a little prickly, with heat and a hint of chocolate. Very basic, but by no means a bad wine.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",22117
"38933","A simple Viognier. Shows the exotic richness of the variety, with tropical fruits, white flowers and peaches, as well as plenty of sweet oak. The finish is quick.","White","Viognier","US",38933
"85270","This vineyard, which dates back to 1978, ripened well in 2014. Scents and flavors emphasize fresh red berries, with a touch of stone. There's a firm grip to the tannins, a touch of black pepper, and everything is well-integrated, flavorful and ready to drink.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85270
"76742","Intensely ripe, almost raisinated in tone, this full-bodied Merlot offers loads of fleshy black-cherry and berry flavors. Yielding acidity accentuates its round lush mouthfeel but fine grippy tannins lend upright structure to the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",76742

"98660","Hailing from chilly Casablanca, this Syrah shows a soupy, vegetal smelling nose that's mildly green and earthy. The palate feels pretty good and chunky, but the flavor profile runs green, with an herbal finish.","Red","Syrah","Chile",98660
"78961","Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot come together to offer black currant and vanilla aromas in this dense Bolgheri red. The palate doles out ripe black plum and cedar-inflected tobacco flavors, set against fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",78961
"33505","You'll find tons of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, orange zest, chocolate and spice flavors in this dry wine, but it's no mere fruit store. With polished tannins and fine Carneros acidity, it achieves an elegant balance. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",33505
"74192","On the nose this is muted, but the palate is full of easy charm. Floral hints meet with ripe pear and that wonderfully leafy, ripe pungent pepperiness.

"20432","Lots of fresh apple and tangy white peach flavor make this light-bodied wine attractive and appetizing. The flavors have great focus, the balance is bright and the alcohol is low.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",20432
"95831","The plumpest of Frankland Estate's three single-vineyard bottlings in 2012, Netley Road offers subdued lime and tobacco aromas, then flavors of tangerine and pineapple. It's softer than the others, but displays an attractively chalky element to the textured finish. Drink now–2020.","White","Riesling","Australia",95831

"46019","This is tutti-frutti in scent, with a pear drop note that is loud and clear. It's light to medium in body, lacking some focus and concentration.","Rosé","Rosé","US",46019
"12688","In this dynamic wine, the nose shows purple acai berries, fennel shavings, tight graphite minerality and a hot cherry-pie warmth. Boysenberries give tart vibrancy to the fun and lively palate, which picks up richness from blackberry extract in the midpalate and dark chocolate elements on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",12688
"54242","Neutral aromas are clean but devoid of specific fruit scents. This is regular in feel, with a bit of chunky weight. Baked, earthy flavors of black fruits and cocoa lose steam on a finish that turns soft and a little sticky.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",54242

Drink from 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",47916
"88389","This is rooty and leafy on the nose, with dry raspberry and root beer aromas. There's a compost-like undercurrent to this wine that's highlighted via leafy, herbal flavors and a baked, earthy finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Mexico",88389
"33681","Made from 100% Chardonnay, this wine is marketed to celebrate wedding anniversaries. It's as light as a feather, with a fine, silky mousse framing orange, lime, vanilla, honey and yeasty sourdough flavors. Delicious and elegant, it's a wine to toast with almost anything, including wedding cake.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",33681
"54410","A dark, earthy take on Cabernet, without the obvious cassis character that often overtakes Australian Cabs. Instead, the aromas and flavors lean toward black olive and tobacco. Tannins are fully ripe and soft, making it easy to drink now, although there's enough tart acidity for balance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",54410
"32554","You can tell the age from the color and the faded mushroom flavors on the palate. It does merit some passing interest as a wine from the very hot 2003 vintage, but that's about all.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",32554
"24432","On the nose, aromas of russet apple and pear skin mingle with fresh citrus zest and a hint of ripe pear. The palate underlines the ripe fruit which is bedded in a soft but very fresh and concentrated core of savory yeast. Each layer shimmers with fruit, freshness and spice. The palate has a real dynamic energy and is lovely now but will be even lovelier in two or three years' time.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",24432
"23207","Here's a big, rich, lusty Zinfandel, the kind that packs plenty of flavor. It explodes in wild forest raspberry and blackberry fruit, accented with spicy thyme and chamomile tea, while extremely high alcohol gives it heat and a glyceriny sweetness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",23207
"80006","A little on the light side, but elegant, with wild cherry, cola and red currant flavors that finish dry and crisp in acidity. Earns extra plaudits for complexity and grace.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80006
"78206","If you like full-flavored, lusty Tempranillos, Viñas del Cenit in western Zamora is a reliable source. This has floral berry aromas, a saturated palate with wall to wall tannins, and baked black-fruit flavors that push up towards maximum ripeness. A staunch, jammy, tannic red made to with meat off the grill.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",78206

"39863","Packed with juicy berry flavors, this outgoing wine blends great freshness and pure grape flavors with a lip-smacking texture of tannins and acidity that keep it well balanced.

"16300","A light, elegant berry aroma transitions to notes of plum and blackberry with airing. Smooth and nice in terms of mouthfeel, it has balsamic-touched flavors of lightly stewed berry, earth and chocolate. This is a proper Rioja for near-term drinking.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",16300
"15978","Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",15978
"51240","Dried black cherries, a hint of purple flowers and a touch of tar show on the closed nose of this wine. The palate is also extremely wound up at this stage, with hints of espresso and dark chocolate. Although the structure is impressive, it does not allow much flavor to escape right now.","Red","Syrah","US",51240
"1334","Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",1334

"78045","The sonorous smoke and cinnamon-tinged tone of oak surrounds this wine. On the palate, there is a sumptuousness that marries well with the full red-cherry fruit of Zweigelt.

"62625","Pricy for Chilean SB, but clean, good and spunky, with citrus, nettle and bell pepper on the nose. The palate is wet, fresh and snappy, and the flavors exhibit grassiness along with tropical fruit and lime. Cleansing and crisp on the finish, and ready to drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",62625
"32185","This deftly hits on all cylinders, delivering big fruit, firm acid, fresh mineral and rich, toasty new-barrel highlights. Juicy, textural and deep, it's a wine to gulp, to savor and to share.","White","Chardonnay","US",32185
"34837","Dry and robust, this has tannins that scour, giving a rough edge to the blackberry fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",34837
"55986","Tightly woven tannins mark this blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Sangiovese and 9% Merlot. From there, it's a story of soft leather, black tar and rich, velvety blackberry, given 20 months in large French oak barrels. More time in bottle should help make friends of the disparate elements; drink through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","US",55986
"79091","Simple and robust, dry and full-bodied. A little on the thin side, but there are some decent sour cherry candy and red currant flavors.","Red","Merlot","US",79091
"90873","Somewhat flat on the palate, this full-bodied wine is ripe in blue fruit but shy in acidity.","Red","Syrah","US",90873

"85263","A toasty, smoky element to this concentrated wine balances with the rich apricot fruit and the mineral texture. Acidity and a citrus line cut through the generous, full flavors. The aftertaste shows the wine is still young. Wait to drink until 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",85263
"12101","From a winery that holds back its few hundred-case production each year comes a very promising Old World-styled wine grown in the rocky terroir of the Malibu Coast. Amidst its dark blueberry and crushed graphite scents are dried pasilla chile, nettle and pine hints. The palate shows similar savory and herbal touches, with green peppercorn accenting ripe red cherry and clove, all framed by firm tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",12101
"81764","This is an unassuming and easy red from the shores of Italy's beautiful Lake Garda that offers cherry fruit and loads of exotic spice. Its color is ruby red with bright highlights and it offers sour cherry flavors with some bitterness on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",81764
"88181","Lively, lip-smacking fruit flavors and a tangy, tannic texture will make this a great pairing with grilled chicken, steak or portobello mushrooms. Medium bodied and well balanced, it's fun to drink.","Red","Merlot","US",88181

Crisp acidity and a steely minerality fortunately provide balance. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",37320
"320","Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own.","Red","Zinfandel","US",320
"95917","The mouthfeel on this Merlot is all wrong. It's harsh and jagged in tannins, and raspingly dry. And the fruit is lacking. A real disappointment.","Red","Merlot","US",95917
"101784","Less effusive on the nose than the Mort's Block, this boasts notes of tangerine zest and lemon. This dry, medium-bodied Riesling hints at riper fruit flavors yet stays resolutely citrusy through the long, electric finish.","White","Riesling","Australia",101784
"63591","The fruit sources—Klipsun and Gamache—are excellently displayed in this white that includes 8% Sémillon. A bracing, cool blast of citrus, white peach, melon and cucumber is buoyed with crisp minerality. The wine spent seven months in 15% new French oak.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",63591

"13490","Dark, with a complex nose mixing very ripe, raisiny fruit with smoke and a hint of spoilage. The wine seems pushed just over the edge, losing focus and definition. The fruit quickly gives way to leaf and forest floor flavors in an herbal, earthy finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",13490

An energizing mineral note closes the lingering finish.","White","Riesling","Italy",24669
"76149","Coming from the great 2011 vintage, this is an impressive wine. It is rich, smooth and generous in the mouth. Dark dried fruits and acidity create a wine that is on the dry side of Ports. The tannins and acidity and the fact the wine is unfiltered mean it could age although ready now. Drink until 2030.","Port","Port","Portugal",76149
"549","While dry in style, this lithe, delicately framed Riesling packs a punch of ripe, rich tropical fruit. It's blossomy and buoyantly fruity, yet brashly mineral as well. Made using “virgin berries”, uniquely seedless grapes with a tendency towards exuberant aroma and flavor concentration.","White","Riesling","US",549
"73785","There's immediate appeal to this wine's plum and cocoa aromas, with Syrah (11%) adding game and smoke. The flavors are fruit-forward with plenty of plushness that make it hard to resist. It doesn't seem entirely varietally correct but after the second sip all that is forgotten.","Red","Merlot","US",73785
"89462","This is a brilliant wine that showcases Edna Valley's ability to produce some of the purest white-wine flavors in California. If there's any oak, it's not apparent at all. What you get are crisp, clean flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, peaches, vanilla, white pepper and herbs.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",89462

"94769","A creative, dry-farmed blend of 47% Grenache, 40% Petite Sirah and 13% Zinfandel, this bottling shows dense sagebrush, cedar, sandalwood, pine and black gravel on the dark, shrubby nose. The palate offers olallieberries with a woody twist of dried rosemary and oregano, as well as dried orange-rind tartness.","Red","Red Blend","US",94769

"97334","Rich fruit, layered with acidity, stars in a wine that is dense, very much a product of the powerful 2005 vintage. With the concentrated tannins, this is showing that it needs to age, but already the sweet fruits are opulent and soft.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",97334
"4745","Very light in the glass, this wine by regional Sauv Blanc veteran Kathy Joseph offers cut green apples, sweet lime blossoms and a light honey element on the nose. Lime zest and citrus pith decorate the palate, with steely white pepper and dried oregano flavors that race across the tense palate.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",4745
"71427","In addition to the blackberry base, minty herbs, leather and turned loam on the nose, this bottling offers a strong woody character, with cedar, sandalwood and pine needle aromas. The very dry black-currant fruit is awash in flavors of dill, savory black pepper and black olive. Tannins are sticky but not overly aggressive.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71427
"59360","Obviously young and still showing the brief wood aging, this is an attractive and juicy wine with ripe red berry fruits, spice from the wood and a soft texture. It should be ready to drink by 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",59360
"81518","This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020–2030.","Red","Grenache","Australia",81518

"62615","Saturated on the nose, this has aromas of pencil lead, coconut, vanilla and black fruit. It feels tannic, with pulsing acidity pushing raisin, prune, black plum, licorice and graphite flavors. The finish is oaky, resiny and chocolaty tasting.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",62615
"40811","This is a composed and lovely wine, light in body yet quite complex. The palate is integrated with flavors of ripe apple, lemon, melon and beeswax. Structured with a mere suggestion of oak, it'll stand up to bigger foods than most California Chenin, textured and good-naturedly creamy.","White","Chenin Blanc","US",40811
"105259","Underbrush, raisin, charred earth, mocha and toast aromas lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, chocolate, toasted oak, vanilla and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. It lacks fruit richness to stand up to the oak.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",105259
"57181","The aromas are light, with notes of herb, banana and underripe pineapple. The palate falls flat, drinking more like a generic white wine, with the concentration lacking.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",57181
"97330","The chilly vintage has given this Sauvignon Blanc an unripe edge. There are notes of gooseberries alongside the lemons and limes. The finish is dry, but honeyed, and brightened with crisp acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",97330
"100251","Starts off a little musty, so decant for a while, and this coastal mountain Merlot will open up to reveal mint-accented blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and clove flavors. It's rich and polished, but a little on the soft side. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",100251
"45919","Borra's Fusion is 90% Viognier and 10% Gewurztraminer and the two varieties bring out nice things in each other here, the floral aromas at the wine's opening evolving into a crisp, soft, creamy center on the mid-palate, a taste of citrus and honeydew standing out.","White","White Blend","US",45919
"5312","This doles out multiple layers of cinnamon, red cherry, vanilla, blackberry, espresso and tobacco flavors.

"105098","This Syrah is hard and tannic now, and it will always be hard and tannic, but it's quite an impressive wine. So dense and layered, it reveals tiers of complexity with every sip as it airs in the glass. The flavors are of pure, ripe wild blackberries, with currant, coffee and tobacco notes, and sprinkled with crushed black pepper. Drink now–2013.","Red","Syrah","US",105098

"2907","Bright aromas of raspberry, herb, cigar box and dried cranberry are followed by full-bodied cranberry and raspberry flavors. It delivers enjoyment but seems a bit dried out.","Red","Zinfandel","US",2907
"93001","Fragrant notes of white blossom and peach waft from this juicy off-dry Riesling. Creamy and luscious in texture, it offers concentrated tangerine and stone-fruit flavors balanced briskly with acidity. It's an uncomplicated but lip-smacking sip to enjoy now through 2018.","White","Riesling","Germany",93001
"47867","This full-bodied Zinfandel adds in 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, which is an unusual blend but works really well.

"30894","Sardasol has a good track record with rosé, and the 2007 is a clean wine with a light pink luster and brash cherry and raspberry aromas. The wine is incredibly fresh and zesty, with orange and nectarine flavors. Nothing is out of place on this perfectly good and sprightly example of Navarran rosado.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",30894
"26446","This Cabernet fits the steakhouse red formula to a T. Ripe, lusty fruit—blackberry in this case—is matched by a big whack of vanillin oak. It's not the most complex wine, but offers plenty of full-bodied, softly tannic flavor. Drink now–2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",26446
"62300","This dark concentrated Syrah is loaded with spicy black-fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is hard and tannic as well as fresh, racy and juicy. Spiced plum, cherry and blackened gritty flavors turn peppery on a tannic finish.","Red","Syrah","Chile",62300
"15093","This is a very closed, terroir-driven wine with a mineral character. With its tight structure and flavors of green fruit and spice, it is a wine for aging. Screwcap.","White","Riesling","Austria",15093
"2521","This three-acre parcel has produced a beautiful fruity wine. With red cherry and spice flavors, the wine is perfumed and juicy. Crisp acidity shoots through the attractive fruit to give a wine that is only lightly tannic and ready to drink.","Red","Gamay","France",2521
"93027","From a 34-acre property that has vines both in Blaye and Bourg, this is concentrated, showing the ripe, generous fruit of the vintage. Still youthful, its blackberry juiciness lies behind its wood-aging flavors. Drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",93027
"20774","Here's a fancy Pinot Noir from a great appellation. With a silky texture and modest alcohol, it shows a ripe balance rare in California. Impresses for its array of cherries, raspberries, cola and sweet sandalwood. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20774
"62854","Creamy notes of strawberry shortcake make for an alluring nose. The impression continues on the palate with very fine creamy mousse while the more tender, tart red-berry notes now gain some enticing pepper spice. This is a very elegant, dry apéritif style. Without any dosage the finish is long, refreshing and dry.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","France",62854
"27260","The wine is so fresh, bright and crisp. It has great acidity that comes from the lively red berry fruits. The tangy aftertaste and breezy acidity make this a great apéritif style for the summer.","Rosé","Rosé","France",27260
"69826","Firm and focused, this lightly spiced effort supports its tart cherry fruit with ample acidity. Hints of toasted coconut build in the finish. A few more years of bottle age should bring further integration.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69826
"93964","Opening with a clean-cut scent of ripe green pears this has refreshing, lemony zip in a rounded, soft body.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",93964
"49937","Strong now in fruity flavor and oak, with potent mountain tannins, this tiny-production Cab wants some time to knit together. It's rich and extracted in blackberry tart with the sweet smoky crust, black currant jam, blueberry, dark chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that finish in a complex swirl of dusty spices. Try after 2013.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",49937
"17497","I can see why so many of Washington's winemakers love this young vineyard. It is already expressing the sort of subtleties that most viticulturalists would kill for. The fruit is ripe but not too sweet or jammy. It is annotated with citrus, leaf and stem, along with streaks of smoke and herb and mineral. It's all mixed together seamlessly and focused into a firm, almost muscular style with real authority.","Red","Syrah","US",17497
"43955","A fine example of Styria's signature wine style, this Sauvignon Blanc has enticing herbaceous aromas followed by rich, full green plums, white currants and a layer of sweet, full acidity. Glass stopper.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",43955
"106230","Familiar aromas of plum, mulberry, clove and slate show on the nose of this appellation blend by the Paso Robles-based winery. There is decent tension on the sip, where cooked cranberry and strawberry meet with a backbone of allspice and nutmeg as well as bittersweet chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",106230
"44707","Rich in jammy cherry and chocolate flavors, and with finely ground, ripe tannins, this Merlot hails from an inland Sonoma County appellation. The wine is a little simple, but is elegant and very easy to drink.","Red","Merlot","US",44707
"58548","Here's a fragrant and delicate Chardonnay from the far north of Italy that delivers aromas of honeysuckle, passion fruit and almond skin. The wine has fresh appeal and zesty spice on the close that makes it a natural companion to fish and vegetable dishes.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",58548
"72309","Tart and tight, this young wine is still pulling itself together. The tart raspberry fruit turns quite sour, with a streak of Band-aid, then an unintegrated wash of caramel.","Red","Barbera","US",72309
"64990","This rich blend gets its ripe texture and warm pear and citrus flavors from 50% Sémillon. It has an attractive perfumed edge, with kiwi-like acidity and a peppery aftertaste. Drink from 2018.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",64990
"71231","Still young, raw and a bit oaky, this well-balanced wine just needs some more time to smooth itself out. All the right elements are there, from the polished fruit to the tangy acids to the toasty oak (slightly more than half is barrel fermented). This is a firm, fruity style, well-made and lively. Best Buy.","White","Chardonnay","US",71231
"933","This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",933
"52876","This cheerful 60-40 blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc offers pristine aromas of white flower, honeysuckle, peach blossom and a touch of crushed white pepper. The wine is smooth and silky on the close and shows a sunny Tuscan personality.","White","White Blend","Italy",52876
"6037","This Syrah emphasizes herb and spice, keeping the peppery fruit in the background. Nice grip and a pleasing texture contribute to the enjoyment, though the light, grapy flavors make you wonder how well the wine will age.","Red","Syrah","US",6037
"77582","Very fresh and very fruity, this wine gushes blueberry aromas and dark cherry flavors in a fun way that makes it easy to sip or even gulp. It's light on tannins and acidity, so it feels smooth but has a slightly gripping texture.","Red","Red Blend","US",77582
"8193","In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel. This offering shows crisp, refreshing acidity to balance its residual sugar and classic flavors of green apple, lime and pineapple. Under it all is a firm foundation of slate-driven minerality and a fine, linear structure.","White","Riesling","Germany",8193
"40557","With its rich chocolate and spice flavors, this rolls around the mouth like velvet, its fruit so well-integrated with the wood and the vanilla that it is seamless. A delicious wine that deserves 3–4 years aging.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",40557
"50870","Aromas of banana, mango, and pineapple open to flavors of tropical fruit salad, mango and banana and a soft finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Romania",50870
"39200","Morellino di Scansano is an up-and-coming red wine from Southern Tuscany that is easy and fun to drink. This ruby-colored expression delivers fresh tones of cherry and red currants and it has a soothing, soft texture in the mouth thanks to one year of oak aging.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",39200
"87424","Starting off quite reductive, it opens to reveal notes of lime leaf, mineral and freshly peeled tangerine. The palate drinks dry but doesn't have the acid to entirely stand it up.","White","Riesling","US",87424
"43326","This Beaune bottling has a dense structure that broods through its tannic outer skin. Perfumed red fruits will shortly burst out to give an opulent, rich wine with both great acidity and layers of spice that finish with freshness. Drink from 2021.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",43326
"67206","An interesting and complex Chard marked by intense minerality. Calls to mind Chablis in the acidity, dryness and racy taste of cold steel. Also in the flavor mix are tart green apples, pineapples, limes, cinnamon spice and creamy lees.","White","Chardonnay","US",67206
"87140","Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87140
"88986","A tart, cranberry- and raspberry-flavored wine, this young, high-acid style of Pinot has a charming, Burgundian feeling to it. The snappy red fruits are underscored with citrus, and the balance is disarmingly light, but not simple or dull.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88986
"13131","Earthy, rustic aromas of tree bark and herbal berry fruits set up a fresh, fairly aggressive palate. Simple berry flavors are backed by chocolate and oaky char, while the finish is peppery and feels a bit hot.","Red","Malbec","Chile",13131
"26656","This blend of 70% Syrah, 10% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese delivers vanilla, shaved coconut and dark fruit aromas. It's full bodied, with fruit and barrel-derived flavors that linger on the finish. The oak influence is cumbersome.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",26656
"8025","Vivid aromas of tart cherry and cranberry are followed by equally vivid, crisp and tangy flavors that echo the cherry and cranberry but add richer plum notes and nuances of cinnamon, nutmeg and cedar. This is so well balanced and bright that it tastes lip-smacking delicious now but will improve with age through at least 2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8025
"85578","Coming from the plateau above the river Douro, this wine has a cool edge with plenty of acidity. At the same time it is ripe with spice from 12 months of wood aging and full of black-currant fruitiness. Drink this wine now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",85578
"56565","Delicious and delicate in structure and tannins, with a classic, silky mouthfeel that caresses the palate. Red and black cherry, raspberry, tangerine peel, cola, sweet rhubard, rose hip tea and oaky notes of smoke and vanilla contribute intricate detail.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56565
"102817","It drinks bigger than the listed 14% alcohol, but remains all in proportion. Tangy cherry and plum fruit flavors are wrapped in spice, cinnamon especially. A coffee scent carries through on the palate, infusing the finish.","Red","Malbec","US",102817
"103848","The aromas and flavors of new wood are dominant in this soft, ripe wine. It has opulent black-plum fruit that shows through the wood influence. A touch of smokiness adds spice.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",103848
"18660","Bortolin's Extra Dry Prosecco delivers sharp effervescence and soda-like tones of lemon, lime and white stone. In the mouth, however, the wine is creamy and soft thanks to its foamy bubbles.","Sparkling","Prosecco","Italy",18660
"29303","A fine Merlot, showing the softness and elegant drinkability of the variety. It's ripe and forward in cherries, cola and sweet oak. The addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah gives it extra tannic depth and body. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",29303
"13253","Compost, earth and spicy cardamom notes provide the savory intrigue of this full-bodied, expressive wine, with additional pine forest, pomegranate and orange peel flavors that add to its complexity and appeal. Sourced from several vineyards in the heart of the appellation, it represents the vintage and the location well.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",13253
"97360","Crisp and fresh aromas of lime sorbet and iced apple flesh greet the nose on this Riboli family bottling. The palate is steely and bright, with Anjou pear flesh, a bit of smoke and some red-apple ripeness.","White","Chardonnay","US",97360
"90138","This savory, straightforward red opens with attractive aromas of ripe plum, blue flower and a hint of baking spice. The juicy, easygoing palate includes ripe blackberry, spiced blueberry, star anise and a peppery note alongside round, velvety tannins. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",90138
"40131","Very fruity, very juicy, this wine is all about crisp, fresh fruitiness, starting with hand-picked biodynamic vineyard plots and gravity-flow into the winery. Red currants dominate, with considerable acidity right at the fore. At the back, the tannins are developing, but fruit will be the hallmark for the long future. Owner Thierry Valette's family also owns Château Troplong-Mondot in Saint-Émilion.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",40131
"22086","Ripe tangerine and green melon aromas take a zesty, herbal turn on the palate in this beautifully transparent dry Riesling. Its brisk acidity and cutting minerality lend a nervous edge that should ease with time, amplifying complexity and weight. Hold until 2020, but it should drink well for at least another decade beyond that.","White","Riesling","Germany",22086
"7884","This blend of 70% Roussanne and 30% Viognier from one of the young appellation's newer vineyards is a white Rhône done right, balancing restraint with ripeness. Aromas of beeswax, daffodil, yellow rose and ambrosia melon rind lead into a fresh, tightly wound palate of lemon mousse, yellow apple skins and cherimoya, all framed by a chalky grip.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",7884
"13642","Wound tightly, this burly, brawny bruiser comes out of its shell slowly to reveal soft, perfumy notes of violet and blueberry. Flavors of dark chocolate and jam sit atop powerfully rich, dense pockets of leather and black pepper. Drink now through 2023.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",13642
"98925","With vines forming part of the 22-acre Jessiaume estate, this vineyard—one of the better known of the Beaune premiers crus—has produced a fine, rich wine in this vintage. Although there is plenty of young wood, the fruit is so rich and generous, with such fine potential. Give this opulent wine until 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",98925
"25656","With soft acidity, this is already an attractive, warmly white wine. Orange and tangy citrus flavors are balanced by a light touch of wood aging that gives spice. It needs a few more months, so drink from the end of 2014.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",25656
"76721","Stone fruit, mature yellow apple, toasted oak and honey aromas come together in the glass. The round palate offers juicy pineapple, baked peach, lemon pastry and a mineral note alongside fresh acidity. It closes on a note of toasted almond.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",76721
"62806","Herbal in tobacco leaf and cedar, this is a medium-bodied, restrained and elegant wine, structured in robust tannin and mouthfeel with plenty of underlying acidity to keep it fresh and food-friendly.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62806
"55141","Montepulciano, Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes team up to produce this firmly structured but accessible red. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, red currants and tobacco lightly accented with oak-driven spice. It's balanced with firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",55141
"68985","Red berry aromas and cherry and candied fruit are backed by spice, horsehide and tobacco. The mouthfeel is thinner, streamlined and still a bit raw.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",68985
"33469","There's a dullness to this wine, which flirts with the idea of plum and cherry flavor yet gets somewhat bogged down in marshmallow. Light bodied, it presents with more ripe sweetness than it may actually have.","Red","Merlot","US",33469
"103263","Excellent Pinot, not just for its exquisite flavors but for the layers of complexity. Has everything you look for in California Pinot, tons of berry-cherry, earth, tobacco and spicy herb flavors and a silky texture that caresses the palate. Young and fruity now, this fine wine will develop additional nuances with age. Cellar Selection.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103263
"50247","Leafy notes give way to the barest hint of nail polish remover. The palate is dilute with dried-up red fruit flavors that quickly fade away leaving only bracing tannins and evident alcohol. It closes on a bitter note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",50247
"86304","Primary flavors of luscious cherry, berry and plum reverberate throughout this fleshy red blend. Sunny acidity and a silken rounded mouthfeel lend to a juicy and easy-drinking demeanor. Fine but persistent tannins lend structure to a vanilla-spiced finish. Drink now through 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",86304
"34981","Concentrated and powerfully structured now, this will benefit from some time to integrate and harmonize. Currently, all of the elements are assertively upfront, with strong oaky sensations, dense and ripe black-fruit notes and firm tannins all vying for your attention. Hints of leather, bramble, licorice root and roasted cocoa nib hang in the background, waiting for their moment to shine. Try after 2016, and through 2020.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",34981
"75347","A standard Pinot Noir, soft and extracted in cherry and raspberry pie filling. It has a nice, silky texture and good acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75347
"89676","Though handsomely balanced, this medium-weight Chardonnay shows only modest complexity, with apple, tropical fruit and mild toasty notes on the nose and palate. A slight caramel note gives a vaguely sweet cast to the basically dry fruit flavors. Has appeal and some length, but it's not the statement one would expect at the price. —M.M.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",89676
"54800","Quite youthful for its advanced age, this bottling shows crushed herbs, ground coffee, dense blueberries, leathery smoked meats and tobacco on the nose. The palate conveys tangy boysenberries with black pepper and crushed herbs, laid across a smooth tannic structure.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",54800
"74451","From a vineyard that overlooks the wild Marin Coast, with plenty of Pacific Ocean fog, this is an earthy, cool-climate and beguiling wine, speckled in clove, cinnamon and a brightness of wild cherry, raspberry and orange peel. Light and refined, its finish is dusted in pine leaves.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",74451
"33436","A mix of fruit spanning across the Russian River Valley, this complex Chardonnay is so inviting and approachable. Brimming in ripe Gravenstein apple and baking spices, it conveys alluring and lush crispness as well as balanced fruit and floral aromas.","White","Chardonnay","US",33436
"43910","This power-packed wine leads with aromas of raspberries, blackberries, dark chocolate and herbs. The dark fruit flavors are high octane, showing some warmth on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",43910
"99388","This is a serious Merlot, a welcome relief from the sea of mediocrity that masquerades under the variety. Grown in the winery's estate vineyard in the southerly Coombville area, the wine shows similarities to Carneros Merlots. Dry, fairly tannic, with crisp acidity and an earthy grounding, it has supple, refined flavors of black cherries, currants, cocoa, violets and cedar.","Red","Merlot","US",99388
"17736","A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",17736
"90670","Morello cherry is the central note here—almost candied but wonderfully ripe—with a juicy, almost bouncy body of fruity freshness. The acidity is bright but buffered by plenty of fruit. This is huge fun to drink, with or without food.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",90670
"41180","The nose conjures feral notes of skunk. A rich, syrupy palate tastes complicated and uneasy. Flavors of brown sugar and herbal black cherry are confusing, while the finish is herbal, earthy and green.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",41180
"89481","There's a raisin skin bitterness and some raisiny, Port-like flavors to this Cabernet Franc, suggesting some of the grapes were roasted on the vine. Other than that, it's softly tannic and savory, with cherry pie and oak notes.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",89481
"21917","The trick with sparkling wine is to achieve finesse. This Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blend is too scoury in bubbles, giving it a rough feel. Nonetheless it's delicious and easy to like for its yeasty flavors of limes, oranges and vanilla honey.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",21917
"7178","Earthy notes of clay and mushroom lend a rugged complexity to aromas of roasted plums and cherries on this lush yet composed wine. The palate is densely concentrated with black cherry flavor, but anchored with bright acidity and a blanket of velvet tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",7178
"66779","Delicate but enticing scents of white spring flower and pear waft out of the glass. On the refreshing palate, vibrant acidity and small continuous beads underscore yellow apple, lemon zest and a hint of white pear.","White","Glera","Italy",66779
"16668","Joseph Jewell's 2014s from remote Humboldt County are dazzling. The color off this wine is on the light side, and so are the raspberry, tea leaf and cinnamon flavors, but they make for a pleasant, harmonious combination. Medium body, vibrant acidity and firm but light tannins add to its appetizing character.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",16668
"30896","There is a fine combination of lightness and richness in this wine. The lightness comes from its fresh, crisp green flavors. The richness comes from the concentration, the flavor going deep down into the taut palate, acidity, mouth-filling green plums and spice. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",30896
"88898","Snappy grapefruit and tangerine aromas are clean and crisp. That also describes the palate on this Maule Valley SB. Fairly intense flavors of lemon-lime and grapefruit cruise across a racy, unbroken finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",88898
"447","Welcoming aromas of wood spice, plum and blackberry become more smoky with airing. This strong-boned RDD is pure and deep, with manageable tannins. Generous flavors of spiced blackberry, tobacco and vanilla finish long, elegant and with a lot in reserve. Drink from 2017 through 2030.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",447
"32778","Very light, elegant, fresh wine, crisp in the extreme, deliciously perfumed with its white flower aromas and hedgerow fruits. There is a green element here, shown in the fruit skin structure, which ends with an aftertaste of fresh, piercing acidity. Screwcap.","White","Riesling","Austria",32778
"76477","This is a sharp, grassy Pinot Gris, which does more than a gentle bow in the direction of Sauvignon Blanc. Herbaceous, peppery and penetrating, it's green and acidic, yet flavorful and a resonant food wine also.","White","Pinot Gris","US",76477
"8240","A strong, smoky set of aromas gets this going in the proper direction. There's also spice, earth, herbal aromas and leather to give it variety. The palate is deep and big, with blackberry, smoked meat and richness. Smooth on the finish, with black olive and additional herbal accents.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",8240
"97270","This is a 100% varietal wine, aged for 32 months, with one-quarter of the barrels being new oak. Grippy in red currant and cranberry, it has a thickness of tannin and slightly bittersweet, tobacco-like finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",97270
"22347","Firm and structured, this is a solid wine, laced with mineral acidity and tight tannins. It has a juicy, blackberry fruit component cutting through the texture. Drink this still young wine from 2014.","Red","Malbec","France",22347
"12792","This nose is a lovely mix of lemon peel and camphor leaves, intriguing and refreshing and just a little heady. The palate is streamlined and slender and of great purity. This is lithe but intense, slender but profound. It shows what Riesling is capable of in a cooler year. Stockpile this since it will last and get ever more delicious. Drink now till 2020.","White","Riesling","Austria",12792
"105378","This is the second label for Col Solare, the Ste. Michelle/Antinori collaboration on Red Mountain. A fine bottle for the price, it shows the same elegance and supple texture as the frontline wine. Black cherry, blueberry, mocha and smoke swirl over and around the palate. Only in the finish does it seem to fade quickly, with a very slight suggestion of glue in the aftertaste.","Red","Red Blend","US",105378
"27462","The Boushey character shines through in this elegant, complex wine. A lovely, sensual mix of loam, mushroom, tobacco and black cherry blends into a stylish wine with exceptional detail all the way through its lengthy finish.","Red","Syrah","US",27462
"78382","This is a simple rosé that could withstand some concentration. It was crafted from barrel-fermented Pinot Noir, and it shows very light flavors of watermelon and strawberry.","Rosé","Rosé","US",78382
"90454","New oak and ripe fruit combine to produce a user-friendly Chardonnay that's made in the popular style. It's enormous in pineapple, orange, mango and vanilla flavors that are brightened by crisp Carneros acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",90454
"51167","The most Burgundian of the '99s from Hartford, this cool-climate single-vineyard wine smells of leather, clove, even slightly of barnyard. Some green herbaceousness on the palate balances bright cherry fruit—the interplay of elements gives this wine a multifaceted character that changes from sip to sip. Give it 2–3 years for the tannins to smooth out. Cellar Selection.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51167
"85504","An astonishing wine, this showchases mature Riesling flavors with abundant fruit, a classic petrol character, and a strong, steely texture. It's structured with tight texture and intense acidity that lingers on the finish. Drink now.","White","Riesling","France",85504
"89981","Frizzante is the perfect term to describe this nervy, invigorating sparkling wine made from an unusual blend of Pinot Noir, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Exotically perfumed from nose to finish with touches of orange blossom and spice, it's a delicately pétillant wine with juicy peach and yellow-cherry flavors.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",89981
"14987","Ripe and extracted, this wine has cherry tart and Dr. Pepper flavors. The mouthfeel is light-bodied and silky, with bright acidity. It finishes a bit sweet in caramelized oak, and it seems ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14987
"83809","A Loire-like red wine, pleasantly light and fruity, it has black cherry and cola flavors and a real streak of earthiness. Dry, supple tannins provide structure, but it's pretty soft. From Beaucanon.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",83809
"53477","A combination of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this vineyard's lineage traces back in stages. The core six acres of Zinfandel was planted before 1892, the other acreage much more recently. Still, the wine retains an old soul of leather, tobacco and baking spice, wrapped around a ham-fisted swath of toasted oak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",53477
"8562","Young, spicy and forward, this immediately accessible wine is a bowl of cherry candy, backed with pineapple highlights from natural acidity. It's full in the mouth, still with primary fruit flavors, but the structure to age gracefully over the next five to eight years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8562
"21033","This is one of those wines that seems to get better by the sip. At first glance, the fruit seems a bit cooked or pruny, but within a few minutes it brightens and turns livelier, coming across as cherry. There's a mushroomy or meaty note as well—something akin to venison—and a rich texture on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",21033
"32358","Shows a lovely Pinot Noir texture, feeling silky smooth and light in the mouth, with a nice scour of acidity. The raspberry and cola flavors are a little simple, but tasty.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32358
"47032","This forward Amarone reflects the heat of the vintage. It has somewhat evolved aromas of leather and prune, accompanied by rich black fruit flavors and soft acidity. The tannins are starting to fade, so enjoy now and over the next few years.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",47032
"87548","Ripe plum and violet aromas carry a slight note of prune. A beefy palate shows hard tannins but nothing too tough that food can't tame. Blackened, roasted blackberry and blueberry flavors finish with charred, meaty intensity. Drink through 2020.","Red","Mencía","Spain",87548
"59470","Ripe and juicy, this is a fresh-faced wine with acidity and balanced tannins adding to the smoky aromas. It has the acidity typical of the vintage alongside the bright red-berry fruits. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",59470
"17477","From vineyards on Howell Mountain and Oak Knoll, this wine is bristling in acidity, with a taste of lemon peel and grapefruit. Secondary characteristics of peas and pineapple confound as a stony texture adds breadth.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",17477
"88386","This complex Chardonnay shows lots of smoky-sweet oak, with notes of buttered toast that are perfectly integrated with flavors of Asian pear, tropical fruits and spices. There's a wonderfully pure minerality that, together with brisk acidity, gives the wine a bracing quality.","White","Chardonnay","US",88386
"906","With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",906
"88577","Spicy and fruity, this is a lightweight, attractive and smooth wine. It has some undergrowth aromas, followed by red berry fruits, with fresh acidity at the end. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",88577
"30988","Among the better '98s, this wine's vineyard pedigree shows in the polished fruit and supple tannins, the result of great terroir. The aromas suggest black cherries and blackberries with intense oaky, smoky tones. Particularly notable for the soft, lush mouthfeel, like sipping pure velvet. If the wine were more concentrated it would be classic.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",30988
"91803","A mix of melon, tropical fruit and passion fruit aromas lead to a tight palate with just enough body weight to not be austere. Flavors of white pepper, citrus and celery are modest on the finish, which tastes briny.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",91803
"5012","Wrapped in an ethereal texture, this straightforward wine offers savory cranberry, strawberry and rhubarb around earth and spice. Medium bodied and robust, it finishes smooth and clean.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5012
"70007","An interesting Zin that attracts for its range of sweet fruit and dried herb flavors. The cherries, blackberries and raspberries have complex interweavings of thyme and lavender, leaving the palate to discover new sensations with every sip. Finishes dry and smoothly tannic.","Red","Zinfandel","US",70007
"44145","Soft and smooth, this is a ripe and creamy wine. It has light acidity, pineapple and apricot flavors and a rounded aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",44145
"70990","This is produced from 25-year-old vines in the Chambertin Grand Cru vineyard. It is a smoky, structured wine with layers of dark fruits and ripe tannins, with the fresh acidity of the year. Lots of attractive fruit is surrounded by the firm tannins and dry aftertaste. It should not be drunk before 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",70990
"97544","Aromatically this wine is not yet entirely ready to reveal its charms, with reserved notes of mineral, smoked meat, olive brine, fire pit, peat and crushed flowers. The generous earth and savory flavors feel rich and full, leading to a lengthy finish.","Red","Syrah","US",97544
"55746","The first Pinot Noir release from this producer, this is a velvety-smooth, exotic and charming wine, light on the palate despite a concentration of ripe, rich fruit. Kirsch, cherry, raspberry and cinnamon combine to make the wine invitingly lush and plush.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55746
"2331","Aromas of charred earth, overripe plum, game and a confectionary note lead the nose of this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo-Mammolo. The simple, rather rustic palate offers dried black cherry, leather and a hint of clove alongside dusty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",2331
"48589","Coming from a warm site in a cool vintage, it's an intriguing wine with notes of freshly cut hay, peach and mango.  It's lighter in style, with the partial malolactic fermentation (60%) providing extra weight and feel.","White","Chardonnay","US",48589
"5945","With just a handful of Malbec, this wine takes time to open before becoming juicy, herbal and elegant, expressive in tobacco and black tea. The tannins fine and dry.","Red","Merlot","US",5945
"25919","Lusty and strong, this is Lodi Zinfandel at its most classic. It's a big, thick, softly ripe wine that floods the mouth with exuberant flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants and peppery spices. Easy to like. Drink now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",25919
"24122","The aromas of vanilla, herb and cherry show some volatility. The cherry flavors are light, finishing tart.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",24122
"10513","Delicate scents of wild berry and fragrant blue flower float out of the glass. The refined, easy-drinking palate doles out succulent black cherry, licorice and a coffee note while polished tannins provide lithe support.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",10513
"100632","Some tasters will really love this Walla Walla Valley Syrah for its massive flavors of liquorous coffee and vanilla. A cookie dough baking spice flavor abounds, but at the moment, the fruit seems hidden. Perhaps it just needs more bottle age to balance itself out—time will tell.","Red","Syrah","US",100632
"97507","Lovingston's medium-bodied Bordeaux Blend is pleasantly grapy on the nose with an undertone of darkly toasted oak, nuts and savory spices. The palate holds a decent amount of black fruit, but with a green, underripe vein and fairly high level of acidity and tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",97507
"88581","Soft and rather simple, it conveys raspberry jam, cola, sweetened herb tea and smoky oak flavors. It's an easy Pinot to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88581
"840","The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.","Red","Grenache","US",840
"34324","This barrique-aged, 100% Merlot opens with aromas of roasted coffee bean, vanilla, coconut and plum steeped in spirits. The palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, licorice and oak extract alongside drying tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up so enjoy sooner rather than later. Drink through 2016.","Red","Merlot","Italy",34324
"49207","This is a rounded smooth wine. It does have a crisp edge of red currants and acidity but the main flavor comes from the ripe red-berry fruits and touch of caramel. Drink the wine now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",49207
"96599","Aromas of dust and stewed plums give a pleasing entry, but once sipped the wine tastes like it needs more time to mature. The flavors approach strawberry and other red fruits, but remain quite tart and tannic.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96599
"78355","Combining 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, this wine has a depth of richness and focused, supportive acidity that work well to complement each other. Stone fruit, vanilla biscuit, cherry kirsch and green apple are all within the spectrum of flavors here, finishing with grace and a hint of spice.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",78355
"42832","A bizarre interpretation of this vineyard, which usually produces magnificent wines. This Zin is soft and melted, lacking supportive structure, and it's as sweet as a raspberry and sugar confection.","Red","Zinfandel","US",42832
"40688","From organically grown estate grapes, all of them Hanzell clone, this Pinot is light, earthy and elegant in its herbal composition and soft body. While approachable now, it has enough structure to last through 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40688
"63249","There is a mere hint of fresh grapefruit on the nose but the palate follows with rounded, fresh but spice-edged mirabelle plums and more gentle citrus. There also are glimpses of fragrant citrus foliage with white pepper breaking through. This is ripe but light, rounded but delicate. A wonderfully zesty lemony finish just lasts and lasts.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",63249
"42287","A firmly tannic wine with a powerful structure, this is rich and well concentrated, with a solid character that supports the generous black fruits. Juicy and with good acidity at the end, the wine will be ready to drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",42287
"88509","This Nebbiolo is at first closed down and inexpressive. It eventually reveals subdued aromas of black cherry and raspberry with a whiff of spice that all carry over to the palate.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",88509
"7527","This feels rustic in the mouth, with edgy tannins and a streak of green mint. Still, it's dry and silky, with enough raspberry and cherry fruit to satisfy.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7527
"16785","Oak, peach and nutty aromas ride on the nose. Dense, creamy and reasonably balanced on the palate, this chunky number offers full melon and peach flavors prior to a briny, long finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",16785
"12966","Strawberry syrup, scarlet-red rose petals, warm licorice-laced cookies and dried sage combine for a brilliant nose from this reliably exciting vineyard, planted by a longtime cattle ranching family. Flavors of raspberry torte and ripe red fruits float across the palate, with added complexity from lifting mint and lively yeast elements.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",12966
"97143","Young, tight and sharp-toned upon first sniff, this broadens out and opens up with an hour or two of airing. The pinpoint focus brings black raspberry, black cherry and light hints of tobacco into play. The 30% new oak seems just right, although there is some burn in the finish from the high alcohol.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",97143
"33177","The oak is strong on this blend of three of the winery's best vineyards. It shows up as buttered toast, with a distinctive, charry-sweet note of toasted marshmallows. The wine is strong in pineapples and oranges. An eccentric Chardonnay for drinking now.","White","Chardonnay","US",33177
"94927","Ripe, sweet-smelling and “muy moderno,” but by no means is this Syrah-led warrior only fruit, bulk and oak. Spanish wine writer Victor de la Serna's wine gets better all the time. This vintage is like berry cake in a glass, but it's not short on anything, including acidity and tannic structure. Expect a blast of fruit flavor, intensity in reserve, and some forward oak, vanilla and butter. Should settle into form over the next 18 months.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",94927
"29541","Incredibly rich and delicious aromas of vanilla, scotch, blackberry jam, strawberry preserves and cola get a dash of added intrigue from the green hint of pasilla chile. The palate shows dark chocolate and blueberry-boysenberry juice, proving very rich but not overly dense in mouthfeel.","Red","Merlot","US",29541
"18090","All of the parts haven't yet come together: The oak, acidity, fruit and tannins hover around, but they're not quite completely harmonious yet. Still, it's very rich, with a massive black-cherry core. It seems to have all the components for a little time in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18090
"69041","A tender but perfumed hint of honeysuckle appears first on the nose, followed by rich peach hints. These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness. You can feel the warmth on the medium-sweet finish. This is full on and rich, almost unctuous—perfect for blue cheeses.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",69041
"7595","This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",7595
"55359","This cherry pink rosé is a mix of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, and offers plenty of pretty strawberry and cherry candied fruit. There's a sense of cotton candy also, as it wraps into the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",55359
"50610","With hints of minerality typical of any wine from the Dão, this has tight, yeasty notes that contrast with its crisp, bright apple fruit. Drink now.","Sparkling","Portuguese Sparkling","Portugal",50610
"80913","This is an unusual blend of principally Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo and Souzao, along with bits of Petit Verdot, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of cocoa, vanilla and green herb lead to tart cherry flavors that seem underripe. The finish comes up short.","Red","Red Blend","US",80913
"60719","Unctuously honeyed and floral, this is an irressistably pretty auslese that's sweet with peach and pear nectar, but vibrant, almost searing, with citrus acidity. It's not the most complex in style, but it's appealing for its decadent style and lingering sugar-laced finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",60719
"96052","Very dry, crisp and elegantly structured, this Pinot Noir can be had at a pretty good price. It has modest flavors of cherries, tobacco and spices, but is a little unripe, with hints of green tomato and white pepper.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96052
"71323","The nose is full of baking spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as blackberry and black currant, with a peppery note lingering under it all. The tannins are taut, with ample acidity lifting the spicy palate. Fruit notes of black plum and black currant meld with raw tobacco leaf. The tannins linger on the finish, with plenty of dark fruit and spice.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",71323
"55421","This wine offers aromas of herbs, black cherry and spice, showing a bit of heat. The dark-fruit flavors have good intensity, with dry, astringent tannins backing them up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",55421
"30814","A deep, concentrated, impressive wine that works on many levels. There are the blackberry fruits, almost jammy, that are enhanced by the tobacco and new wood flavors. Then there is the strong, underlying dryness that promises considerable aging. And there is the elegance. A smooth wine whose tannins work around the core of structure and style.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",30814
"43113","Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves. Stunning and gorgeous now in its youth, this collectible wine will reward at least through 2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43113
"90973","Smoked red-cherry and pomegranate-juice aromas show on the sip of this appellation blend. The palate shows fruit punch with touches of lavender and vanilla, which tastes good altogether, even though it is not very complex.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90973
"87924","Rich in savory herbs and raspberry liqueur, Nottingham's Livermore Valley Cab is sourced from several regional vineyards. Blended with Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, and aged in French oak, this is an easy drinking wine with deceptive complexity and just the right amount of depth and weight.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87924
"96299","A smoky stony mineral element gives this Rhône-style blend an unorthodox, austere but fascinating personality. Those earthy qualities meet crisp reserved grapefruit and white peach on the palate where a tangy and at first slightly astringent texture warms up to reveal a richer lingering finish.","White","White Blend","US",96299
"67196","This opens with aromas of rose petal, lychee and pear. The intense slightly sweet palate delivers apricot jam, yellow peach and mango. It has nice length and finishes on an energizing mineral note.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",67196
"59045","This rings true as a young Ribera. It has a mild foxy/herbal hint to the black-fruit nose, while the palate is wall-to-wall plump, with flavors that don't just settle on boring. With some pepper and heft on the finish, this is good everyday stuff. Nice texture; a bit herbal.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",59045
"98152","Fresh and savory, this delivers crushed strawberry, red cherry, graphite and cinnamon flavors alongside brisk acidity and supple tannins. Bright and delicate, it offers easy-drinking enjoyment now through 2016.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98152
"88994","Thea's Selection book-ends the single-vineyard wines and is the winery's lower-priced, multi-vineyard blend. As with the Jerome, the flavors are more complex and woven than in the single-vineyard bottlings; with cherry and berry fruit, fresh herb and streaks of bitter chocolate. It's a complete, supple wine, with no holes, moderately ripe fruit, and just a hint of heat in the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88994
"6506","This medium-bodied wine has a vivid, fresh raspberry aroma and deep blackberry flavors supported by firm tannins. It tastes like a cool-climate example because of the vivid fruit, layered tannins and good acidity, which make it well balanced in the style of classic dry reds.","Red","Zinfandel","US",6506
"99700","Aromas like black pepper and red cherries, and flavors like lightly sweet strawberries give this medium-bodied wine a lot to like, besides the very affordable price. It has just a touch of tannin to add some good texture.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99700
"20188","There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality.","White","Chardonnay","US",20188
"5278","Oddly, Silver Lake's least expensive Merlot is its best. It's a solidly made, straight-ahead varietal wine, with a core of black olive and currant, stiff tannins and enough grip to hold up to hearty main meat dishes.","Red","Merlot","US",5278
"51907","A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.","Red","Syrah","Chile",51907
"106316","Baked blackberry, vanilla, caramel and tar on the nose make for a very inviting entry into this rich Syrah from Bibiana González Rave, whose father-in-law, Gary Pisoni, co-developed this vineyard. A firm structure to the sip gives backbone to the lush flavors of dark berry, purple flowers, smoky campfire, maple and bacon fat.","Red","Syrah","US",106316
"27196","Oak is the main characteristic in this Malbec. Spicy aromas of clove and mint steer otherwise generic berry scents toward a thick palate with pointed acidity. This is short on complexity and the fruit is mildly sour, while mint, oak and baked notes define the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",27196
"101720","This wine smells more savory than fruity, and tastes smooth, moderately fruity and easy to enjoy. Medium bodied, it's well balanced between acidity and richness, and not too tannic, giving an appealing mouthfeel.","Red","Primitivo","US",101720
"86739","A whiff of smoked nuts lends savory complexity to bright tangerine, pineapple and white floral aromas in this gorgeously steel-toned wine. Dry and minera, yet silken in texture, it hits the palate with staccato notes of crunchy stone fruit, lemon and lime. It's bracing and brisk now but should meld beautifully over the next decade.","White","Riesling","Germany",86739
"75533","While it is structured and solid, the wine also has rich black fruits that are surrounded by the firm, dry tannins. There is a base of dark chocolate, wood spice and a brooding final quality to the weighty finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",75533
"103731","Spice and red berry aromas are followed by red currant fruit flavors, layers of tannins and juicy acidity. It has made the most of the ripe fruitiness of the vintage and will be ready to drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",103731
"93396","From a small vineyard in the north of the Côte de Nuits, this is a rare white wine in a red-wine region. Lightly toasty, it has spice, pear flavors and perfumed acidity. It's bright and crisp, ending with lively acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",93396
"49610","Ysios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",49610
"77448","A richly rounded wine, impressively dense and powerful. Its ripe tropical and green fruits are integrating well with the toast from wood aging to give great swathes of complex fruit and structure. This is a wine for the long haul. Drink from 2017.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",77448
"100056","Yes, it is spicy, but this is also an elegant wine, balancing its honeyed sweetness and tropical fruits with a stylish acidity and sophisticated perfume. Warm and round at the end, it is ready to drink.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",100056
"104118","A great mix of solid tannins and juicy fruit, this is a rich and structured wine, with the firm character of the year and deep blackberry flavor. It has weight and an edge of spice, finishing with acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",104118
"65989","Georges Duboeuf follows this cru estate, owned by the Meziat family, and produces the wine. It is a ripe wine, shot through with young, juicy acidity. There is structure as well as minerality to give the wine shape. Drink from late 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",65989
"83083","This medium-bodied and sugary tasting wine has lots of apple and pear flavors. The texture is soft and the finish very sweet.","White","Moscato","US",83083
"45632","A blend of five diverse red grapes, this lightly fruity quaffer is almost invisible as far as flavor is concerned. It hits the tongue and vanishes.","Red","Red Blend","US",45632
"91288","While this shows the ripeness of the vintage, it remains very minerally in style, with a lemony crispness to match with its white fruit flavor, tight texture and taut finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",91288
"76727","A blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Cinsault from the 50-year-old Pointe de Diable vineyard, this is a soft and ripe wine. It has light acidity and rich red-berry fruits. It's a wine for apéritif drinking—gentle and fruity at the end (the road to the property is called “End of the World”). Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",76727
"20309","Bright lemon, tangerine and white-floral notes are countered by whiffs of spice and earth on this robust, yet structured, ice wine. The mouthfeel is rich and lush, but brightened by clean, focused acidity and a hint of bitter grape tannin on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",20309
"40849","Hoff is a reliable source for satisfying Barossa Shiraz. The 2005 shows touches of carob to go with its blackberry fruit, a lush, creamy texture and a hint of cracked pepper on the finish. Drink now-2015.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",40849
"24332","Zinfandel fans will celebrate this powerfully ripe, exuberant wine. It's classic Russian River Zin, dry, tannic, heady and enormously rich in black currants, raisins, prunes, beef jerky and exotic baking spices. The finish is so fruity, it's almost sweet, yet is actually quite dry, making it clean and zesty.","Red","Zinfandel","US",24332
"6385","Earthy aromas of olive, tobacco, prune and oak set up a palate with drawing tannins. This tastes of coffee, mocha and earthy mixed berries. The finish is meaty in texture, with compatible oak spice and berry-fruit notes.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",6385
"10583","This is a broad, leafy, late harvest Zinfandel, augmented with a splash of brandy. Mellow cherry tobacco flavors saturate the palate, smooth and lingering, with a lick of vanilla and butterscotch as they weave through the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",10583
"1555","Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",1555
"91913","This straddles the fence between vegetal and citrusy, with both sides appearing on the nose. In the mouth, this is high-toned and piercing, with laser-beam acidity pushing passion fruit, grapefruit, green herb and melony flavors. On the finish, a wave of mild green settles in, while the feel is actually a touch creamy. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",91913
"18524","Streaked with acidity as well as rich, sweet fruits, this is a full and rounded, yet balanced wine with fresh flavors of honey and apricot. This wine could age, so drink now and until 2019.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",18524
"7474","This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak. Rusty bloody aromas of cranberry, peppercorn and carnation lead into a palate framed by stiff tannins and strong acidity. Red-fruit flavors mix with woody spice, and the finish is sticky, showing that this wine is still very young.","Red","Nebbiolo","US",7474
"63747","This basic Tempranillo is violet in color and shows rubbery aromas of black fruit and wild berry. It feels skittish on the palate, with grapey flavors of plum and berry. Juicy, candied and a little warm on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",63747
"41701","Refreshingly crisp in acidity, with a clean mouthfeel and pleasantly rich peach, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. There's even a diesel-like petrol note, like Riesling. Great value in a stylish white wine.","White","Viognier","US",41701
"52276","The awesome nose of this wine is redolent with barbecue sauce, or perhaps a hickory-laced plum sauce, and it's incredibly distinctive if a little bizarre. The palate is full and rich with a similar saucy character, but also shows more complex notes of lush blackberries, rose hips and licorice.","Red","Red Blend","US",52276
"2852","This is a light-bodied and full-flavored wine with a good, gripping texture and plenty of ripe plum and black pepper aromas. A fruity and beefy flavor carries through the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",2852
"53830","This blend of Montepulciano, Syrah and Sangiovese offers aromas of wet earth, black fruit and oak. The palate is a bit closed but reveals blackberry and cherry flavors, with a hint of licorice. This already drinking well so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",53830
"92678","A big firmly structured wine with solid tannins and black-plum-skin texture, the wine is rich and dense. Its fruits are balanced by the concentrated tannins and by the sense of restrained power. Drink from 2023.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",92678
"54218","Classic spicy Blaufränkisch, with flavors of fresh red plum juice, tense acidity and a dark, dry core. This is pure fruit, the tannins deriving from the lightly astringent character of the grapes. Drink now.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",54218
"99203","This wine provides aromas of iron, red currant, cranberry and herb, along with a rubbing alcohol note that provides a bit of distraction. It's reserved but flavorful, with fruit and savory notes lingering on the tart, extended finish.","Red","Syrah","US",99203
"78396","This wine all comes from Watermill Vineyard down in the Rocks District. Seeing only 27% new French oak, it rises up from the glass with appealing aromas of orange peel, moist earth, ember, herb and smoked meat, along with wisps of black olive. The palate is supersmooth and silky, showing a beguiling sense of texture. The concentration seems a bit light at times, but overall it delivers.","Red","Syrah","US",78396
"56928","Notes of red currant, rhubarb, tart strawberry and Cherry Dr. Pepper grace the nose and mouth of this straightforward and easy-drinking red. It's lightweight and softly structured, with a short but clean and pleasant finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",56928
"53856","San Polo offers a very unique interpretation of the 2008 vintage. Rather than focus on bold cherry and leather aromas, this Brunello shows tones of peppermint, chopped herb, cola, ginger and forest berry. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and shows some astringency that will soften with time.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",53856
"71689","As advertised, this lush white is barrel fermented in 40% new French oak, and it imparts quite a bit of that upbringing in its toasty character. Apple and preserved lemon offset ripe fruit flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",71689
"53295","This crisp, citrus-flavored wine has bright acidity and a touch of vanilla. It has great fruitiness, dominated by lemon with the tang of orange zest. It is ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",53295
"55439","A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",55439
"77071","Flowers, tangerine peel, peach and herb aromas are followed by medium-sweet blood orange flavors. It provides interest but the concentration doesn't seem all there.","White","Riesling","US",77071
"96652","The vineyard is in the cooler Green Valley, and this Pinot shows its terroir in the vital acidity that brightens pure, intense cherry, blueberry and blackberry fruit flavors. It's an elegant wine, but tannic. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96652
"78475","One of the best Sangiovese out there, mainly due to the ripe balance. Avoids the unripeness or excessive ripeness that can mar this variety in California. Shows lovely, rich black cherry, raspberry and cocoa flavors, enhanced with sweet oak. The next step is to elevate this wine to complex greatness, especially at this price.","Red","Sangiovese","US",78475
"22893","This wine has just enough residual sugar to take it to the upper threshhold of dry. It's quite full flavored with a thirst quenching mix of citrus, apple and pineapple. Crisp acidity enhances the freshness and contributes a tangy, lemony kick to the finish.","White","Riesling","US",22893
"91351","Tastes sharp in acidity, dry and difficult now. The cherry candy, currant and oak flavors are rich, but the gritty mouthfeel is hard to like.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",91351
"32481","This block-designation wine from the tip of the appellation shows an extremely spicy nose of incense and concentrated hibiscus. It proves rather light on the palate, yet bounces with the flavors of rose petals and violets, emerging into black pepper, clove and cinnamon. It's lean yet bountiful with intrigue.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32481
"48123","Winemaker Matt Dicey has crafted a winner, seamlessly combining aromas and flavors of toast, cherry, smoke and dried herbs into a relatively full-bodied, muscular wine. Although firm, it's approachable now, as the finish fades elegantly into dusty tannins laced with mocha and berries. Drink now–2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",48123
"95200","A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",95200
"34004","This blend of Niellucciu, Sciaccerellu and Syrah is both rich and stalky. That gives acidity, black currant fruit and a youthful texture. It's balanced with rich tannins which will allow it to age further. Drink from late 2018.","Red","Red Blend","France",34004

"64573","Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a “Pet” fan, this is the one to buy.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",64573
"21879","A silky ripe wine that has great yellow and white stone fruits. That is contrasted with a strongly mineral character, touches of honey and intense acidity. The wine is still young but it has a delicious future. Drink starting from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",21879

"63047","Plump and loaded with sweet and tangy red and purple fruits, this lush table wine mixes flavors of raspberry, black cherry and plum hard candy with bracing acids.

It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.","Red","Carmenère","US",4229

Sourced from the Upland vineyard in the tiny Snipes Mountain AVA, it is bursting with pure, sweet fruit flavors, tart and lip-smackingly juicy. A subtle minerality with a hint of wet cement gives it tannic authority, while the aging in once-filled French oak barrels adds a touch of baking spices.","Red","Grenache","US",28929

"31091","From a single parcel that is above the emblematic windmill of Moulin-à-Vent, this wine shows its 16 months of wood aging in its smooth and perfumed character.

"52233","With its potent mixture of intense fruit and equally concentrated structure, this wine is an obvious candidate for long-term aging. Showing ripe yellow fruit, almond hints and a strong mineral texture, it will develop slowly and be best from 2022.

"69367","This has a traditional medium-garnet color with brick rim. Effusive aromas that are smoky, beefy and earthy lead to distinctive wild berry, sage and cherry flavors.

"20339","Lonesome Spring and Clifton fruit goes into this Grenache, which includes 16% Syrah and 8% Mourvèdre. Very spicy and pretty aromas invite sipping; the white pepper stands out, along with tart raspberry/cranberry fruit.

"77268","This is a generous mouthful of Cabernet, with just small amounts of Merlot and Carmenère in the blend.

There is some dryness on the finish, as well as a pleasant astringency. Drink until 2019.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",19342
"89152","Mature woody aromas of foresty berry, cigar box and vanilla set up a palate that's mature but still fresh. Spicy oaky flavors of cherry and plum come with a hint of chocolate, while this ends with integrated notes of coffee and mocha. Drink through 2025.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",89152
"55247","Almond and anise open what evolves into a concentrated expression of a stellar vineyard site in a great vintage in good winemaking hands. Honey and baked peach initially fool the palate into anticipating that this wine might head into full-blown hedonism, but subtle layers of lemon, grapefruit and pear keep it crisp, fresh and ultimately complex. Creamy, it retains plenty of acidity for balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",55247
"63057","This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",63057
"102662","This is balanced and ripe with some firm tannins and spice. The blackberry fruit has a stalky character with plenty of acidity as well as a dry core of tannin. The wine will develop well over the next few years to create a ripe and gently structured wine. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",102662
"22089","Baked plum, exotic spice, forest floor, pressed violet and balsamic aromas lead the way. The big juicy palate offers fleshy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha and vanilla while velvety tannins provide both support and finesse. Thanks to the succulent fruit, you won't detect the hefty alcohol. Drink 2018–2026.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",22089
"91010","The wine feels lean, the fruit fading behind the bare bones of a wine. The tannins show through dry and solid, and the finish has attractive acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",91010
"2506","Cola, coconut and ripe blackberry aromas are draped all over the wine's bouquet. On the palate, it's a bit choppy and acidic, with pounding flavors of black cherry, blackberry and leather. Juicy, zesty and jagged feeling at the moment, this should be consumed no earlier than 2014 and may be at its best around 2018.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",2506
"27275","An appealing nose of pepper and chocolate lead to raspberry and spice flavors that are balanced by medium tannins and an acidity that offers a mineral spin. Good and accessible.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",27275
"51746","A big bruiser of a wine that hits you with its big, rich fist of blackberry fruits and sweetness. Maybe it is not elegant, but there is no denying the force behind this wine, the spice to go with the velvet texture.","Red","Syrah","Portugal",51746
"10886","This blend of 60% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon is bright and balanced, with fruity notes of black plum and cherry dusted by accents of tobacco, licorice and lightly charred wood. Medium weight and enjoyable, the tannins are mouthcoating but fine and the finish deliciously spicy.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Israel",10886
"58842","89–91. Barrel sample. This chateau has been newly acquired by the Barton family of Léoville Barton. It's an attractive, fruity wine with warm tannins. The palate is fine and juicy, and finishes softly at the end.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",58842
"46021","This Chardonnay offers broad, subtle scents of fresh oak and pear with a soft, fleshy palate. It finishes on a woody clove note.","White","Chardonnay","US",46021
"3485","Rugged rustic gritty aromas of roasted plum, saddle leather and baked beans may cause some head scratching. Speaking of scratch, this is scratchy on the palate and a bit weak in the middle. Flavors of stewed berry fruits and rubber finish with grating tannins.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",3485
"62168","From one of the few estate properties in this new appellation comes anise-flecked aromas of blackberry puff pastry, mixing up ripe fruit with buttery oak. This is a very approachable Syrah, with dark fruits and pepper spice that will appeal widely, showing why Ballard Canyon may be the variety's best hope for popular acceptance.","Red","Syrah","US",62168
"99072","The Tavel cave cooperative also bottles wine from neighboring Lirac. This is an attractive, creamy-textured, supple wine that's ready to drink. Black cherries, dark chocolate and spice box notes finish soft and plush. Drink now–2019.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",99072
"88616","This is the first Chardonnay release from Anam Cara, estate grown from young vines, and softened by secondary fermentation. The flavors suggest almond and butter, light citrus, a whiff of toast and a taste of cracker. It's smooth, with a lemony finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",88616
"59379","This is a value white, with fresh tones of citrus, pear and stone fruit. Zesty crispness marks the finish, making it perfect for smoked salmon with cream cheese.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",59379
"31963","This has a powdery nose and melony, tropical fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is pleasant and round, with vital acidity. Flavors of baked apple, buttercup and briny apricot finish smooth, with a pinch of salt.","White","Viognier","Chile",31963
"2546","Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.","White","Chardonnay","France",2546
"37263","Structured from the start, this wine provides succulent boysenberry and blackberry around a full-figured body that's otherwise steeped in vanilla and coffee, the toasted oak quite prevalent. It finishes slightly tart in dried herb and mushroom.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",37263
"15622","The luminous sparkler offers sweet aromas of peach, honey and jasmine. Pair this this bubbly treat with oatmeal cookies or sponge cake.","White","Moscato","Italy",15622
"34352","This is an intense and austere sparkling wine with persistent perlage and deep aromas of toast, roasted nut, honey, stone fruit and butterscotch. You'll also get a playful hint of chopped herbs that add buoyancy to the wine's thick, solid mouthfeel.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",34352
"1171","A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate. Those looking for texture as well as flavor will not be disappointed. Those who have the patience to cellar this will be rewarded with complex, mature flavors and great concentration. Drink 2016–2020.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",1171
"99817","Vanilla aromas indicate that wood aging has made an already ripe wine even richer. The tannins are still young, calling for aging, but bold cherry and red plum tones are ripe, full bodied and open. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019.","Red","Gamay","France",99817
"23734","Soft and simple, with sweet flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, cola and smoky oak. Gets the Pinot job done with admirable silkiness and crispness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",23734
"74187","Not much of this wine is made and that's a shame. A celebration of richness and creaminess on the palate, the wine is given extended lees contact to contribute both texture and complexity. Marked by oaky caramel notes on the nose and palate, the wine also shows minerality and freshness, especially on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",74187
"60052","A sweet, soft, harmonious Pinot Noir. Feels so gentle in the mouth, it hardly has any weight, yet it's a very serious wine. The flavors are enormous, suggesting ripe wild cherries, raspberry liqueur and baking spices, finished with perfectly applied, smoky oak, and brightened with fine acidity. A wine of great charm, it should continue to develop in the bottle for six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60052
"30969","This estate's flagship wine delivers sugar beets, Indian spice, black currant, cedar and sandalwood. It's smooth and fruity but a bit short on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",30969
"91835","Hearty aromas of baking spices, roasted fennel, ginger and light licorice give nuance to dried cherry, cranberry, beef bourguignon and sweet onion scents on this wine from the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The palate is all about exotic spice, from sandalwood and myrrh to oregano, thyme, marjoram and black cardamom, all hanging on a lush, dark-fruit core.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91835
"30410","This is a lush, ripe Chardonnay from a cool subregion of the Adelaide Hills. Grilled peaches and toasted coconut elements lend an exotic edge to this full-bodied wine. Drink it over the next few years.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",30410
"9966","This barrel selection brings bright flavors of salmonberry and raspberry, with highlights of citrus peel. It's precise and tart; less ripe than many wines from this warm year, but balanced and focused.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9966
"56088","Oaky, dry and acidic, this Chard is saved by the ripeness of the underlying fruit, which gives green apple, peach, pear and pineapple flavors. The acidity hangs in there all the way through the tart finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",56088
"21501","This is Swanson's top Cabernet, which includes a splash of Merlot. As always, it's rich, tannic and dry, and it possesses a deep core of blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems more tannic and sharp than in previous vintages, which suggests its ageability. Try holding it until 2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",21501
"55382","This wine was aged for 32 months in 85% new French oak but you'd never know it based on the vibrant aromas of iron, earth, bacon fat, black olive, garigue, orange peel, dried flower and purple fruit. This leads to a mouthful of fruit and savory flavors that coat the palate from end to end, finishing savory with abundant black olive notes. The sense of balance is exquisite as is the delicacy.","Red","Syrah","US",55382
"73390","A good wine. It's nicely dry, with crisp acids and adequate tannins. There's a pretty good balance between plum and berry flavors and earthy, herbal ones. It's rough around the edges, with a burnt-rubber quality, but okay drinking for everyday occasions. —S.H.","Red","Shiraz","US",73390
"47336","A blend of various vineyards, this is a seamless Cabernet, impossible to find any fault with. It's just perfect in structural integrity and sweet, oak-accented blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit. So delicious, you'll want to drink it now, and that's just fine.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47336
"83878","From a cool site, this is a viscous, oily white. Crisp in pear and almond, it drinks light and yet has enough heft on the mouthfeel to stay interesting and compatible with food. If Roussanne is a varietal of interest, this wine (made in small amounts) should be on the list of those to try.","White","Roussanne","US",83878
"66453","In good vintages like 2004, Deyo can be one of Spain's best Merlots. The fact that it is one of Spain's only Merlots is moot when you taste Deyo's warm and spicy black fruit, its fine-grained oak, and then all the coffee, butter and pepper that work the finish. A little tannic and grabby, but food will offset that.","Red","Merlot","Spain",66453
"69884","A venture into the deep end of pricing perhaps, but the proof is in the bottle. From vines planted in 1964, this is a rich, full-bodied and creamy-textured wine, with complex notes of smoke, vanilla, plum and roasted meat. Approachable now because of its lushness, it should drink well for at least the next several years.","Red","Grenache","Australia",69884
"88492","Fresh fruit aromas, dominated by black cherry, expand on the substantial palate. This wine is a rich, robust and ripely built expression of a dark-horse grape in these parts. Black licorice dots a jammy concentration of fruit and of the rich texture, rewarding those who like their wines powerfully packed.","Red","Tannat","US",88492
"105403","A striking and flavorful wine, this bottling shows a little more spicy oak than most of the Renwoods, giving a slightly sweet cinnamon accent to the vivid blackberry and strawberry syrup flavors. The fruit character is powerful and delicious, seemingly seeping out of the wine in all directions. It's dry, full bodied, firm textured and will drink nicely now through 2020.","Red","Zinfandel","US",105403
"82865","The eucalyptus in this wine detracts from what else might be going on. It provides a medicinal atmosphere that's hard to shake, leading the way to a lean, bitter finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",82865
"53164","Significantly riper than the winery's two other Pinot Gris releases, this seems a bit flat in comparison. It's got plenty of ripe pear and apple-butter flavors, along with a touch of cinnamon. The overall ripeness and weight suggest drinking it up over the next year or two.","White","Pinot Gris","US",53164
"34951","Aromatic hints of creamy stone fruit swirls about the nose. There are hints of Mirabelle plums and yellow pear but on the palate very fine, smoky and exquisitely integrated notes of French oak appear. There is rich vanilla and cream but with a counterpoint of fresh, bright lemony acidity. While stylistically unusual this barrique-aged Grüner certainly is a delicious, creamy and serious wine. You'd never even guess it's already four-years-old. Ready now but will evolve. Drink 2016–2022.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",34951
"64838","Percarlo is an outstandingly intense and complex Sangiovese that is true to its Tuscan roots. Aromas are wide and penetrating and span the gamut of balsam possibilities, voluptuous fruit, lead pencil and spice. It is round and very fragrant in the mouth with plush smoothness and soft extraction.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",64838
"6045","Lush, composed and fresh on the bouquet, with blackberry and perfect prune aromas. This is mouthfilling and smooth, with a firm, flush tannic structure and flavors of coconut, lemon rind, herbal black fruit and red berry. It's long and supple late, and it's arguably one of the best Cabernet Sauvignons you'll find from Spain and Navarra.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",6045
"25001","Structured and balanced, this wine has great fruits that go with the tannins and rich texture. There is an unusually low amount of Merlot (60%) with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc for the area, yet there is a strongly juicy feel to the wine that gives a generous side. It is developing well; drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",25001
"52707","A blend of Cabernet from Grand Ciel (31%), Ciel du Cheval (30%), Upchurch (28%) and Klipsun (11%) vineyards, wood spice aromas start out up front. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, with the tannins bringing some grip.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52707
"15842","Light in color, this delicate wine is herbal and yet bright in Bing cherry, quite nuanced and slight at first, unveiling its concentration and complexity slowly and seductively over time. Made by longtime grape growers, the acidity is lively and the weight slim, traces of restrained oak and garden herb dancing in the background. Only 54 cases made.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15842
"41741","A good everyday Merlot that's dry and softly tannic, with pleasant cherry, cola and spice flavors.","Red","Merlot","US",41741
"84569","This rounded, wood-aged wine has just the right amount of structure and delicious acidity to accompany the full red- and black-berry notes. It's refreshing, while still concentrated and age worthy.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",84569
"88504","Earthy underbrush, leather, scorched earth, dark spice and toasted hazelnut aromas lead the way. The firm palate shows dried cherry, licorice and tobacco flavors alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",88504
"89826","This wine is not impressive in any way. It's tannic, abrasive and tastes stalky and weedy. The finish is rough and green, like rocks in the mouth.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",89826
"26148","Full, ripe and smoky, this well-balanced wine has a dense texture to offset the bright red fruits and acidity. Spice, smoky flavors and a fresh red fruit aftertaste give a ready-to-drink feel.","Red","Gamay","France",26148
"106010","The wine tastes richer and more full-bodied than its light alcohol would suggest. That's good, with plenty of fresh fruits that also have a creamy texture and bright acidity that is fully integrated with the mineral texture and crisp aftertaste. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",106010
"20216","Brilliant acidity gives this wine a clean raciness that so many Sauvignon Blancs lack. It has ripe, forward flavors of lemons, limes, apricots, peaches and honey, but despite the richness is dry and minerally.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",20216
"89546","There's a distinct herbal hint to the green pear notes on the nose of this wine. The light palate leads with white pepper, pear and lemon flavors, and the finish is clean and dry.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",89546
"68950","Starting to show its age with a pale golden hue, this fumé is classy and restrained. Aromas of waxy lemon, pineapple and green bean mingle with base notes of butterscotch and smoke from the oak. The palate offers less excitement with the fruit disappearing some and searing acidity taking over. Nevertheless, this wine would be a versatile pairing for a variety of dishes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",68950
"77091","This wine offers fruit-forward aromas of raspberries, plum and cranberry. It drinks off dry (10g/L residual sugar) with abundant red fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins leading to herb flavors on the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",77091
"91057","Tar and cherries in the nose, and the follow-through shows thick, ripe, sweet cherry fruit with some dark, tarry underpinnings. Good concentration and a long finish. There is 11% Petite Sirah, which adds color and depth.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91057
"51390","Heavy oak is a major theme on this full-bodied Malbec that's cool and woody to start, with aromas of vanilla and sweet plastic along with ripe blackberry and cassis. Wall-to-wall huge in mouthfeel, this tastes mostly of toasty oak, with blackened, charred berry, mint and peppery flavors in the backdrop. In time look for the oak to settle and the fruit to emerge. Drink through 2021.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",51390
"70352","Intense, concentrated aromas of rubber band, blackened spices, mint and eucalyptus lead to a shear, rock-hard palate that offers almost zero cushion to absorb massively rugged tannins. Woody, minty blackberry flavors end with heavy oak, herbal notes and blatant astringency. Drink 2018–2030.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",70352
"8075","Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.","Red","Merlot","US",8075
"62323","This no-herbicide, hand-picked, hilltop Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon-Petit Verdot blend is rich with attractive acidity and ripe strawberry fruits. Its tannins present a structure for fruity texture. A wine from Bordeaux wine guru Professor Denis Dubourdieu's stable, it has concentration and a dense dark aftertaste. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",62323
"70020","This is quite delicious, bright and tasting of fresh-squeezed oranges and tangerines. Fruity, forward and lush, it's really quite charming. The aromas convey light hints of rose petals, jasmine and honey; the fruit an intriguing mix of ripe pear, papaya and apricot.","White","Viognier","US",70020
"78423","Concentrated notes of pear peel and lemon zest make for an intense nose. The palate is juicy, light and fresh and majors on white-pear flesh with a bright touch of lemon that is dry and invigorating. The finish tingles with white pepper and lemon freshness.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",78423
"91051","Smoke and oak dominate the nose, with some fairly light, pretty fruit underneath. The oak seems mismatched for the weight of the fruit, which is sweet and charming, like cherry lifesavers.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91051
"48394","Beautifully packaged, with a 1920s-style label, this opens with whopping heat and huge chocolate-fudge and cherry syrup flavors. It would be impossible to exaggerate how big and bold this is.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",48394
"49379","Fans of structured Chard should give this a try. Ripe citrus flavors are subtly framed by toasty oak in a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp and minerally. Good now, but should last through 2010.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",49379
"100842","Sour fruit, funky root beer, dried salami and asphalt aromas show on the nose of this rustic bottling. Dried fruit and espresso flavors mark the palate.","Red","Red Blend","US",100842
"101149","Taut, young and laced with accents of bitter greens, the fruit is peppery and sharp, with plenty of backing acidity. Tannins are proportionate and well managed, while the finish is short, showing mostly acid and herbal components.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101149
"92752","This opens with aromas of black plum and baking spice that carry over to the straightforward palate together with a touch of pepper. Round tannins provide easygoing support. Drink soon.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",92752
"40690","The 2011 vintage wasn't an easy one in South Australia to say the least, which makes this wine all the more admirable. Mouthwatering, peppery, red-currant fruit remains firm and focused from start to finish, ending on a crisp note. Drink now–2023.","Red","Grenache","Australia",40690
"13938","This vibrant, full-bodied wine combines truly vibrant fruit flavors like black cherry and black grapes with a broad and juicy texture. It delivers a sense of layering of fruit flavors on the palate and a lingering, ripe finish.","Red","Barbera","US",13938
"9644","This is a ripe and plump Brunello that could use two or three years of cellar aging to allow the oak notes to fully integrate. The quality of the fruit is excellent—cherry, blackberry and currants abound. Immediately behind those aromas, however, is loads of spice, smoke and tar. Drink after 2012.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",9644
"72370","A fresh, crisp wine that brings out the pepper character of Grüner along with an attractive creamy citrus flavor. The wine has good acidity and a final lemon zest.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",72370
"70223","Aromas suggesting sun-baked earth, leather, underbrush, ripe plum, espresso and a balsamic note lead the way. On the full-bodied palate, licorice and clove notes add depth to a core of ripe dried cherry. Solid tannins provide the firm framework.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",70223
"3656","This wine's underbrush, truffle, leather and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, espresso, oak-driven spice and toast flavors framed by close-grained tannins. Roasted coffee bean and powdered sage notes mark the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",3656
"53391","Light sage, thyme and earth aromas top the ripe blackberry and plum flavors of this well-built, rich and fruity wine. Full bodied, it has soft tannins and a touch of candied fruit on the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",53391
"66804","Herb, dried leaf, green pepper, tobacco and spice aromas are followed by plump yet elegant cherry and tobacco flavors. Smoke and savory notes linger on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",66804
"74052","Sourced from 35-year-old Wente clone vines, this offers bright apple with hints of peach. It's medium bodied and streaked with flavors of caramel and butterfinger candy.","White","Chardonnay","US",74052
"5773","This wine is somewhat diluted and one-dimensional. It makes a straightforward attempt at bringing a richness of apple and anise to the fore around neutral oak dynamics before finishing ripe and full.","White","Chardonnay","US",5773
"63200","While the producer does have vines in Volnay, this wine comes from the negociant side of the business. The wine has structure and some firm tannins. At this stage, the Volnay roundness lies behind the dry surface. But it does have weight and the potential to age well. Drink from 2021.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",63200
"100227","A blend of Red Willow Merlot (61%) and Angela's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers savory aromas of herbs, nori and peanut shells. The palate shows good concentration to the sweet coffee and cherry flavors that display a supple feel and are backed by lightly chewy tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",100227
"52069","This is so toasty and heavily oaked that it smells burnt and acrid. In the mouth this is pinched, tannic and tough. Flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla finish scratchy and abrasive with drum-like tightness. Drink now.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",52069
"102938","Held back for four-plus years before release, this Bordeaux blend has become softly gentle and approachable. It's rich in cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors, with a gorgeous, plump coating of sweet, toasted oak. Drink over the next five years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",102938
"14225","This wine's ripe berry aromas include integrated oak, tar and vanilla notes. Its plum, raspberry, vanilla and cream flavors are appealing, yet it finishes raw, jagged and a bit shrill.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",14225
"101156","Spicy, oaky aromas grab attention, followed by black plum and cherry flavors and a firm structure of tannins and acidity. This is full bodied and rather powerful in both flavor and mouthfeel.","Red","Merlot","US",101156
"87805","A whiff of yeasty baked bread opens the bouquet of this 100% varietal wine that's plenty juicy and drinkable right now. Plum surrounds integrated tannins and a powerful midpalate, suggesting an ability to age. The finish is all about mocha. Cellar through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",87805
"93724","Hints of smoke and earth on the nose lead to a riper and sweeter, approachably fruity palate. It's a light bodied spätlese, easy drinking, with loads of sunny, sweet white grapefruit and tangerine flavors. Drink now.","White","Riesling","Germany",93724
"87707","This is an elegant, heady Chardonnay beaming in floral jasmine aromas, honey and oak. Bright on the palate, it offers lively acidity and an abundance of pineapple and mango, tropical in all the right ways.","White","Chardonnay","US",87707
"9992","This is the top wine from Balland, who is based in the Coteaux du Giennois further north. Taking its name from the limestone pebbles in the vineyard, it is textured, mineral and zesty. Crisp lemon and warmer green plums give it tautness and add a richer element. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",9992
"102109","It's impossible to imagine this wine could have existed even five years ago, even though it hails from the extraordinary Nielson Vineyard that for many years has yielded Byron's best Pinot Noirs, as well as Chardonnays. The ripeness level is something only modern techniques could achieve, and the 2007 vintage was great. Ultrarich in blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, the wine retains a silky texture and is imposingly full-bodied. Drink now–2013.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",102109
"4743","Ott specializes in rosés with weight and alcohol. Everything is so well integrated that they are only a part of a rich, fruity wine that has a dense texture, with spice and generous strawberry fruits. Full and definitely for food, the wine should be aged another few months, so drink from mid-2016.","Rosé","Rosé","France",4743
"18923","Black and white pepper splash all over the aromas of the otherwise cherry meringue-driven nose of this blend of 39% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 26% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. It's light and airy on the palate, blending fresh strawberry fruit with a cornucopia of peppercorns. It provides a great example of how a fun, lively wine can be savorily serious as well.","Red","G-S-M","US",18923
"90090","With a strange pink color and powdery nondescript aromas, this is shapeless and lacking in structure. Weak bitter flavors are completely fruitless; overall this seems to be going nowhere good.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",90090
"106197","This wine shows much less oak influence than Pepik's Zdar bottling, but in this case that's a good thing. The fruit is herbal and perhaps a bit tomatoey, but there's enough cherry to hold things together, with smoke and sous-bois notes for complexity. It's a light- to medium-bodied wine that finishes on a crisp note. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",106197
"55797","A vineyard along the Silverado Trail in Napa, not far from the winery, Grande was planted in 1920 and is still farmed by the original farmer's family, Dorothy and Tony Rossi. Here, it offers structure and elegance despite a brooding weight and power, the flavors leaning toward blackberry and licorice.","Red","Zinfandel","US",55797
"56714","This is a full, ripe wine that's rounded and rich on the palate. With ripe yellow fruit and tangerine flavors, it's tropical in style, although there is a tangy lemon edge to it to keep it crisp and herbaceous.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",56714
"24453","With strong fruity aromas like lemon and lime, this wine starts off bold and then turns more mellow and smooth on the palate. It has light vanilla accents and a creamy texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",24453
"60019","A good buy for its dryness and overall balance. You won't mistake it for a cult Cabernet, but the blackberry and currant flavors work.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60019
"21808","The aromas are light, with notes of yellow apple and spice. The palate is rounded in feel, showing a lovely sense of texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",21808
"25412","Quite a bit of spicy, sweet-seeming oak flavors give this full-bodied wine an extravagant flair to match its rather hot mouthfeel and firm tannins.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",25412
"29540","Villa's Seddon vineyard is located in the Awatere Valley—a Marlborough subregion that's generally cooler than the main valley. As a result, this is a slightly lighter, more herbal rendering of Pinot Noir, but one that avoids any overt greenness or astringency. It's complex, elegant and silky—just like more Pinots should be.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",29540
"68401","An Amaro-like mix of bitters and herbs; this is exceptionally dense and dark. The fruit is a grace note; the big flavors come from herb, earth, rock, barrel and more. Licorice, baking spices, smoke, black cherry, Bourbon barrel, and on it goes. Huge and dense and seemingly endless.","Red","Syrah","US",68401
"84736","A first-class Zinfandel, showing the variety's briary, brambly personality. The flavors are of ripe wild summer berries, cola, pine extract, black pepper and cinnamon, wrapped into firm tannins and finishing sweet and long.","Red","Zinfandel","US",84736
"87945","Vanilla, herb, cherry, coconut and barrel spice aromas are followed by supple cherry and spice flavors in this wine. The barrel influence is a bit up-front, but it still provides plenty of pleasure.","Red","Merlot","US",87945
"29963","Subtle hints of green pear meet yeasty pepperiness head-on. The palate is focused and concentrated and has a spine that tingles with crisp acidity and more pepper. This is inviting, moreish and very drinkable despite its comparative seriousness. Pepper and zest linger.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",29963
"82577","Upon opening, this smells oaky and lemony, although airing brings it around. Fresh and mildly astringent on the palate, this tastes oaky and briny at first, then more complex, deep and toasty as it spreads out. Licorice, herb and background berry flavors are woody and still somewhat fiery on the finish. Drink 2015 through 2025.","Red","Mencía","Spain",82577
"36499","Gamy, fascinating aromas of bloody beef, charred lamb chops and dank mushrooms meet with cracked black pepper and asphalt on the nose of this wine from a coastal vineyard near Cambria. Similar sensations show on the palate, including underripe boysenberry, dried lilac, lavender, black pepper, pencil lead and dry-aged meat.","Red","Syrah","US",36499
"98407","The stately hillside line of cypress trees gives its name to this estate on the south bank of the Douro. This complex, rich and dark wine is densely textured. The tannins are still young, while the black berry fruits pack into the solid structure. This is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",98407
"37482","Clean on the nose, with pure citrus and minerality. It's full but not heavy in the mouth, with developed, mature flavors of grapefruit and other citrus fruits. Mildly pithy, green and long on the finish. Not a prima ballerina; this has force and strength along with elegance.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",37482
"9469","Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",9469
"52213","Stalky, lightly vegetal aromas come with notes of match stick and bitterness. This feels fresh in the mouth but tastes briny, with citrus, jalapeño and green bean accents. A bland, pithy finish feels round. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",52213
"63766","This simple Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly fruity and forward, with berry flavors that seem to fade on the midpalate. It resolves in a wash of drying, herbal tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63766
"62470","Fragrant blue flower, ripe berry, scorched earth and a whiff of new leather unfold in the glass. The big, chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, ground pepper, clove, star anise and a hint of game framed in youthfully austere, teeth coating tannins. Drink after 2021.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",62470
"11312","An layered nose shows pan-fried apples, caramelized pears, just-ripe banana, roasted chicken and slight quinine aromas. The palate starts tropical and fat, with banana and mango flavors, but settles into a smoked, oaky-apple groove, hinged to steely tension.","White","Roussanne","US",11312
"6994","Nemus pairs the light fruit and crisp acidity of Sangiovese against the hearty firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon to produce an informal, food-friendly wine that would match pasta dishes and pizza with fresh mozzarella.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",6994
"46759","Lush in toffee and rounded layers of rich oak and crème brûlée, this sultry Chardonnay delivers a lot of heft. The wine is crafted from a stellar vineyard and given just over a year in 50% new French oak. The toasty notes are balanced by a taste of pear tart in custard.","White","Chardonnay","US",46759
"83170","Barrel-fermented and aged on the lees, this Burgundian-style Chard is creamy and rich in ripe tropical fruit flavors and new oak. It's a big wine, forward in pineapple and mango flavors that are honey-ripe and crisp.","White","Chardonnay","US",83170
"84904","Cigar box and mulberry spice aromas lead the nose of this Cab, with fruity notes of black berry and cassis providing the backdrop. Full and lush in the mouth, the ripe black fruit carries through to the finish alongside accents of roasted coffee grounds. 550 cases imported.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",84904
"5462","An astoundingly characterful rosé, the Mordorée Tavel has a hugely complex nose of cherry, carnation and strawberry set against a backdrop of herbes de Provence. Intensely flavorful in the mouth, this wine finishes on a long note of lemon zest and white cherries. An excellent foil for roast pork.","Rosé","Rosé","France",5462
"23939","Heady potpourri notes of rose petal and spice, lychee and melon abound on this high-impact but refined Gewürztraminer. Off dry and delicately framed, it's a refreshing sip marked by sunny squirts of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2017.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",23939
"101188","Minerally white-fruit aromas lack specificity. This is fresh but standard in feel, with briny flavors of nectarine, apple, citrus pith and nut skins. A dilute finish is fresh but thin. Why this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Airén and Verdejo costs what it does is beyond comprehension because it smells, tastes and feels generic.","White","White Blend","Spain",101188
"76271","If you know Chardonnays from the Edna Valley, on California's Central Coast, this tastes like one. It's bright in acidity and forward in jammy lime, kiwi and vanilla fruit, with a stony minerality. It's a pretty wine to drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",76271
"81883","Dense, with a substantial amount of tannin and oak upfront, this clone designate, 100% varietal, is chalky in texture and showy in oak. Red currant, cedar and an unfurling of tobacco leaf provide fruit and savory herbaceousness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",81883
"65067","This wine is widely distributed and often discounted, but don't shy away from it because of that—it's really well made. Subtle herb and citrus shadings mark the nose, but so do riper hints of fig and melon. Those riper notes shape the palate, giving it breadth up front, then gently tapering into a long, elegant, citrusy finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",65067
"62646","Fiery berry aromas come across sort of rough and scratchy. The palate is softer and more creamy, with vanilla, berry and pepper flavors. Finishes toasty and peppery, albeit slightly bitter.","Red","Tempranillo","Argentina",62646
"52704","Tire rubber, herb and locked-up barrel spice notes are followed by bountiful yet elegant black fruit flavors that show a spot on sense of balance along with exquisite length. There's no hiding the warm vintage it comes from but it shows the year well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52704
"49314","Saint Clair's Pioneer Block wines are always worth trying for their expressions of Marlborough's subregional characters. This one, from deep clay soils at the foot of the Dry Hills, features a bold cherry aroma and flavor, backed by ample vanilla and baking spice notes. It's big and slightly chunky in style, but it seems likely to smooth out over the next 12 months as the dusty tannins subside.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",49314
"102835","Both rich and dense, this wine shows the ripeness of the Merlot in 2010. It has firm fruit, touches of dark chocolate and licorice. With its concentration, this small vineyard is now in good form, producing ageworthy wines.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",102835
"28699","A blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Bianco, this has sensations of yellow apples, beeswax, citrus and mineral. It's simple but well made and would work well with lightly seasoned fish or pasta dishes topped with vegetable sauces.","White","White Blend","Italy",28699
"52398","This affordably priced county wine is simple in structure, showcasing clove, cedar and black currant flavors on the full-bodied, concentrated palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52398
"36599","Crisp, light and dry, this wine is ready for the next lunch, brunch or warm-weather cocktail party. It has light, melon aromas, refreshing peach and melon flavors and an appetizing, tangy texture.","Rosé","Rosé","US",36599
"36460","Classic Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, wild berry, new leather and chopped Mediterranean herb lead the nose along with a whiff of blue flower. The delicious, chewy palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry, baking spice and star anise framed in youthfully assertive but ripe tannins. Drink 2019–2029.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",36460
"102097","With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",102097
"71327","Quite light in the glass, this bottling by James Sparks of Liquid Farm fame shows cherry, hibiscus, cola and a touch of garrigue on the delicate nose. There is a noticeable tannic structure to the sip, where red-cherry and rose-petal flavors are quite mellow, refreshing and very quaffable. Time may add more complexity, but it's fun and lively now.","Red","Grenache","US",71327
"87319","Barely there but intriguing notes of pears draw you in first. The soft body promises refreshment and rounded pleasure, with just enough phenolic texture and a hint of salty minerality.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",87319
"80150","A pretty good Chardonnay, especially at this price. Delivers lots of bang for the buck, with ripe, honeyed flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.","White","Chardonnay","US",80150
"35411","This has aromas of stalky underbrush, porcini mushroom, game and berry. The wine's uber-simple palate shows suggestions of wild cherry and a hint of clove alongside drying, fleeting tannins and brisk acidity.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",35411
"95837","A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc and 11% Petit Verdot, this wine combines them all to herbaceous, slightly green and puckering effect, the oak overwhelmingly audacious.","Red","Red Blend","US",95837
"30437","A touch of reduction clings to the nose but the palate spells an abundance of fresh, crunchy red cherry. The slender body unfolds in joyful fruit and brims with freshness. This is light-bodied but utterly governed by delicious red-cherry fruit. Drink soon.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",30437
"88091","Stewed olallieberries and black cherries gain nuance from concentrated red rose petals, cola and gravel on this wine from Riverside County. Like many of this winery's bottlings, the palate shows lots of barrel influence, with strong vanilla elements laced amidst blueberry and lighter red fruits.","Red","Syrah","US",88091
"26388","A wonderfully subtle touch of chamomile and yarrow appears first. This is followed by tart apple and citrus notes that also play vividly on the palate. The body is dry and slender, translucent and herbal. There is wonderful energy and drive despite the lightness. The depth of flavor, with that herbal tang, remains beguiling from the start to the long, long finish.","White","Riesling","France",26388
"87173","In this straightforward quaffer, aromas of pear, melon and apple lead to off-dry fruit flavors with a full feel. The flavor concentration is light but it still provides easy drinking enjoyment.","White","Pinot Gris","US",87173
"22166","A fine vintage of this always delicious Chablis. The wine has weight, a sense of warmth from its yellow fruits and depth of flavor. Full and ripe in the mouth, it will age for a year, although it is drinkable already.","White","Chardonnay","France",22166
"20374","Barrel-fermented and aged briefly in 20% new French oak, this wine offers a whiff of barrel reduction before revealing a well-defined profile of lemon and stone fruit. From vineyards in both Dry Creek and Sonoma valleys, it wears its oak well, finishing crisp and salty.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",20374
"97063","Packs a fruity punch, with masses of oranges, pineapples and Meyer lemons. Barrel fermentation and aging adds flavors of buttered toast, honey and butterscotch. Despite brisk acidity, lush and soft in style.","White","Chardonnay","US",97063
"11433","Oily in green apple and lime, this crowd-pleasing wine is supple and smooth, with touches of honey and vanilla, especially on the finish. With a lilting ripeness at its core, it will pair well with roasted chicken in herbs.","White","Chardonnay","US",11433
"72653","Cherry pie and cinnamon dominate the aromas. Sweet oaky influences like baking spices and brown sugar come out in the flavors, as a lush texture soothes the palate. This tastes mild in terms of acidity and tannins so it comes off as soft and almost sweet.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72653
"79782","A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot, this is generous in terms of its aromatic intensity and persistence. The wine opens with tones of espresso, dark berry, sweet spice and chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and opulent.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",79782
"17991","Notes of chopped star anise, sage, white spring flowers and Bartlett pear float out of the glass. The elegant palate offers yellow apple, white almond and citrus zest alongside a refined perlage. Bright acidity gives it a clean, quenching finish.","White","Glera","Italy",17991
"12188","Made from 60% Inzolia and 40% Catarratto, this thoroughly enjoyable wine delivers aromas of Mediterranean brush and citrus. The tangy sensations carry over to the palate with a blast of nectarine and lemon zest alongside savory saline flavors. Bright acidity gives a crisp finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",12188
"31781","This Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany offers up aromas of bell peppers, cedar wood and black currants. On the palate, this shows black cherry, raspberry and black pepper notes mingled with espresso. It finishes on a bitter note of unroasted coffee bean.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",31781
"4938","Dried herb, graphite and cedar form a cast of characters around a big powerful tannin concentration in this appellation wine. A bitter streak of tobacco plays games with sharper, crunchier aspects of cassis and clove.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4938
"77183","A consistent winner, this single-vineyard Chardonnay is barrel fermented in 100% new French oak, using wild yeast. The scents and flavors are exceptionally detailed, running from fresh clover into tree fruit, yeast and lots of toast. It has structure, grip and length.","White","Chardonnay","US",77183
"14752","Serious, concentrated fruit and structure on this grand cru Chablis. White fruits, laced with lime and rounded with some toast, all contribute to a powerful, complex wine.","White","Chardonnay","France",14752
"45772","Coffee and chocolate open the nose of this Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The wine is inky and well concentrated with thick, chewy density and plump cherry notes. It represents a straightforward combination of fruit and spice and would pair with most meat and pasta dishes.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",45772
"31557","The spritz on this Chenin Blanc gives this wine a sparkling appeal. The flavors of citrus fruits, green peas and vanilla are lovely.","White","Chenin Blanc","US",31557
"29402","This wine is made from 57% Petit Verdot (a variety of increasing interest, it seems) from mountain sites. An additional 29% Cabernet Franc and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon help soften its tastes of black licorice, leather and black currant, dotted by a dash of black olive. Opaque in color, it's savory and sizable in body without becoming overly concentrated. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",29402
"101843","A little reticent on the nose, but opens up generously in the mouth. It's off-dry (3% residual sugar), with a flavorful, round mix of citrus, tangerine and nectarine fruits. Full-bodied and lingering, it sails into a clean, tangy finish.","White","Riesling","US",101843
"71403","This wine is dominated by Touriga Nacional, which offers a backbone of dark tannins that gives it a firm structure and will allow it to age for many years. Produced in open stone lagares, it has richness and impressive opulence in black fruit tones that are cut by juicy acidity. Drink from 2022.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",71403
"6239","The nose is like citrus candy and applesauce, but it doesn't sing or pop like it could. The mouth is easygoing, with melon and grapefruit, but there's also a bit of unwelcome green bean. This wine fails to excite. —M.S. .","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",6239
"22487","A wonderfully funky notion of yeast precedes the full ripe yellow plum fruit on the nose and segues into a salty, spicy and peppery palate. Concentration and flavor reverberate with a lemony citrus zing. A great varietal expression of Grüner's dual spice and fruit nature in an elegant package with lots of drive.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",22487
"17826","Cooked-down blackberries take on pink peppercorn and new leather aromas in this Malbec hailing from the high-altitude vineyards of Colorado. The dark berry tones of the palate carry shards of graphite, with zippy red currant acidity keeping the full body and grainy tannins in check. It's a bit tight right now and should open up after 2016.","Red","Malbec","US",17826
"56958","A worthy followup to the 2007, perhaps not as immediately flamboyant, but a major Pinot Noir to age in the cellar. Shows flashy cherry and raspberry fruit, with tantalizingly rich spices and a perfect coating of sweet, smoky oak. Fine and delicious now, after decanting, and should develop over this decade.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56958
"14273","This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.","White","Chardonnay","US",14273
"2967","Concentrated, thick and dark in appearance, this lush Chianti Classico shows a dark ruby color and flavors of black cherry, cassis and cola. It feels a warm in the mouth, with a powerful finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",2967
"80153","Just 730 cases were made of this dry, lightly fruity offering. Melon and white peach flavors seem to be dusted with powdered sugar, though there is no sweetness in the finish, just dry flavors of wet stone. A good, every day, all-purpose white.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",80153
"54545","This is a blend of two vineyards, Pratt Vine Hill Road and Gap's Crown, enviable sources for both red and white grapes. The end result here shines in honey and a sublime hint of lemon candy. Bright, floral acidity lines a foundation of fresh tangerine and lime, finishing with an intensity of salty, spiced oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",54545
"49818","At the age of 2 1/2 years or so, this fresh Syrah is all about licorice, currant and blackberry fruit, with loads of black pepper. Tastes like it's right out of the fermenter, with firm tannins and bright acidity. Doesn't drink like an ager, so give it a good decant and drink soon.","Red","Syrah","US",49818
"48940","Minty and raisiny on the nose, with Port-like elements of dried fruit and high (15.0%) alcohol. Still, it shows the variety's trademark delicate structure and silky texture.","Red","Grenache","Australia",48940
"15442","Though two years older than the widely available Oregon bottling from Firesteed, this wine is almost its twin. Elegant and balanced, with light flavors of wild berry and an herbal underpinning.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15442
"25389","From grapes grown at the Ramal Arad vineyard located 500 meters above sea level. Pale straw in color, this is loaded with bright lime and pineapple notes with flavor accents of fresh cut grass and pear. Closes with an appropriately crisp and clean finish. Only 600 cases produced.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Israel",25389
"68389","Fragrant oak spice invites you to contemplate a mix of autumnal, ripe red fruit: plums perhaps, in a compote with strawberry. Mellow tannins come with echoes of clove and cinnamon. This friendly and soft red also works without food.","Red","Red Blend","Austria",68389
"1351","Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.","Red","Red Blend","US",1351
"94122","Tight and unyielding, with a dominating Band-Aid streak that does not disappear even after many hours of breathing time. There is some Walla Walla Syrah berry and loam character evident, and the vineyards are first rate (Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge), but the reductive, plastic flavor masks much of the fruit.","Red","Syrah","US",94122
"18916","The Chardonnay in this blend dominates, giving a rich, generous feel to the wine, full of ripe plum and peach flavors. The Arinto provides fresh acidity that is behind the warm fruits. Full and generous, it is a wine that needs to age; drink from the end of 2016.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",18916
"36239","Full-bodied, concentrated and richly textured, this is a succulent wine with refreshingly balanced oak. A floral note on the nose gives way to apricot and ginger-like spice, then finishes with a flourish of mouthwatering acidity. Drink now.","White","Viognier","France",36239
"45797","A big, strong Chardonnay with prominent buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla, and pineapple-orange jam flavors. Elaborate and flashy, but obviously made to appeal to the modern style. Drink up.","White","Chardonnay","US",45797
"13079","Full-bodied and richly textured, this more than delivers at its suggested retail price. Grilled plums, baking spices and mocha notes provide plenty of interest, finishing creamy and supple. Drink now–2020.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",13079
"72262","Soft and direct, this Pinot Noir offers easy flavors of cherries, currants, cola and spice, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72262
"1565","Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1565
"21316","This is an impressively endowed wine, but one that will have to rely on age for its complexity. Right now, its fruit (blackberries and cassis) is a bit simple upfront, then adds crisp acidity and firm tannins on the finish. Try in 2010.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",21316
"10619","It's a good thing Garagiste Festival cofounder Stewart McLennan caught the winemaking bug. This delicious bottling shows black currant, plum, blueberry, fennel, lavender, vanilla and gingerbread spice on the nose. Elegant purple-flower elements kick off the palate, and then come waves of blueberry-chiffon cake, blackberry juice, sea-salt caramel and a touch of vanilla.","Red","Syrah","US",10619
"15647","Named for a Margaret River subregion, Cape Mentelle's Wilyabrup is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It's structured and restrained on the palate, easily blending cherry, cedar, leather and earth notes in a truly claret-styled wine whose dry finish picks up hints of black tea. Drink now–2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Australia",15647
"36338","A tightly wrought, crisp texture gives the typical cool character of this appellation. This wine is full of white fruits layered with juicy acidity. Full in the mouth, it is delicious to drink although it will be better from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",36338
"69572","This earthy wine features aromas of truffle, ripe plum, leather and just a whiff of barnyard. The palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry and notes of baking spice alongside assertive tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",69572
"93233","A blend of 50% Grenache, 43% Syrah and 7% Cinsaut, this is very fresh and fruity--loaded with cherries--but also includes spice and earth complexities and a reasonable rich, creamy texture.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",93233
"93197","Complex earthy spicy savory flavors make this Grenache-based wine a great escape from simply fruity bottles. It's fragrant with smoke and black pepper in the aroma, filled with ripe plum, toffee and cardamom on the palate and has a full mouthfilling texture.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",93197
"44272","Difficult aromas of cigar ash and hickory are forceful and dominate the nose as a pair. This Tannat stamps across the palate with loud acidity and hard tannins. Toasty woody berry and plum flavors are abrupt on a rough finish.","Red","Tannat","Uruguay",44272
"96357","A concentrated and seductive Merlot that's perfect for folks who like 'em big, ripe and oaky. Mulled boysenberries and blueberry compote flood the nose and mouth, with lush notes of milk chocolate, blackcurrant liqueur and dark coffee spicing up the finish. Round and velvet-textured, with medium tannins.","Red","Merlot","Israel",96357
"79941","From Long Shadows, a rare, barrel-fermented Riesling. Sappy, tart, juicy and stylish, this is loaded with pear, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. The acidity is generous but softened up a bit by the extra oxygen from the fuder.","White","Riesling","US",79941
"44278","Pure Touriga Nacional, this is a crisp and fruity wine. Its red currants and light tannic structure give it shape and bring out the fruitiness that makes it immediately attractive. Ready to drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",44278
"32372","This taut, dry Grenache shows better structure than most California Grenaches, with its firm texture and bite of acidity. It shows the variety's cherry flavors. Tasty now, it's a good substitute for any medium-bodied wine, such as Zinfandel or Merlot.","Red","Grenache","US",32372
"7395","Using fruit mostly from the Bassi Ranch property he recently acquired, Mike Sinor delivers a bright, minerally wine, with aromas of scratched grapefruit skin, orange and peach juice, burned lemons, sea salt, ripe apples and nectarines and fresh-cut herbs. Flavors of salty, lime-juice nectarines emerge once sipped, with hints of butter and white flowers.","White","Chardonnay","US",7395
"62331","While this is a rich wine, it also has a more fruity character that brings out acidity and a streak of freshness. It's firm at the moment, reflecting a need for aging. Dense and full of berry fruits, it will be best drunk from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",62331
"72674","An unlikely white wine from a producer known more for old-vine Zinfandel, this full-bodied bottling shows the variety's more voluptuous side. Richly textured, the wine traffics in ripe peach and apricot, with a back note of almond.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",72674
"22409","This wine is full of red-berry flavors, fresh with acidity and a juicy texture. Lively and bright with a dancing, crisp character, it's a great apéritif-style wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",22409
"45910","From first sniff this exquisite wine grabs you and won't let go. Brambly berries, redolent with rich umami notes of spice and pine needle cascade into a wine densely packed with fruit and herbs. It lingers, opens and becomes more and more expressive, with soil-generated flavors of forest floor.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45910
"99479","Produced from bled-off Pinot Noir juice, this is a robust, high alcohol rosé. It was put through partial malolactic fermentation and offers candy strawberry flavors up front, without much depth.","Rosé","Rosé","US",99479
"73233","Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",73233
"64632","This wine comes from hillside vineyards in the far northern reaches of California's grape growing counties. It has an unusually dark color for Pinot. The ripe and fruity aromas are accented by oaky spices and flavors that bring out black-cherry and clove notes. It's full bodied, mouth-filling and flavorful.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64632
"101201","A heavy, roasted, charred nose gives this a dark outlook, and the bulky but smooth palate of black fruits and baked flavors does little to lessen the load. Feels good on the finish, although it tastes rather normal and a touch bitter. Round and fairly rich Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",101201
"5494","Clos Saint Landelin is a portion of the Vorbourg Grand Cru vineyard wholly owned by Muré. This rich wine is comfortably excessive, very full of spice and lychee flavors. Medium dry in character with a dry core, it is still young and could age. Drink from 2017.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",5494
"31887","Another stunning expression of the Monvigliero vineyard, it opens with an alluring Nebbiolo fragrance of ripe red berry, spice, leather, vineyard dust and balsamic notes. The structured and savory palate doles out rich red cherry, white pepper, cinnamon, licorice and Mediterranean herbs alongside firm but supple tannins and vibrant acidity. It's loaded with flavor and finesse. Drink after 2020.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",31887
"94237","This reedy smelling, jammy boxed wine is on the cusp of acceptability. It's gooey in feel, a bit fake and sugary in flavor, and sticky on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",94237
"585","This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.","Rosé","Rosé","France",585
"226","Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",226
"95705","This is a pleasant wine, with grapefruit and nectarine fruit, fresh but just a little flat through the midpalate. A good sipping wine, it's best served chilled and enjoyed while young.","White","Pinot Gris","US",95705
"4533","This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.","White","Chardonnay","US",4533
"35012","This white is overtaken by alcohol, giving it a sharp taste of weight and oak over slight wafts of sour apple and honey.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",35012
"15455","This 100% varietal wine, which saw 30 months of oak aging, is lightly aromatic with notes of cherry, anise, berry, vanilla and woodspice. It's quite restrained in feel—a very pretty wine—with elegant, sumptuous cherry flavors and a lingering finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15455
"94144","Far richer and more concentrated than the winery's regular '05 Pinot, this is a true reserve. It shows the same dryness and silky texture, but the spicy fruit is more intense in cherries and black raspberries, veering into cassis and anisette. Drink now for its extravagent flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94144
"79270","This is a dry, full-bodied deal of a wine, offering melon, papaya and zesty acidity around plenty of breadth and depth. Textured and luxurious, it finishes in ginger and Asian pear.","White","Chardonnay","US",79270
"53317","Cabernet Sauvignon (84%) takes the lead on this wine, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of high-toned herbs, wood spices, cocoa, cassis and a mixture of maraschino and dark cherries are followed by a full palate, overflowing with generous fruit flavors.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",53317
"69155","Here's a rich and smoky Chard with nice aromas and flavors of wood-grilled red apples with a caramel drizzle, peach pit and Key lime citrus. Solidly structured with good heft, a long finish and prominent acidity that keeps the wine from going over the edge and being too flabby. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",69155
"58300","Fattoria La Massa has produced an exciting wine that will appeal to those who love a big, opulent style. A blend of Sangiovese and Merlot, this boasts an inky appearance, and delivers enormous tones of tobacco, leather, coffee bean, blue flowers and lead pencil. It's soft and lush and certainly does not lack power or concentration.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58300
"96135","This Merlot is thin and common, but dry and drinkable, with cherry, cola and oak flavors. Gulp it down with anything you like.","Red","Merlot","US",96135
"66821","This wine is mostly Syrah (80%) with the rest made up of Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache. A pretty pale pink color, it's aromatically expressive with fruit-filled notes of strawberry and cherry. The palate contains the slightest suggestion of sweetness, with light-bodied orange-peel and tart fruit flavors that draw out on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",66821
"12088","This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. There's freshness to the fruit, with aromas of cherry and raspberry kissed by herb, clove and spice. The flavors are lush and palate-coating, with the tannins bringing a touch of astringency that hopefully will settle out with additional time in the bottle.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",12088
"103449","Spice and herbal berry aromas are true to the variety. Hard acidity creates roughness and scratch on the palate, while chocolaty, spiced plum flavors finish fiery at first then with herbal red-fruit flavors as it fades.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",103449
"60249","The alcohol is overwhelming here in an otherwise fragrant wine with strong aromas of cola spice. This Petit Verdot is medium-bodied and very much happy to display its 18 months spent in new American oak.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",60249
"89984","This warm Rosso starts with aromas of toast, woodland berries and cake spices. The juicy palate offers dense black cherry accented with notes of vanilla, mocha and clove alongside assertive tannins. Enjoy it soon.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",89984
"43483","A delicious fruit bomb, this has all the jammy goodness of blackberry syrup, with just enough tannin and acidity to keep it from being sweet. Smooth on the palate, it's full-bodied, uncomplicated and tasty.","Red","Red Blend","US",43483
"44457","Rich in heady cinnamon and aromatics of a perfumed rose in bloom this is a beautifully integrated, well-proportioned Pinot Noir, its black cherry and blackberry complemented by a depth of earth and mushroom and silky concentration of tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",44457
"4163","Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence.","Red","Malbec","US",4163
"4580","Soft layers of Chardonnay with aromas of vanilla cream and stone fruit are blended with fresh notes of citrus and passion fruit from the Vermentino element found within. The two varieties complement each other very well and produce an elegant wine for shellfish or seafood risotto.","White","White Blend","Italy",4580
"18486","There are big tannins in this wine along with the hallmark perfumes that are typical of the grape. Also typical is the one-dimensional character of the 100% Touriga Nacional. So it is rich, packed with black fruit but just missing an extra something. Drink the wine from 2020.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",18486
"59371","The production of Malbec at Three Rivers has risen dramatically, and the new vintage seems considerably lighter and less complex than it previously did. Fruity and forward, it shows black cherry and cola flavors, with a light streak of licorice.","Red","Malbec","US",59371
"89857","Obviously wood aged, with spice and toast flavors, this is a soft, black currant and berry flavored wine. It has light tannins that are already integrating with the fruit. Drink now and until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",89857
"69349","Blossomy and perfumed, yet reverberating with steel, acid and minerals, this stunning off-dry Riesling packs so much more power and punch than it's diminutive frame suggests. Sweet, pristine white peach and cherry flavors persist through a long, meandering finish. Drinks beautifully now, but is powerful enough to evolve well till at least 2025.","White","Riesling","Germany",69349
"60113","This is an attractive but focused wine with loads of juicy red plum guts, mashed raspberry and blackberry preserve flavors framing licorice and sweet spice backnotes. Robust and spicy with a strong cocoa flavored finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","South Africa",60113
"18377","Possibly too rich, this is a full, sumptuous wine. It has great weight, density, a smooth, wood-aged character that shows through the sweet plums. For what it is, a very rich wine that shows some pepper alcohol—it offers a juicy character and ageability. Drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",18377
"85665","This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food. It smells lightly spicy, tastes like raspberries and red cherries and has light tannins that add some needed grip.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85665

"44802","This Zin is made in the St. Francis style of dryness at the cost of extremely high alcohol. It's a good, lusty wine made for drinking with rich fare that will counter-balanced the heat. The flavors of blackberries, currants and peppery spices are very rich.","Red","Zinfandel","US",44802
"27203","This Blaufränkisch rosé is light, fruity and just off dry. It has attractive red-berry acidity and a very fresh character. Ready to drink now. Screwcap.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",27203
"55919","Zippy, fresh conference pear fruit with just a little edge of white pepper and zingy lemon zest plays on this linear, light-bodied but ultrafresh wine. An almost-weightless lightness means that the wine will do well as an enlivening apéritif.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",55919
"59672","This bold, densely flavored and impressively tannic wine is dry, very well structured and will be interesting to age until 2018–2019. It smells darkly fruity, smoky and spicy, and tastes like cranberry and black cherry, finishing with a firm tang of tannin. It will be best after 2018.","Red","Red Blend","US",59672
"37924","Ripe spicy berry aromas include welcome notes of wood grain and pencil eraser. This full tannic Tannat is a big load. Savory flavors of baked plum, tea, spice and chocolate finish with oak-driven complexity. Best from 2020–2026.","Red","Tannat","Uruguay",37924
"30397","Fruity and herbal, this fresh wine suggests ripe apples and white peaches. The crisp texture brings out the perfumed character of the fruit. The wine is ready to drink.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",30397
"45764","This barrel-fermented effort was not put through malolactic. It retains a very fresh, citrusy profile, a mix of rind and pulp flavors, with streaks of quinine and tonic. Good persistence, with the snap of fresh lime in the finish.","White","Viognier","US",45764
"49978","Sharp acidity and sugary sweet, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors give this wine a distinctly rustic feel. It shows the silkiness you want in a Pinot Noir, but is disappointing for the price.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49978
"33124","Slightly minty and grassy on the nose, and that mild green character persists. The palate is a bit clacky and acidic, yet the flavors evolve and ultimately rest at candied and medicinal. A touch biting but it tastes pretty good and it's decidedly not sour. A blend of 55% Monastrell with 25% Cabernet Savuignon and 20% Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",33124
"38744","With huge amounts of graphite, toast, wood grain, blueberry and blackberry aromas, this Cabernet Franc-led blend (with Malbec and Petit Verdot) is solid as granite, with a layered structure. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herbs dance together, while the finish is long, dark, minty and chocolaty. Best from 2016 through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",38744
"70454","This has soft red fruits along with a firm structure of tannins and acids. Shapely and balanced, this is ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",70454
"28957","Wood aging has imparted a slight bitterness to the ripe fruit. The juicy red-cherry flavor is melded into the firm tannins, and the finish is bright and round.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",28957
"91094","For some reason, Fritz held this wine back eight months later than their very fine 2009 Reserve Pinot. It's a solid wine, silky and pure, but it's a little too sweet in raspberries and cherries, like a granola candy bar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",91094
"54988","A floral wine, full of ripe black-cherry fruit and with a firm structure that sustains the wine. This cru wine is rich, still developing, still with enough tannins and acidity to allow it to age further. Drink this attractive wine from mid-2017.","Red","Gamay","France",54988
"40436","This is a pretty wine, forward and fruit-driven, with orange-juice highlights around cherry fruit. It's as fresh and flavorful as a Cru Beaujolais, ready for immediate enjoyment and best consumed sometime this decade.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40436
"4732","Brilliant strawberry and raspberry aromas, bright and effusive fruit flavors, and a sense of freshness and purity make this wine from one of El Dorado County's oldest wineries a pleasure to drink. It's full bodied, has a smooth texture, mild tannins and a lingering finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",4732
"64324","This straightforward Barbaresco opens with a pretty nose of wild rose, crushed red berry and balsamic notes. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, licorice and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",64324

"40493","A blend of Carricante and Catarratto planted in high-altitude vineyards, this linear vibrant white offers delicate but enticing scents of Spanish broom, jasmine and orchard fruit. The bright delicious palate doles out creamy yellow apple, green pear and chopped mint while a mineral note underscores the finish. It's loaded with finesse.","White","White Blend","Italy",40493
"26740","A solid Pinot Noir, silky and rich in raspberry, cherry and smoky oak flavors. Notable for its silky texture and balancing acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now and over the next few years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26740
"59042","Hard tannins, probably from the grape skins, mark this wine, the kind you usually don't find in a Syrah, especially one from a warm climate like Alexander Valley. Beyond the lockdown astringency, you'll find lush blackberry and cocoa flavors, but they may not last long enough for the wine to age.","Red","Syrah","US",59042
"46423","From the producer's estate ranch, a coveted source of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a 100% stainless-steel wine, low in ripeness, that's enthusiastic in watermelon, cherry and strawberry, smelling like summer. Dark pink-red in color, it's crisp, light, tangy in acidity and everything you want in a quaffing wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46423
"78008","A lovely, fragrant lift of honeysuckle and grape rises from the glass in this wine. The palate is light and dry—still floral yet tinged with lemony freshness. Easy and bright like a summer breeze.","White","White Blend","Austria",78008
"98081","Here is a lively, buoyant wine that affords room for a wide array of aromatic nuances. Apple, almond, cherry cobbler and penetrating black tar are foreground notes with red fruit and sweet vanilla as soft background shadings. The intensity is as remarkable as its persistency.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",98081
"37370","Situated at the mouth of the Pinhão river in the heart of the Douro region, this vineyard has produced a warm, ripe, finely fruity wine. It comes from some of the oldest parcels of the vineyard and is fermented in old open stone fermenters. The wood aging has added to its richness. Drink this wine from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",37370
"63314","A creamy, unctuous white with a tease of waxy apple, cheese rind and tropical pear, this fuller-bodied expression of the grape takes on generous layers of caramel and ginger as it goes. It finishes in a long, lingering celebration of brioche and allspice.","White","Chardonnay","US",63314
"56722","Similar in every respect to the '09 vintage, a softly ripe wine that's drinkable now despite Petite Sirah's firm tannins. It's very delicious, showing candied blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",56722
"7841","Dry and spicy up front, with aromas of herbed raspberry and sandalwood. The palate is juicy and structured, with toasty, spicy plum and berry flavors and good zest. Finishes toasty, with a bit of chocolaty richness. Fresh, ripe and well oaked.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",7841
"31356","This is a second wine of Château Tournelles. Soft and generously ripe, it has attractive tannins that just give the bright fruit a support. The wine, a blend of Bordeaux grapes typical of this appellation, is ready to drink.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",31356
"100889","This wine boasts a lot of character and evolution, and is layered and complex. The bouquet leads with aromas of hay, beeswax, orange oil, wood-grilled apple and sweet spice. Medium weight, but with ample acidity to keep it balanced, rich fruit flavors are accented by notes of toast and wood that carry through the long finish. It's drinking perfectly now, but should last well through 2015.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",100889
"90170","Bold and full bodied, this opens with rather subtle aromas of chopped herb, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of star anise. The ripe palate is more expressive, doling out black raspberry, juicy morello cherry and baking spice set against a backbone of noble tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",90170
"96960","Violet, boysenberry, sandalwood and pencil lead converge on this nose of this 72% Cabernet Sauvignon bottling, which is boosted by 25% Sangiovese and 3% Petite Sirah. The palate is loaded with interesting flavors, from dried raspberry to crushed wild chaparral and black rocks.","Red","Red Blend","US",96960
"98123","Three-quarters of this wine was whole-cluster fermented, and spent 18 months in one-third new oak. Blending the winery's three best barrels of the vintage, it's a spicy, edgy wine which marries bitter herbs to black cherry and chocolate components. Firm and muscular, young and powerful, it should be cellared for a few years. Drink 2020–2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98123
"91302","Candied fruit, prune and apricot notes open the bouquet of this deep, dark wine. The palate picks up speed thanks to the savory tones of cured meat and barbecue smoke. A much-needed point of acidity on the finish pulls the wine nicely together.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",91302
"104915","From this well-known Carneros vineyard comes this lighter lemon-lime SB with mixed citrus flavors and intense acidity. It's a medium-weight wine with a rather short pineapple finish. It has some creaminess to the mouthfeel, but overall it just doesn't ring the right bells to rate higher. Made by Mia Klein of Etude fame.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",104915
"47572","This is a fragrant, sinewy wine. Mixed herbs twine around cranberry and raspberry fruit, while the palate builds in weight and flesh in the glass. Give it until 2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",47572
"69919","An elegant and well-balanced Syrah, initial scents of red cherry and brambly berry lead into more refined notes of cola spice, game, leather and a touch of sweet smoke. The palate is smooth and easy, with silky tannins that are surprisingly approachable and red cherry and berry flavors that are bright and refreshing. Final hits of white pepper and cured game grace the medium-length finish.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",69919
"81059","Lemon-lime soda, chalk and gin-and-tonic cocktail elements power the nose on this zesty, medium-sweet bottling. The mouthfeel is soft, with lime juice and quinine cutting the ripe orange-syrup notes.","White","Riesling","US",81059
"68266","Red cherry and currant mix with sweet sawdust and anise-spiced gum on the nose. Medium-bodied, with a plush feel, juicy red fruit flavors pervade on the palate. Light tannins make this an easy sipper—enjoy alone or with lighter proteins.","Red","Tempranillo","US",68266
"35743","Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020.","Red","Zinfandel","US",35743
"33477","Slightly sour red plum, red cherry, tar and dust show on the nose of this simple wine. More tar and rubber flavors arise on the palate, where light red fruit also emerges.","Red","Red Blend","US",33477
"32300","Licorice, schist, wild herbs and spicy berry fruit form an alluring bouquet. The palate is jammy but firm, with mouthfilling tannins and schisty flavors of blackberry that come with a fine herbal streak. Meaty and tannic but balanced and deep; a classy taste of Priorat to drink now through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",32300
"76705","Named for the Entav clone, this is an earthy, herbal and dense 100% Cabernet Franc, hard to find in the Napa Valley and a special calling of this producer. Black plum, currant and a sense of restraint rise above the fray in this wine, which remains sizable in tannins and tight on the finish, suggesting time in the cellar, through 2021.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",76705
"66932","This is an enormously rich, extracted wine, that's vast in cherries, blackberries, currants, chocolate and oak flavors. Yet it has balancing acidity and tannins. Best now and over the next few years, especially a great barbecued steak or leg of lamb.","Red","Syrah","US",66932
"83742","A big mouth-filling offering with lots of oak/cedar and coffee/mocha shadings. Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins. It's the best Cabernet we've ever tasted from this Kosher winery, and it should improve over the next two to four years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",83742
"33087","Vines close to the east coast of Corsica give this bright, light and fruity wine. Crisp acidity is fleshed out with creamed apple and pear fruit. The wine is delicious to drink now.","White","White Blend","France",33087
"99818","This is a firm wine that is structured with dense tannins. At the same time, its ripe black fruits and acidity promise a generous rich future. From a walled vineyard, once belonging to the local bishop, the wine is set for some long-term aging. Drink from 2023.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",99818
"44122","This full-bodied and extroverted wine has become one of Lodi's best-selling. It has an unusually deep color plus lavish aromas of ripe fruit, maple syrup, and milk chocolate. Rich, nearly sweet fruit flavors suggest boysenberry jam.","Red","Zinfandel","US",44122
"104852","This is a big, tough, tight and somewhat puzzling Pinot Noir. It's bone dry, moderate in alcohol and tart in acidity, with sour red cherry, cranberry, Dr. Pepper cola and new French oak flavors. It's hard and rude right now, although its inherent elegance shines through. The question is ageability. Give it until 2018 and see what it's doing.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104852
"62649","A bit too soft and sweet for Zinfandel, but it sure is delicious in berry fruit, chocolate, pepper and herb flavors. Drink now with barbecue.","Red","Zinfandel","US",62649
"44212","Winemaker J. P. Valot, who is from Argentina, shows a confident touch with this grape. Mixed fruit flavors of red plum, golden raisin and fig bring a unique character to this well-balanced wine. Solid through the midpalate, it carries into a generous, lightly chocolaty finish.","Red","Malbec","US",44212
"26592","Though lightly colored, this is a powerful Pinot Noir from the estate vineyard of Norman Beko. He cold-soaks the fruit and ferments with native yeasts to deliver aromas of raspberry, pine and wet slate. The flavors range from pomegranate to violet to red rose to a fruit punch that lingers a long time thanks to a nice acidic lift.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26592
"67581","This is a well-balanced Petite Sirah, with chewy but proportionate tannins, a broadly fruity, black cherry core and nuanced highlights of apricot. The finish does a quick fade.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",67581
"59896","Stillwater Creek, Conner Lee and Bacchus vineyards provided the fruit for this young, sappy and rich Syrah. It captures the varietal character of the grape, especially as expressed in Washington State. Inviting aromas of berries and chocolate, bright and fresh, lead into brambly red fruits, umami-soaked mushrooms and moist earth.","Red","Syrah","US",59896
"33055","There's a reason why this finessed bottling is one of Sicily's most iconic whites. It doles out juicy yellow apple, mature pear, white grapefruit, yellow peach and tropical fruit accented by notes of vanilla and hazelnut, with fresh acidity. Subtle oak adds complexity and structure.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",33055
"1179","2014 proves another banner year for this delightful blend of Sémillon from Monte Rosso Vineyard, Muscadelle from Pagani Ranch and Palomino and Muscadelle from Saitone Ranch. High-toned in tart, refreshing acidity, it offers hints of vanilla biscuit with its lime, apple and melon flavors, lingering in memory for days.","White","White Blend","US",1179
"37281","A fruity, crisp and herbaceous blend of Loin de l'oeil and Mauzac, this lively wine also shows some richness. Full of green and citrus fruits, it is finished with a light minerality and acidity. Drink from 2015.","White","White Blend","France",37281
"9056","Berry, plum and dusty earth aromas control the nose on this full-flavored wine. In the mouth, this offers weight but good framing and edging. Flavors of ripe red fruits fall into the tutti-frutti category, while creamy oak and spice notes spill onto a medium-long finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",9056
"56396","Stewed prune aromas carry over to the palate, along with raw sour cherry, camphor and espresso notes. It's a tight and astringent wine with bracing tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",56396
"100674","An off-dry character sets the scene for this concentrated, already balanced wine. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope. It gives exceptional ripeness, as here, a warm and full-bodied wine with great swathes of fruitiness. Drink from 2017.","White","Pinot Gris","France",100674
"27259","Aromas of mature berry, tilled soil and a whiff of dark spice unfold on this young red. The vibrant, straightforward palate offers easy-drinking pleasure, doling out juicy wild cherry and star anise alongside loose knit, glossy tannins and bright acidity.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",27259
"92650","Toasted oak, coffee and vanilla lead the nose and carry over to the palate along with dense cherry extract and espresso. Raspy wood tannins leave an astringent, abrupt finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",92650

"69517","Tasted with over a decade of bottle aging, this late-release Spätlese is a heart-stopper. The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors. Intonations of maturity show in glimpses of creamy cashew, dried mushroom and crushed rock that extend from nose to finish. It should maintain its spry, electric feel from now through 2021 at least.","White","Riesling","Germany",69517
"22483","There's a lot to love in this bottling for those who enjoy cooler-climate Syrah. But the tons of cracked black pepper, asphalt and gamy funk meet with enough elderberry and lavender to appeal to others as well. The palate packs a wide array of flavors, from anise to lavender to cracked peppercorn, with savory tar, dried elderberry and even some elderflower showing as well.","Red","Syrah","US",22483
"82123","The traditional grapes of Valpolicella (Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara) are blended with 10% Barbera, giving this an added touch of crisp acidity. The simple nose shows notes of wild berry, toasted almond and cola.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",82123
"36505","This opens with smoky, almost smudgy and intriguing notes of yeast. Underneath, however, there is a wealth of green pear and lemon zest. The palate is uncommonly spicy: white pepper, fresh yeast and crushed aromatic kitchen herbs leave a lasting, salty tang that really hits you There is freshness and concentration and echoing brininess on the long finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",36505
"49146","Clean lines of nectarine, lemon blossom, orange sorbet and wet rock show on the lovely nose of this bottling from Trey Fletcher. Boisterous energy and a chalky grip power the palate, where citrus freshness dominates, and the acidity is powerful but not overblown. It will age with beauty and grace. Drink 2018–2035.","White","Chardonnay","US",49146
"101011","Intense aromas of thyme, white spring flower, citrus and exotic fruit lead the nose. On the soft palate, a frothy mousse frames white grapefruit, sage, apricot and yellow peach. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors.","White","Moscato","Italy",101011
"53938","Familiar varietal aromas of lychee and scented candle come with a hint of petrol. Punchy and crisp in feel, this tastes of garden variety lemon-lime, banana and lychee. A crisp but rudimentary finish closes things out.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",53938
"16305","This is an elegant, focused wine that shows balanced aromas of fruit and spice, with touches of espresso and tobacco in the background. Its personality is austere and masculine, with natural heft and richness.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",16305
"15607","This is a big but balanced expression of Cabernet that is ready to drink now. Layers of black cherry, caramel, vanilla, smoke and crushed black rocks show on the lavish nose. The palate's chalky texture is immediately apparent, with vibrant acidity that carries forth a rich crème de cassis flavor and finishes on roasted coffee and milk chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15607
"37768","Comes out of the chute a bit tarry and rubbery, but seems to come around with some time in the glass, offering a lush, dense texture and flavors of coffee and black olive that finally show some berry shadings on the finish.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",37768
"47049","This is the rarest of all finds: a high-quality Pinot Noir at an everyday price. It's medium bodied and crisp, with ample complexity that blends smoke, cedar, cola and black cherry notes. With its reasonably firm finish, it might be interesting to try in another year or two, although it's ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",47049
"40700","The dazzling cherry-rhubarb character starts in the aroma, expands on the palate and cruises through the finish, making this a memorable wine. In a no-nonsense way it serves up vivid, bracing flavors with virtually no oaky notes while displaying lively tannins and great acidity. Tempting to drink now but will improve through at least 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",40700
"47880","Opaque and almost black in the glass, this young bottling shows savory aromas of roasted meat, crushed slate, dark chocolate, fresh thyme and green peppercorns. Ripe black fruit flavors leap from the glass, bringing layers of thyme, pepper and Indian spice, all framed by bright acidity. Ready to enjoy now.","Red","Syrah","US",47880
"77175","This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec and Petit Verdot in supporting roles. The voluptuous nose introduces a riot of blue and purple fruit flavors—a comingling of berries and plums. Streaks of fresh herb, mocha and cacao enter gracefully, leading onto the rich, deep and lusciously long finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",77175
"92092","Campfire smoke presents a hearty, full-throttled introduction to this rugged wine, grippy, with offerings of red and black berry layered against tar and dark chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",92092
"42792","Faint cranberry and incense aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more flavors, including coffee, black tar, pomegranate and peppercorns.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",42792
"89993","This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah, with a core of blueberry and cocoa. It's super-smooth and quite easy to sip and enjoy. But apart from that, and the seductive coffee/mocha flavors that run rampant through the finish, it shows little of the depth and complexity that Washington Cabernet can display. Drink 2017–2019.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89993
"35655","Prune is the most distinct aroma on a generic yet ripe nose. This feels shearing and high in acidity, while raspberry flavors fold in sharp tartaric notes. Short on the finish, as might be expected.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",35655
"59916","This is a rich, concentrated while also fruity wine. With its solid tannins that are finely integrated into the rich, black plum fruit flavors, it is already a very fine wine and presently drinkable; however, another year would not hurt, so best to savor this dense blend of Alicante Bouschet, Petit Verdot and Syrah after 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",59916
"61416","A blend of 57% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Syrah, this opens with a sweetly spiced bouquet of red and purple fruits. The medium weight midpalate brings tart plum and cherry flavors, plentiful acidity and moderate, balanced tannins. Drink now through 2020.","Red","Red Blend","US",61416
"26879","Super-rich, this is an atypical wine, spice rather than fruit dominating. So enjoy the cinnamon, vanilla and cream flavors—the acidity is a minor element. The finish has exotic, spice-laden character. Screwcap.","White","Riesling","Austria",26879
"72762","Predominantly Grenache, with smaller amounts of Shiraz and Mourvèdre, but the aromas reflect the Mourvèdre's tendency toward dark fruit and tree bark. The flavors show some redder fruit flavors—raspberries—as well as touches of caramel and rhubarb, and this slightly syrupy wine finishes with a tangy edge. It's a little eccentric in style and flavor profile, but savory and tasty in its own way—and a relative bargain.","Red","G-S-M","Australia",72762
"62973","This wine, produced from 80-year-old vines on the Dupuy family's property, is firm and dense. It has new wood aging that shows in the juicy eucalyptus flavors and touches of mint. The youthful blackberry fruits and the structure show the wine has considerable aging potential. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",62973
"48157","A of blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of oak, sawdust, espresso and black fruit. The palate shows overripe cherry, oak extract and sweet, sugary vanilla alongside astringent wood tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",48157
"68128","This broad, open, tongue-tickling wine comes on quickly with a blast of chocolate and cherries. Highlighted with an underpinning of tart raspberry jam, it's immediately accessible and utterly delicious. A hint of caramel crunch provides the perfect finale to this yum-fest of a wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",68128
"1971","This has a soft texture that just allows room for some crisp apple flavors. Otherwise, it is a smooth rounded wine. Its fruitiness and its acidity are part and parcel of this ripe wine. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",1971
"37350","Licorice, dark berry, toast and orange-peel aromas take shape in the glass and carry over to the palate, along with grilled herb, mocha and cinnamon. Firm, polished tannins provide balance and support while a mineral vein drives the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",37350
"13734","Always the firm's showstopper and one of the best expressions of this celebrated vineyard, the 2013 doesn't disappoint. It opens with alluring scents of wild red berry, Alpine herb, truffle, graphite and new leather while the dazzling palate boasts Marasca cherry, clove, cinnamon, tobacco and a balsamic note. It already shows remarkable finesse and complexity but still needs years to develop to its full and impressive potential. Drink from 2025 through 2050.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",13734
"22630","An easy to drink white wine, of a style increasingly popular. It's unoaked, allowing pure citrus, honey and spice flavors to star. Brisk Edna Valley acids and minerals make the mouthfeel lively.","White","Albariño","US",22630
"92195","Showing the superb structure of the vintage and the spectacular way this great vineyard can ripen Pinot Noir, this polished wine is not only delicious from the get-go, but ageable. Floods the mouth with lush black cherry, red currant, cola, sweet oak, anise, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on. A memorable wine that should slowly gather steam and peak by 2011, then begin a long, steady arc downward.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92195
"55577","With pert acidity and candied pineapple and lemon flavors, this wine has the taste of a sweet-and-sour cough drop. It straddles the line between dry and off-dry.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",55577
"66393","The wine is fruity with acidity and just a touch of wood aging. It is bright with red currants and a lively bright character. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",66393
"89814","This has a well-aged aroma plus tangy raspberry and cranberry flavors. It offers good balance between flavor, crispness and firm tannins. Most of all, it conveys a personality that mirrors this grape variety's Italian roots. It's dry, medium bodied and slightly astringent in texture.","Red","Sangiovese","US",89814
"80223","Give it air time and it'll give back floral raspberry and cherry aromas in front of a racy, forward-style palate that's got cherry and red plum flavors and integrated spice. Not overbearing; clean and dry on the finish. Atypical for a Carmenère-led prestige wine; it's more streamlined and red in character.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",80223
"50630","The Shea Vineyard, replanted during the 1990s due to phylloxera, is returning to its old form. Round and fresh fruit flavors, lightly toasty, and showing a dusting of powdered sugar, craft a fruity wine with a raspberry pastry character. Lovely for near-term enjoyment.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50630
"87009","Intense aromas of mature stone fruit, apricot, honeysuckle and jasmine almost jump out of the glass. The vibrant, lightly foaming palate doles out juicy yellow peach, fresh apricot and a hint of sage alongside crisp acidity.","White","Moscato","Italy",87009
"83605","Coming from a vineyard better known for its reds, this wine is a field blend of eight clones of the variety. It offers aromas of white grapefruit, oyster shells and whiffs of tropical fruit. Flavors are fleshy in feel while retaining tart, citric acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",83605
"92987","Dr. Pepper, black plum and poppy-seed aromas show on this bottling by Ken Brown, who planted the first Syrah in Santa Barbara County in 1978. The soft palate offers cola, candied black cherry and violet flavors, lacking many of the gamy qualities found in the region.","Red","Syrah","US",92987
"72396","Light daffodil aromas mix with Key lime pie, soft pear flesh, pressed tuberose and apple blossoms on the nose of this relatively complex wine from an often simplistic grape. There is decent grip on the palate, with flavors of dried pome fruit, pencil lead minerality and a lemony tang.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",72396
"45933","A beautiful wine that does just what you want in a Merlot. It's soft, velvety and luscious to drink now, but it's far from simple. Shows intricate cherry-berry, mocha, licorice, chocolate and oak flavors that go long on the finish. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","US",45933
"73637","Quite raisiny, with an overweight personality conveyed through the nose. The palate is tannic, with black cherry and cola flavors thickened up by a full dose of raisin. Very sweet on the finish, but also hard and baked. Still reasonably good but it's less well balanced than in previous vintages.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",73637
"91865","Soft, overoaked and clumsy, with sweet vanilla, caramel and buttered toast dominating.","White","Chardonnay","US",91865
"1100","Deep penetrating sour-cherry and raspberry flavors are balanced against brisk blood-orange acidity in this dry Pinot Noir rosé. Full bodied and slightly silky on the palate, it's a satisfyingly mouthfilling but invigorating wine to enjoy now through the fall months.","Rosé","Rosé","US",1100
"52381","High toned red fruit, cola, and baking spice notes are revealed after some vigorous swirling in this initially shy wine. Tightly wound tannins on the palate are balanced by a good lick of acidity and fairly prominent oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",52381
"2302","From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",2302
"34039","This is an earthy, minty, tart and taut wine, worthy of its appellation. It offers light-bodied notions of black tea, cranberry and rhubarb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",34039
"55669","Beautiful, brooding and with a bit of an edge, the Gravel Hill starts with aromas of smoke, cloves, black currant and pepper, leading into a layered, savory array of rich spice and black fruit. Elegant but assertive, the wine has a distinctive South African character, with a touch of Old World minerality and restraint.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",55669
"62003","This offers a pleasing intermix of fruit and spice, from blackberry and plum to Cab-like cassis. Juicy, mouthfilling and structured, it has a finish all about cinnamon and peppercorns.","Red","Zinfandel","US",62003
"58040","An unusual and inviting lemongrass aroma and flavor go well with a buttery and vibrant texture in this medium-bodied and almost sweet wine. Blended from Sémillon, Chardonnay and four other grapes, it makes a nice change of pace.","White","White Blend","US",58040
"8817","The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering. Mocha-kissed tannins play nicely with black and red berry fruit, providing a structure built to age, through 2021.","Red","Syrah","US",8817
"90465","This is a wonderful, easy-drinking Orvieto that would pair with seafood, vegetables or spicy Asian foods. It shows pristine aromas of citrus, stone fruit and freshly picked garden herb.","White","White Blend","Italy",90465
"22082","The nose of this bottling from actress Challen Cates impresses with its spicy cherry, mulberry, juniper and mace notes. The palate is silky in texture and extremely well integrated, long-lasting and layered, with shiitake mushroom, forest floor, red cherry and earthy loam flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",22082
"28119","Coconut and vanilla are the lead aromas, while there's leather and ripe berry and cassis below the surface. Feels tight, juicy and prickly, with zesty acidity and typical Chilean Cabernet flavors of leafy berry, earth, tobacco and oaky vanilla. Feels snappy and tight as it finishes with oaky, leafy flavors.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",28119
"16579","This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine from the producer's well-known property, sparkling in acidity despite its intensity of weight and length. Blackberry and nutmeg sit atop a soft integration of tannin and oak. Drink now through 2020.","Red","Zinfandel","US",16579
"26615","This is the flagship wine from the mini-empire (now comprising five properties) that is controlled by Comte Stephan von Niepperg. He has made a modern, wood dominated wine, with rich, concentrated black fruits. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, lacking a sense of the usual grace of this estate, although the ripeness of the wine does compensate.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26615
"77384","Strongly herbal while also rich, this tangy, zesty wine shows no concessions in its expression of Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe and full of green plum and gooseberry flavors, it's smooth and ready to drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",77384
"72010","This has aromas of oak, grilled herb, dried porcini mushroom, a note of stewed fruit and camphor. The straightforward palate shows leather, grilled herb, toast and red cherry alongside firm seasoned tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",72010
"32172","Still very closed up, this is going to be a classic. Its tannins are already balanced to the immense juicy fruits and dark wood flavors that bring out spiciness. It's powerful while not over the top, showing elegance at the same time as an opulent texture. Give this gorgeous wine until 2018.","Red","Malbec","France",32172
"35078","Made from organically farmed grapes, this bright blend of Sangiovese (90%) and Merlot (10%) starts with aromas of violet, iris and freshly tilled soil. The lively palate delivers black cherry and raspberry flavors, while notes of cinnamon-spice add some depth. It's enjoyable now, but hold until 2016–2017 to round out.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",35078
"21741","This long-aged (42 months) vintage Cava opens with a whiff of exotic bath soap along with more familiar apple and pear scents. There's yeasty, creamy weight to the palate and flavors of fresh-baked bread, spent yeast and papaya. Mild lees and cream notes grace the finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",21741
"84365","This wine is rich, with generous black plum and berry fruits. It has a structure that is full, ripe and that will sustain the fruitiness of the wine over many years. The sensation is of velvet, with some force behind it. This remarkable wine will develop well over the medium term and then age for many years. Drink from 2022.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",84365
"5884","Ripe cherry and luscious watermelon aromas waft from this summery, fresh wine. It's dry on the palate but concentrated, with bright cherry and berry flavors. Round and lush yet briskly balanced, it's a great summer quaffer at a fantastic price.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5884
"3382","The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",3382
"94463","Fire up the barbecue and grill a steak to pair with this rich, ripe, lusty blend. Comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it's enormously extracted with flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate and bacon. The tannins are strong, but soft acidity helps make them drinkable now.","Red","Red Blend","US",94463
"97617","Fresh cherry and plum aromas are basic and easy, with a medicinal side note. This Garnacha-Carignan-Cabernet blend is grabby and pulling. Plum, raspberry and tomato flavors finish with a reprise of rubbery tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",97617
"69177","Aromas of Dr Pepper, black-cherry cola syrup, chopped lavender candies and a touch of leather show on the intriguing, distinct nose from this historic property. The cola character plays heavily into the palate, where condensed purple flower, blackberry, black tea and licorice flavors also abound.","Red","Grenache","US",69177
"9108","Plummy, ripe, beginning to oxidize. Ready to drink right now, it's got a leafy, tomato flavor to it. Unusual.","Red","Zinfandel","US",9108
"26826","A black currant-flavored wine, it initially feels light and then broadens to give black currant and spice flavors. The tannins give a very dry character, leaving the fruit to struggle. Not for long-term aging; drink from 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26826
"40098","This medium-bodied Cabernet offers a balanced blend of earth and mixed berries. Some dusty tannins are present, but come across as fine in texture, suitably framing the long, crisp finish. Drink now–2020.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",40098
"71600","Quite hard and almost impenetrable at first, this slowly opens to give a glimpse of compact, dried blueberry fruit and a dash of dark chocolate. The tannins are hard and herbal also. Aeration will help.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",71600
"103174","A massively oaked and dry wine, this has generous tannins that are almost overwhelming. Dense blackberry and cedar, with an accent of pencil lead, cut through the clutter, ending in a swordplay of leather and tobacco.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103174
"73563","A lean wine with green fruit flavors, this is made drinkable by its balance between fruit and the dry core of tannins. The wine should be drunk now.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",73563
"41998","Notes of lemon and cherry blossom brighten tones of crushed stone and slate on this semi-dry Riesling. Juicy and ripe with flavors of melon and white peach, it's intensely fruity and floral but honed with reverberating minerality on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",41998
"33392","This rosé is a field blend of Mourvèdre and Grenache. A very pretty pale-peach color, the aromas bring pleasing notes of herb, spice, strawberry, passion fruit and mineral. The flavors are dry and full in feel, showing weight and intensity but still a sense of lightness.","Rosé","Rosé","US",33392
"49347","While unoaked, this tropical swirl of mango, guava and pineapple is unabashedly rich in style. Decadent caramel and butterscotch notes are a bit on the confected side but clean up tidily against a streak of sunny lemon on the mid palate. Drink through 2019.","White","Chardonnay","US",49347
"9453","A fine wine that shows the complexity and volume of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The wine is thoroughly dry and fairly full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, offering rich black cherry, currant and mineral flavors. Its depth and sturdy tannins suggest cellaring for 5–6 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9453
"48554","Much better than the watery 2004, this wine still seems a bit light and thin for its Reserve status. It's got some tart, sharp flavors of wild blackberry, but the herbal flavors suggest unripe grapes.","Red","Syrah","US",48554
"79950","Black-cherry fruit comes wreathed in light smoke, with a streak of root beer adding to the flavor. This is a wine of medium weight and concentration, with hints of fennel throughout.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",79950
"22423","The lees and peach aromas are quite light considering the variety. The stone-fruit flavors are reserved and pleasant, but the variety seems to get lost.","White","Viognier","US",22423
"28409","As Virginia wines can sometimes struggle with acid retention, wines made using naturally high-acid varieties like Tannat are making waves. This bottling of 100% Tannat has aromas of dark cherry, pain grillé and savory spice, with a grilled portobello underpinning. Assertive, strapping tannins lay the foundation, and the uplifting acids add cut. Only 70 cases produced.","Red","Tannat","US",28409
"49333","A 65-35 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bold, opulent and elaborate. This expression has perfumed notes of incense and exotic spice, lavished over tones of ripe cherry and blackberry.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",49333
"102179","Corvo's entry-level Nero d'Avola opens with a bright, lean appearance and sharp berry tones with almond and cassis. It's a bit lean but fresh.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",102179
"57396","Chris Gorman's “Devil” project includes this juicy, fruity red blend, based mostly upon Bordeaux grapes. The forward cherry-berry flavors push through with some power into a chocolate-malted explosion with peppery highlights.","Red","Red Blend","US",57396
"17805","This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins. Hints of oak smoke and caramel waft over the ripe plum aromas. The flavors go to dark cherries and coffee, the texture is attractively astringent from tannins, and the finish carries a little bite. Well done but not overdone.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",17805
"97015","This wine, named after a swarm of bees, comes from a small region in the center of the larger Côtes de Provence. From high-altitude vineyards in a state park, it is cool while keeping plenty of richness. The acidity and the red-currant fruits dominate this attractive, ready-to-drink wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",97015
"37450","Tannat at its most expressive, this wine boasts dense tannins that roll deeply around the wine. But the fruit is of such an intensity that it keeps up a fine equilibrium. It is a seamless, impressive wine, projecting its power easily.","Red","Tannat","France",37450
"51252","The color of slightly faded garnet, this wine has a bouquet of cassis and green pepper. Chalky tannins create a backdrop for flavors of tart cherry, lingonberry, bell pepper and petrol that make promises to the taste buds but fall short of delivering.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Israel",51252
"5769","With a light prickle on the tongue, this is a fresh and fruity wine that has sweetness balanced by a citric edge. It's crisp and ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",5769
"106166","A little sharp and awkward in the mouth, with some green flavors leading to a tart finish. There are enough berry, cherry and oak flavors to make the wine interesting. Shows a classy dryness, but doesn't seem to have the balance to age. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",106166
"97100","A vein of lime skin and granite lingers throughout this lithe, focused wine. White grapefruit flavors penetrate the palate, along with accents of saffron and sugar cookie that dart playfully along the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",97100
"32577","So ripe and rich in fruit, you won't even notice the absence of oak. The grapes come mostly from Lodi, with a touch of Monterey. Brightened with crisp acidity, the flavors are of spicy, zesty tangerines and vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",32577
"49067","Cherry, cassis and plum aromas are clean as polished glass. This feels fruity and firm, with good flow. Peppery blackberry and minerally cassis are the lead flavors, whiile the finish brings schisty minerality and integrated but noted acidity. Best from 2016–2019.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",49067
"44909","Slightly reduced but still balanced enough to give off a positive early impression. The wine is sweet, almost syrupy, but it's that same ripeness that gives it more oomph and richness than most under-$10 wines. Finishes baked and almost stewy, but if you get at it early it should deliver all the black fruit and size one can expect from a value-priced offering.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",44909
"66576","Apricot, damask rose and earth frame this vivacious Gewurztraminer that benefits from 2014's verve. The palate comes with some of the characteristic viscosity but the zest of orange and lemon peel balances this out beautifully, creating a lovely, refreshing arc.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",66576
"68592","Here's a luminous and vibrant rosato from Sicily with a saturated pink color and thick aromas of ripe raspberry and forest fruit. It has good acidity and enough heft and density in the mouth to pair with pasta or fish soup.","Rosé","Rosé","Italy",68592
"90052","A heavily oaked wine that needs time for the toast to integrate. It does have the black fruit structure to back it up, so expect this complex wine to develop pleasurably over the next 5–6 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",90052
"87884","The nose gives little away but the palate comes in with the fruity pleasant ease of ripe pear and gentle citrus freshness. This is rounded and ripe, fresh and bouncy, with a clean-cut finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",87884
"76553","This blend of Mourvèdre (78%) and Grenache is a very pretty pale peach color. Aged in a mixture of concrete, stainless steel and neutral French oak, it suggests aromas of citrus, strawberry, herb and spice. It tingles the palate with fresh, lively flavors, showing poise and presence with a citrus-filled finish that lingers.","Rosé","Rosé","US",76553
"12830","A big Cabernet, impenetrably dark in color and tannicly closed. It has ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate flavors, with a jacket of sweet, toasted oak. It needs time for those tannins to resolve, so give it a good eight years in the bottle.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",12830
"8097","Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop.","Red","G-S-M","US",8097
"62343","Intensely herbaceous, this is a crisp, lemon and grapefruit-driven wine. Bright and fruity, it has a touch of minerality to keep it structured. Drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",62343
"71011","Appealing aromas of butterscotch, cream, spice, lees and tropical fruit lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that bring a sense of richness but also delicacy. It shows a touch of warmth on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",71011
"106369","Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, this boasts aromas of black currant, mature plum, black pepper and clove. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and Mediterranean brush accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",106369
"97025","This is a new project for Chris Figgins (Leonetti Cellar, FIGGINS, Doubleback), using grapes sourced from the Ribbon Ridge and Schindler vineyards. Dense with an exotic weave of aromatics, it has the irresistible appeal of the 2012 vintage. Mulberry, plum, cinnamon and a dash of truffle salt all combine in a plush, generous, well-integrated wine, with a rich, textural mouthfeel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",97025
"60332","Another terrific Napa ‘99, this one packed with opulent flavors of cassis, green olives and herbs, wrapped generously in fine toasty oak. The wine is very dry and the tannins are fine and complex. The delicious finish goes on and on.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",60332

"105204","This wine, from one of the coolest parts of the Russian River Valley, has hints of the mushroomy earthiness that plagues some 2011 Pinot Noirs. But for whatever reason (good viticulture and careful sorting are likely), that slight unripeness remains only in the background as a complex counter to the tart cranberries, cherries and cola. The wine is marked by dryness and bright acidity. Surely it wants some time in the bottle. Drink after 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105204
"22612","Jammy fruit and strawberry aromas characterize the nose of this chewy Chianti Classico. You'll appreciate the juicy softness and velvety qualities it imparts in the mouth.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",22612
"3841","This blend features aromas of vanilla, sweet tobacco and cherry followed by big, masculine flavors of cassis, raspberry, tobacco and cedar. Deep spice undertones add to the dimension of the wine. Ageable and intense and best paired with more robust meat dishes.","Red","Red Blend","South Africa",3841
"7944","There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec. A muscular, powerful wine, it's intense in hay and herb, the finish veering savory to the point of sour.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",7944
"23547","This blend of 70% Ciliegiolo and 30% Canaiolo opens with muddled aromas that includes chalk, black berries, antiseptic and barnyard. The simple palate delivers overripe blackberry and a hint of black pepper along with a meaty rusticity. It ends on a bitter, medicinal note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",23547
"27984","This was a perplexing wine to evaluate. The aromas feature toasted hazelnuts, lemon curd, pineapple and more than a hint of banana bread. The flavors follow in a similar vein, but are exaggerated, coming across as strongly tropical and confected, then drawing to a crisp finish.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",27984
"26193","A deeply impressive Bordeaux blend. It comes from this small, but prestigious, appellation, which is a bridge between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Marked by dryness and a superb tannic structure, it has deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, violets, herbs and cedar. Needs time. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",26193
"24985","Initially restrained, this opens into whirls of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit peel with an almost fizzy zestiness. Refreshment travels along the palate in total precision and linearity, with a rush of citrusy excitement.","White","Riesling","Austria",24985
"40126","Made entirely with Viognier, this has delicate aromas of white grapefruit and orchard fruit, while the straightforward palate delivers apricot and citrus. Enjoy soon.","White","Viognier","Italy",40126
"18598","Pale in color, with delicate Pinot-like aromas of strawberry, beetroot, coffee and hard spices. Drinks lightly fruity, spicy and dry. It's a simple, one-dimensional wine, but a very pretty one, and notable for its polished flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18598
"62817","Aromas of forest floor and herbal berry fruits set up a wide grabby palate that's neither heavy nor overdone. Inky oaky berry flavors are limited in scope and complexity, while this finishes strong, with latent spice notes.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",62817
"16247","A simple wine, soft and candied, with raspberry and cherry flavors. It's a Rhône-style blend based on Syrah.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",16247
"94975","This 100% varietal wine is appealing with aromas of coffee, toasty barrel spices, berry and red fruit. It displays good richness and depth, offering plenty of pleasure now but clearly keeping an eye on the future. Best after 2018.","Red","Merlot","US",94975
"4796","This smells flowery but also flabby and oily. The palate has a creamy, tropical feel to it and flavors of melon, papaya and powdered sugar. A soft, lightly bitter-tasting finish could use more pop, scour and balance.","White","Viognier","Argentina",4796
"43758","This classic cool-climate California Chardonnay shows intensely concentrated kumquat, lime and peach flavors, off set by bright acidity. There's quite a bit of oak on it, but it's balanced, and adds a pleasant layer of buttered toast flavor.","White","Chardonnay","US",43758
"80889","This delicious Amarone is loaded with ripe plum and black cherry flavors, layered with black pepper and clove. It's structured but elegant, with firm tannins and enough acidity to age well and develop complexity. Drink after 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",80889
"54796","This well-made wine brings briary, brambly notes to its core raspberry fruit. The impression of light herbaceousness continues through a medium-long finish, with a hint of thistle and wet stone. The wine spent 10 months in 50% new French oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54796
"93376","Tart and semi-ripe, this blackberry and cherry-flavored has a sweet-and-sour taste.","Red","Merlot","US",93376
"90069","Give this Bordeaux blend a good, long decant before you pour. It's tight and young in tannins and acids, and the blackberry, cherry and currant flavors have a jammy edge. It's a well-made wine despite the rugged mouthfeel. Based on Merlot, its future is entirely unpredictable.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",90069
"16411","Inviting floral notes open the aromatics of this wine. These evolve into a thick palate of melon and citrus, the finish light and high in acidity. Straightforward and balanced, it's a quaffer.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",16411
"72415","Nothing really atypical about this Petit Verdot. It's rich, softly ripe and flamboyant in the modern Napa style, with flashy black cherry, currant, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors. Drink this fancy young wine soon with a great steak or chop.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",72415
"16793","A light and fruity wine that is deliciously crisp with raspberry flavors and is nicely cut with acidity. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",16793
"68130","Intense smoke and mineral tones mingle with fragrant lemon peel and lavender in this slightly exotic off-dry Riesling. It's buoyantly peachy yet also cutting and spry, finishing bright on a streak of tangerine acidity.","White","Riesling","Germany",68130
"82703","Made in a sweetly ripe, oaky manner, this is a drink-me-now Pinot Noir. Easy to like for its jammy raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The acidity and soft tannins define the modern Russian River style.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",82703
"83934","Jammy boysenberry aromas are a touch oaky. Loud acidity gives zest and ring to cherry, plum and raspberry flavors. While this is a bit shear and hard on the palate, solid berry flavors along with cocoa and brown sugar make for a good ending.","Red","Shiraz","Chile",83934
"105606","One of several properties owned by the Laplace family, this estate has produced a ripe, juicy and generously tannic wine. It has luscious acidity as well as bold black-currant fruit. With some dark tannins and a firm structure, it can age. Drink starting from 2018.","Red","Red Blend","France",105606
"53517","Big, friendly and wrapped in a lot of chocolatey oak. The fruit is forward and light, and it is just big enough to hang in there with all the barrel flavors. —P.G.","Red","Merlot","US",53517
"43524","This wine leaves no doubt about the variety, with its freshly peeled orange and jasmine notes. The palate is sweet yet not cloying, with impeccable balance. For those looking for a well-priced sweet wine, look no further.","White","Riesling","US",43524
"10383","Pristine black cherries and berries extend from nose to finish in this deeply concentrated Pinot Noir. Invigorating acidity and firm grippy tannins accentuate its bold four-square palate. Finishes long, with a delicate murmur of spice and cedar. Drink now through 2025.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",10383
"94675","A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather. It's fresh and ripe in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg. Smooth on the finish, it gets things right without pushing the envelope.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",94675
"37215","This is a massively rich style of Chardonnay bordering on fat, but delicious throughout. The nose offers aromas of golden apple slices, jasmine, honeysuckle, marzipan, melon and prominent pineapple. Once sipped, vanilla-laced butter and sea-salt caramel flavors ensure.","White","Chardonnay","US",37215
"10773","This robust red shows plenty of ripe berry flavors, firm texture and full body. It has a gripping mouthfeel and persistent raspberry and cranberry flavors that make the mouth water.","Red","Tempranillo","US",10773
"55529","Beets, mint and cola mark the aromas of this robust offering from the southern part of the state. It’s rich and corpulent—almost Port-like in its dimensions—and although it lacks a bit of elegance, it certainly possesses plenty of mouth-filling flavor.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55529
"47436","Amarone Alteo is a dark, savory red wine with masculine aromas of spice, tobacco, leather, licorice and loads of jammy fruit and black currant. In fact, the brightness of the fruit is ultimately what distinguishes this lush, powerful (with 17.5% alcohol) blend.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",47436
"63299","This shows a riper, softer personality compared to previous vintages of this wine. The finish is plush and rich and should pair with succulent cuts of red meat.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",63299
"34349","Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",34349
"85365","Another good example of how Lake County grows excellent big reds. Delicious, rich, almost chocolaty, this nevertheless dry wine is packed with flavor. It's concentrated, very smooth despite massive tannins and just a pleasure to taste. Tempting now, but best after 2020.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",85365
"39542","Thin, with lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors that already are starting to taste old and dried out.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",39542
"19878","A great value wine, its firm tannins surrounded by the freshest berry fruits and acidity. For drinking young, with its attractive ripe, open flavors.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",19878
"73252","A good buy in a Cabernet that's dry and elegant enough to pair with a great steak, chop or roast. It has classic blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors, and is soft enough to drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",73252
"36703","Some oxygen exposure seems to peek through on the aromas along with notes of blue fruit and herbs. This wine is lightly flavored with a gritty feel to the tannins and the oak dialed back.","Red","Sangiovese","US",36703
"28008","This blend of Syrah, Castelão and Aragonez has the typical cool feel of a wine from coastal Lisboa. It offers firm tannins, stalky black currant fruits and bright acidity, all packaged in a smooth texture with a soft, juicy aftertaste.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",28008
"34547","Grenache (38%) takes the lead followed by Mourvèdre (34%) and Syrah, with the fruit coming from Seven Hills and Les Collines vineyards. Blueberry pie, herb and spice aromas are followed by extracted blue and black-fruit flavors that bring some warmth along with them.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",34547
"48245","This excellent, restrained bottling is compelling. Lemongrass, kaffir lime and lemon-lime aromas lead into a palate laced with fresh, high-toned citrus notes. More exotic touches of sweet onion, yuzu and wet slate complete the experience.","White","Chardonnay","US",48245
"72733","From a particular block of an estate vineyard, this is a high-strung, high-acid Pinot that's earthy and piquant on the tongue. The aromas offer a mix of spearmint and dried herb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72733
"99398","This is a luscious boldly extracted Cabernet Sauvignon full of fleshy ripe blackberry and plum flavors. It's also a nuanced wine, shaded by wisps of smoke and bramble, and calibrated with zesty mouthwatering acidity. The finish is marked by lingering spice and ripe rigid tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99398
"6157","An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",6157
"44903","Although the wine is not particularly Cabernet-esque with its pepper, leather and cherry tobacco flavors that could almost be Petite Sirah or Sangiovese, it's a pretty good drink. Dry and robust, it will go well with grilled meats or Italian food.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",44903
"32242","Tart and tangy, these recently grafted Riesling vines deliver just-ripe flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, grapefruit and pineapple. It's close to a fruit bomb, but the significant acid underpinning keeps it juicy and gives it extra lift.","White","Riesling","US",32242
"10749","Intensely plush aromas of peach, daffodil, sweet rose and even pineapple show on the nose of this botting. There's lots of sizzle to the racy sip, where tart green apple, green pear and green-tomato flavors make for a tangy, refreshing wine.","White","Albariño","US",10749
"75078","Though pale in color, this is a tannic and flavorful wine with an earthy underpinning. Lightly spiced red-fruit flavors unfold and gather strength midpalate. This nicely captures the elegance of Naramata Bench Pinot Noir.","Red","Pinot Noir","Canada",75078
"31623","This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It leans slightly into the green, with aromas of fresh herbs mixed with vanilla, chocolate and other barrel spices. The palate is elegant, with a soft feel to the chocolate, cherry and barrel flavors.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",31623
"78825","A little on the candied side, with pineapple and lemon-tart flavors accented with buttered toast notes from oak. The acidity is excellent.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",78825
"81766","Distinctly Californian in the hugeness of the ripe fruit, just massive in blackberries and black cherries, liberally oaked and soft. Not particularly subtle at this time, but could do interesting things in the cellar. No guarantees.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",81766
"11176","New oak takes the limelight in this blend of 90% Montepulciano and 10% Sangiovese. The palate is dominated by wood, espresso, toast and vanilla alongside rubber, leafy sensations. It lacks fruit richness and has a drying, astringent finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",11176
"15806","Rich and forward in jammy black cherry, raspberry and spice flavors, this Zinfandel drinks well now. It's a tannic wine, as you'd expect off Howell Mountain, but those tannins are refined and sweet. Drink now with a nice steak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",15806
"72633","Coming from one of the state's top Chardonnay sites, this wine offers pleasing aromas of crushed stone along with peach, cardamom and other spices. It's sleek in style, with a tart lick of acidity. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.","White","Chardonnay","US",72633
"79838","Woodland berry, forest floor, blue flower, tobacco and a hint of leather come together in the glass. The chewy, accessible palate offers juicy wild cherry, fleshy raspberry, cake spice and star anise accompanied by velvety tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",79838
"16497","Clean, reserved citrus and ocean-influenced aromas set up a zesty palate with a common mix of tangerine, lime and green-herb flavors. A lasting finish with peppery snap helps this along.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",16497
"28429","Michael David continues to showcase some of the more unusual grape varieties. This Tannat is big shouldered, rich and decadent, and it tastes brambly, which Zinfandel fans will appreciate. It's full of jammy red fruit and leather notes, with a long finish.","Red","Tannat","US",28429
"93548","This wine combines notes of melon and candied apple with hints of pepper and ginger. Despite its modest alcohol level, it seems weighty, and even a bit sweet, then finishes on a mouthwatering, spicy note.","Rosé","Rosé","Australia",93548
"100025","Cheesy tomato-based aromas are rubbery and fiery. This feels lean and monotone. Stewed, salty flavors of earthy berry fruits are off base and dirty, while this is cheesy tasting on the finish.","Red","Merlot","Spain",100025
"46788","This is a sanguine, meaty and smoothly textured wine, relatively medium bodied and moderate in oak. Twists of dried cranberry and blueberry provide the fruity components, which are nuanced compared with the big hits of black and white pepper.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",46788
"96100","An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.","White","Chardonnay","US",96100
"7750","Always aged for a year before it is released, this iconic wine is impressive. It is superrich without losing freshness. Light wood toast, red fruits and balanced acidity meld together in a ripe, spicy whole. The wine could even age for another few months, so drink it this summer or keep until the end of 2016.","Rosé","Rosé","France",7750
"6423","A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",6423
"50707","Nicely dry and very crisp, with mouthwatering acidity that scours the palate and makes it brisk and clean. It's a little too fruity, though, with jammy pineapple, lemon and lime flavors that pall after a few sips.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",50707
"4525","Ecco Domani delivers consistent, easy-drinking wines that work well on informal occasions, but don't necessarily offer personality or territorial typicity. But we don't always want intellectual wines. If you are hankering for bright citrus and peach with mouth-cleansing acidity, this is a great choice.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",4525
"8238","Among St. Clair's 2009 range of block Savvies, this is among the sweatiest, with pungent nettle and almost-asparagus notes on the nose. Yet on the palate, the wine is full-bodied, round and concentrated, with nectarine and honey elements punched up by bright herbal tones. Long and intense on the finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",8238
"40092","This field blend is produced from old vines. It is rich and smooth with touches with spicy wood. The wood is showing strongly, perhaps not leaving enough room for fruit, however, that could improve as the wine ages more. Wait until 2017.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",40092
"17251","This Cab may be in a bit of a dip. It's awkward, with a sharp, edgy mouthfeel, and as the wine ages, raisin notes creep forward. Still, kudos to Ehret for holding the wine back for so long, as it does possess a certain complexity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",17251
"59689","This cooperative, situated in Aÿ in the heart of the Montagne de Reims, has produced a rich, structured wine from this fine vintage. It has tension, with a taut mineral character along with excellent white fruit flavor. Even at 11 years, the wine is young and will benefit from some bottle age. Drink from 2017.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",59689
"7710","A subtle nose of smoke and spice leads into flavors of smoke, slightly tart berry and spice on this affordable South African Merlot. Smooth tannins and a soft finish give the wine an everyday, food-friendly feel.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",7710
"71012","It's hard not to like this dark-colored and superripe wine made from 60% Alicante Bouschet plus Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. The broad texture soaks the palate with blackberry jam and chocolate flavors. Soft acidity and mild tannins create a surprisingly gentle mouthfeel considering the power of the wine.","Red","Red Blend","US",71012
"81086","Named in remembrance of the lost love of Portuguese king João V, this concentrated and rich wine is impressive. Its firm tannins are surrounded by the richest black fruits. They, in turn, are balanced with acidity and with a dry core that will allow the wine to age further. Drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",81086
"37961","Mourvèdre (81%) makes up the majority of this blend with Grenache (12%) and Syrah filling it out. It leans into savory notes, with aromas of sage, dried herbs, white pepper and mineral. The flavors are plush and palate-coating, bringing a slightly tacky feel that softens over time. It will be best after 2019.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",37961
"32559","This is a good, sound Cabernet. The blackberry and cherry fruit is candy-jammy, with an oaky overlay.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",32559
"51537","Extracted and jammy in black cherries and black raspberries, with hints of cocoa, this wine is fully dry and balanced. It tasty through the smooth finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",51537
"47860","This wine's raspberry jam, cocoa, fig and barrel spice aromas really pop. Its red fruit flavors are rich and ripe, providing hedonistic appeal.","Red","Merlot","US",47860
"56854","Tart cran-apple fruit—some of it from 35-year-old vines—is at the heart of this vineyard-designated cuvée. It has a woody/earthy undertone, tart acids and some stiffening tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56854
"79540","Light mineral and lemon-rind aromas are followed by dry, tart flavors. It should shine on the dinner table.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",79540
"24233","Combine prune, leather and spice notes with firm tannins and the result is a slightly rustic, old-school expression of Vacqueyras. It's concentrated and characterful, with up to a decade of aging potential.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",24233
"28616","Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling. It's quite soft on the palate, with black plum and hoisin sauce flavors accenting its core of dried purple fruit, black pepper and bacon fat. The finish offers a touch of maple syrup.","Red","Syrah","US",28616
"96542","With only 6,000 bottles produced, this limited-production selection might be tricky to find, but it's well worth the effort. Layered and nuanced, ripe fruit provides a perfect backdrop for accents of game, spice and oak. The silky texture is complemented by black cherry and plum-skin flavors, and the finish ends on a black tea note that lingers. Drink now–2017.","Red","Syrah","Israel",96542
"46934","BlackJack is sourced from the oldest block in the vineyard, planted in 1965. In this warm, ripe vintage it shows lovely blackberry and black cherry fruit, fully ripened and wreathed in streaks of smoke, ground coffee and dark chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46934
"79133","A caramel aroma sets the scene for a ripe, smooth wine. It has ripe red fruits that have a nutty, toasty character that balances with the crisp acidity and tight texture. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",79133
"80764","It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this deep, lush, purple Mencía from Bierzo. A concentrated, minerally, toasty black-fruit nose sets up blackberry, boysenberry, prune, juniper and beef jerky flavors. On the finish, it's sultry, dark and peppery. There's all sorts of power and sizzle to this; drink through 2019.","Red","Mencía","Spain",80764
"20050","Strong scents of mint and spice frame a burst of black-cherry fruit. It's followed with highlights of vanilla, coffee, cedar and mocha—suggesting that some innovative barrels were combined here. Overall, it's a potent and quite flavorful wine, ready to enjoy now through 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20050
"20794","The wine is soft, smooth and full of rich berry fruits. The blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet gives a warm southern feel: ripe wine, sunshine and soft tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the bold fruits and created a full generous aftertaste. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",20794
"65560","Subtle notes of peanut shell, brioche, wet wool and apple juice form the nose, leading to a palate that veers toward the light side, tasting a bit washed out.","White","Pinot Gris","US",65560
"91444","Deep ruby to the eye, this wine offers rich aromas of cherry, black licorice and orange rind and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, cassis, anisette and eucalyptus. Long-lasting tannins coat the mouth but there is always a sense of fresh fruit on the palate and a brightness that lingers right into the satisfying finish.","Red","Merlot","Israel",91444
"42189","The packaging stands out with its tiny grape cutting that's tied to the bottle's neck. This is a bright wine that's redolent of lemon soda, chalky candy (like Pez) and apricot.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",42189
"19890","With bright lemon freshness, this wine positively zings through its ripe melon and pineapple flavors. The balance here between the acidity and richness gives a delicious tension.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",19890
"14156","This wine is always impressive, but its degree of greatness is vintage driven, suggesting its extreme sensitivity to the Oakville terroir. The 2009 is ageable and concentrated, better than the 2008 but falling short of the 2007, which approached perfection. Dry and tannic, it's rich in blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate flavors. The long, spicy finish only hints at the intensity. Hold until 2015, and it should have a long life for many years beyond.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",14156
"36169","Another great Anderson Valley Pinot from Drew, made using fruit from a vineyard in Philo—the “deep end” or coolest section of the valley. While you won't find obnoxious acidity despite the officially high reading, the wine does have cool-climate notes of mushrooms, pine needles and cola, in addition to classic fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries. It's very fine, dry and complex; enjoy now or cellar for 6–8 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36169
"51902","A soft, rich wine, spiced with light wood. Fine blackberry fruit, soft tannins and attractive acidity are all well in balance. The wine has a fresh, juicy finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",51902
"90072","Smoothly toasty wine, the wood element broadening the light apple fruit without overwhelming it. This attractive, basic Chablis has a fine, taut layer of acidity, grapefruit and apple juice crispness.","White","Chardonnay","France",90072
"96258","A lusty wine, soft and exceedingly fruity, as befits its warm origins. Flashy in raspberry and cherry jam, roasted coconut, sweet mocha and cinnamon flavors, with a savory touch of bacon.","Red","Syrah","US",96258
"24395","Floral aromas mixed with citrus notes are appealing. This wine feels round but solidified by bright core acidity. Ripe flavors include pineapple, mango and peach. On the finish, lime and tropical notes are good but short.","White","Verdejo","Spain",24395
"93117","Grapefruit, grass and lime characters are woven together in this simple but solid example of Kiwi Sauvignon Blanc. There's a slight weight on the palate, with a chalky texture, refreshing acidity and a long, lemony finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",93117
"81716","Here's a beautiful Riserva Pinot Bianco that delivers intense aromas of stone fruit, honey, melon and toasted almond. The wine rests on the lees for eight months for extra heft and density on its naturally rich texture. Pair it with shellfish or white meat.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",81716
"50313","Mealy white-fruit aromas are lacking in clarity and freshness, while the flavor profile is based on pineapple. The finish is broad and heavy.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",50313
"71638","Pressed apple and pear notes are brightened by a kiss of yellow cherries and lemon in this delicate wine. The palate has a pleasant roundness despite its light-bodied frame. The finish is brisk.","White","Chardonnay","US",71638
"88983","This is done in a style that walks the line between Kabinett and Spatlese; it's just 11% alcohol but the fruit sweetness is largely hidden behind the tangy natural acids. It's got the mixed fruit flavors of peach, apricot, citrus and even a hint of tropical, along with the edgy definition of citrus peel that gives it a crisp finish.","White","Riesling","US",88983
"96841","There are loads of fresh floral and red spice notes on the nose of this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah: hibiscus, cinnamon, dried cherry and baking spice. The palate leads with a touch of maple syrup, filling out with red berry, savory smoke and thyme flavors, underpinned by upright tannins and refreshing acidity.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",96841
"69827","Another of the producer's inaugural releases, this hails from the heart of Carneros where vineyards once belonging to Buena Vista had stood. Characteristic of the appellation, the wine is earthy and herbal, with light, crisp waves of grenadine and strawberry, staying light and textured on the palate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",69827
"95850","Stalky, funky aromas suggest spent fruit and sauerkraut. Plump on the palate, but bitter, briny and stalky tasting, this conveys salty, peppery white-fruit flavors and a poor mouthfeel.","White","Verdejo","Spain",95850
"103440","Supple and bursting with ripe purple fruits, this is a real success. The grape's stemmy and green character is held in restraint, and the purple plummy fruit flavors come through in a sweet core, surrounded with flavors of espresso, dark chocolate and stem. Well balanced and firm, this is a wine to enjoy now through 2022.","Red","Carmenère","US",103440
"55027","This wine's aromas are quite generous, suggesting herbs, vanilla, baking spice and purple fruit. Its cranberry and cherry flavors are both tart and ripe, supported by soft tannins and a lingering café au lait note. The oak influence gets in the way of the fruit at times, but it's pleasant all the same.","Red","Merlot","US",55027
"9712","This succulent wine opens with an intensely spicy nose of white and black pepper accented with ripe berry. The sleek, savory palate delivers juicy black cherry and cooking spice framed in solid but refined tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young and paired with everyday fare.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",9712
"12562","Considerably lighter than the previous vintage of Pinot Gris, this mixes cucumber, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors, with bracing acidity behind the fruit. It's a rather delicate wine, with a balanced palate of fruit flesh, skin and mineral.","White","Pinot Gris","US",12562
"61173","The winery's first varietal bottling of Petit Verdot comes from Phinny Hill Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills. It's lightly aromatic with notes of peat, freshly tilled soil, and cherry. It shows all of the variety's brawn with dry, grainy tannins.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",61173
"90755","A blend of grapes including traditional Corvina and Rondinella undergoes air-drying for extra-rich concentration and intensity. That, with careful oak aging, has shaped a richly textured, dense wine that would pair with game meat or bean soup with smoked bacon. It shows raw, slightly chewy tannins on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",90755
"47842","Dark and sweet smelling, with marzipan, coconut, licorice and black fruit aromas. Surprisingly clacky and tartaric feeling, with oak-slathered berry flavors that are both baked and racy. Shows flashes of quality flavors, but the mouthfeel and overall balance are just o.k.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",47842
"90110","This is a blockbuster of a wine, powerfully built grape by grape, with just a handful of Merlot. Cherry vanilla, leathery cedar and juicy plum combine around a lush, voluptuous mouthfeel of tension and tannin. Incredibly satisfying, it shows a length of spicy clove on the finish that appears to go on for days. This is a beauty too hard to sock away, though it should do well in the cellar another decade or two.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90110
"48192","It is the ripe dark Alicante Bouschet that dominates this firmly structured wine. It is packed with tannins along with a hugely dense texture and concentrated juicy berry flavors. It is very firm, still young. Wait until 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",48192
"70121","Citrus freshness suggests lovely lightness on the nose, the palate, however, weighs in with more zestiness and brings in more rounded flesh that plumps this out beautifully. The center of gravity is definitely on the spicy-midpalate but arrives on aromatic, almost floral wings.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",70121
"69668","Tight, taut and mineral, tense and concentrated. There is intense acidity and a touch of spice, but this is all about structure and suppressed fruit. Keep this wine at least until 2010.","White","Riesling","Austria",69668
"70993","Robust blackberry and herbal notes on the nose lead to a powerful, blocky palate with bold acidity. Well-oaked cassis and spice flavors are earthy, while flavors of mint, cinnamon and herbs grace the finish. Drink through 2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",70993
"2367","Made with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of black currant and a whiff of brown spice. The palate doles out blackberry jam, clove and a toasted note alongside gripping tannins that leave a firm finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",2367
"103127","Including nearly a quarter Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec, this estate grown Cabernet Franc is a bit aromatically muted but brings juicy cherry and butterscotch flavors and soft, plush tannins.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",103127
"47865","With its crisp texture, this wine is bright and fruity, with good acidity and a complex background of spice, vanilla and yellow fruits. The wine is deliciously balanced and ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",47865
"37820","Toasted oak and vanilla are noticeably present on the palate and nose of this wine, which evolves in the glass to take on a more tropical feel and tastes of ripe pineapple and guava. Medium to light in texture, it finishes smoothly and flat.","White","Chardonnay","US",37820
"9727","Smells bland, with a bit of apple. The palate is candied and soft, with sweet orange, mango and other tropical flavors. Finishes honeyed and lazy, with sweet, simple flavors of honeydew and apple juice.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",9727
"29256","A smooth, creamed apple-wine, ripe and delicious. It has a sweet feel to it, the acidity just giving a bite. A great apéritif.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",29256
"81773","An excellent wine for drinking now. It's dry and fruity, with a meaty, fleshy texture housing flavors of blackberries, cherries, herbs and oak. Fine enough to drink with a good steak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",81773
"55476","Bright, lively notes of yellow peach, apricot and melon adorn the bouquet of this attractive white, while hints of spiced orange, ginger and fresh herbs mingle in the background. It's medium weight and well balanced, with ample acidity and final touches of rosewater and sweet spice that grace the finish. Drink now.","White","Viognier","South Africa",55476
"72632","This wine is near-equal parts Marsanne and Picpoul. It brings zesty aromas of spice, lees, almond and citrus followed by a medium-bodied palate with a zing of acidity and good balance.","White","White Blend","US",72632
"2604","This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.","Red","Merlot","US",2604
"25218","A big step down from the past two vintages. This Verdejo lacks fortitude and clarity; it's grassy and flat on the nose, then cloying on the palate. Flavors of bland citrus are disjointed and underwhelming. Finishes grassy and green.","White","Verdejo","Spain",25218
"82966","Merlot is certainly one of the real strengths at Fidélitas, and two different versions are offered. This broad and flavorful effort has pretty cherry fruit backed with pleasing baking spices. The finish is focused and precise, adding streaks of cinnamon and chocolate.","Red","Merlot","US",82966
"12116","Baked blackberry and licorice show on the nose of this Super Tuscan-style blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. It combines Old World and New World elements well, its rocky minerality framing baked blackberry fruit, underpinned by chalky tannins and steady acidity.","Red","Red Blend","US",12116
"37873","Fans of powerful, fruit-driven Zinfandel will exult in this monster of a wine. It is an explosion of blueberry, raspberry, plum, blackberry, chocolate-covered raisin and sandalwood flavors. This is tannic, and the high alcohol gives it a glycerine-driven sweetness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",37873
"11851","A wonderfully fruity, dry wine, it is exuberantly Chenin Blanc, with its ripe honey and pear flavors. It tastes of almonds, rounded with a rich texture and finished with acidity. The wine is both impressive and delicious.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",11851
"37366","Black plum and elderberry jam aromas mix with leather, tobacco, crushed sage and oregano on this blend of 50% Grenache, 38% Syrah and 12% Petite Sirah from the Warner Springs area. The palate packs lots of crushed herbs, graphite and cedar with dried berries, laced together with firm, sticky tannins.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",37366
"61582","Nice manners and medium body make this an easy-drinking, lighter wine. The aromas are like cherries and strawberries, the fruit flavors are almost sweet, and the texture is soft and smooth.","Red","Zinfandel","US",61582
"61442","Crisp lemon, apple and pear abound in this richly textured yet pertly balanced Pinot Blanc. It's an easy quaffing, elegant wine with hints of nut and toast that extend elegantly on the finish. Drink now through 2020.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",61442
"88826","A heavy oak character controls the nose, and with it comes aromas of sawdust, vanilla, cocoa and raspberry. This feels a bit sticky and creamy, while palpable oak returns on the palate and creates vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors. Heat, high acidity and peppery spice work the finish on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",88826
"97978","This medium-bodied full-flavored wine is a great example of the dry-style wines from Anderson Valley. It starts with a rose-like perfume, then floods the palate with Anjou pear and white peach. It feels rich and creamy, but also has good acidity and a tasty lingering finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",97978
"100552","A superbly rich wine, with its acidity well integrated into the concentrated and rounded fruit. It has great texture and fruit that bursts from the glass. It is generous, warm and toasty, while also preserving the steeliness that is hallmark of the Les Clos vineyard. Age for at least five years.","White","Chardonnay","France",100552
"66444","A big, rich, exuberant Malbec, one of the better ones out there. It's firm in tannins, yet soft and luscious, with deep, dark plum, cassis, beef jerky and spice flavors. Grows even finer and elegant as it warms in the glass.","Red","Malbec","US",66444
"30972","This wine from Moris Farms is ripe with thick layers of blackberry, forest fruit, green leaf, dried hay and earthy Porcini mushroom. It has a chewy, almost sweet consistency with bold texture and good length.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",30972
"43568","Rich, ripe scents of cherry pie and cherry cola waft from this profoundly aromatic Merlot. It's boldly alcoholic and full bodied, but the palate shows restraint with crisp red berry flavors highlighted by a streak of acidity. Soft, furry tannins coat the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",43568
"81769","Theres just a bit of oak on this wine, which gives a pleasant buttered toast and vanilla edge to the ripe lime, kiwi, green apple and Asian pear fruit. With crisp acidity, it's a clean wine that's a little sweet, but not too much.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",81769
"75281","This is an aromatic wine, with generous notes of potpourri, clove, dried herb and purple fruit. The palate is lush and fruit forward, supported by tart, vibrant acidity. It's lovely on its own but should really sing at the dinner table.","Red","Malbec","US",75281
"41689","Situated in the valley on the other side of the hill from Bandol and the sea, this estate has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. The high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend contributes a perfumed character and some structure. It is a complete, ripe and concentrated wine that will age, and will be better from late 2016.","Rosé","Rosé","France",41689
"41999","This shows hallmark Nebbiolo aromas of violet, rose, earth and forest floor. The silky palate delivers ripe black cherry and balsamic notes, smooth tannins and just enough fresh acidity. This is ready now.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",41999
"39273","Yes, this is a rosé of Merlot from high altitude vineyards in the south of France. It's medium in weight, offering hints of red berries, wild herbs and wet stones and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now.","Red","Merlot","France",39273
"60132","A Négrette-based wine, this is full of red berry flavors and that leathery, polished character that is typical of the grape. It has plenty of acidity as well as a tight, tannic character. The wine will always be tannic, so it is ready to drink now.","Red","Red Blend","France",60132
"59733","This ripe, lively wine is bursting with red fruits. Crisp and clean, it features a light mineral character that gives it tight texture balanced by refreshing raspberry and orange flavors. The aftertaste shines with crisp acidity.","Rosé","Rosé","France",59733
"89583","The alcohol has dropped to just above 12% in this vintage, and the wine seems a tad underripe. Overtly grassy and pungent, it suggests with petrol, gooseberry and green banana. Drink it well-chilled.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",89583
"460","Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't seem to entirely come together.","Red","Syrah","US",460
"56482","Aromas of black-skinned berry marinated in spirits, dark spice, chopped herb and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The robust assertive palate offers dried sour cherry, powdered sage and star anise alongside a backbone of bracing, mouth-drying tannins that grip the finish. Give this a few more years to soften, then drink up to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",56482
"100383","This straightforward Sangiovese-based wine conveys subdued aromas of blackberry, espresso and toasted notes. The palate is somewhat dilute but offers restrained red cherry and hints of white pepper alongside firm but fleeting tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",100383
"87215","This is a structured wine from 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon that has plenty of fruit. With some firm tannins as well as concentrated blackberry fruit, it is going to be a fine wine. It was created under the direction of consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt's team. Start drinking from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",87215
"21865","Light hay in color and with a creamy, near-perfect foam, this sparkler shows fresh Asian pear, light plumeria, wet river stone and rain-on-sidewalk aromas, altogether quite minerally on the nose. Impressively textural, it's cleansing on the palate, a bit like licking chalk, with flavors of lemon skin, tart yellow-apple rind and crisp pear flesh.","White","Chardonnay","US",21865
"40903","One of the consistently finest Rieslings from the state, this is technically off dry, but feels dry given its exceptional acidity. Elegant citrus and floral aromas introduce a dense, textural midpalate. A showcase of style and panache, its layered citrus and stone fruits bring both skin and flesh flavors into focus.","White","Riesling","US",40903
"104859","Nelson is well known for its aromatic whites, so it's no surprise that this Maori-owned brand has bottled an attractive Grüner Veltliner from the region. Delicate leafy aromas accent stone fruit, while the medium-bodied wine is zesty, long and elegant, with no hint of bitterness. Drink now.","White","Grüner Veltliner","New Zealand",104859
"27649","This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27649
"92913","The partner to Copains d'Abord, this wine sports a label of women having a good time at a party. The wine suits the image: fresh, fruity and juicy.","Red","Gamay","France",92913
"103855","Well balanced, bringing together its firm, youthful tannins with ripe jammy fruits and  great swathes of spice and chocolate. It needs aging, but it is an impressive wine.","Red","Malbec","France",103855
"63198","Very light in the glass and fresh on the nose, this bottling by Chumash tribe descendant Tara Gomez offers aromas of lemon blossom and honeydew rind. There is good tension to the sip, which is very much focused on texture, with flashes of green apple skins and lime peels, proving quite tight and zesty.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",63198
"31512","Light, clear and focused, this features crisp, citrusy acidity and tethered layers of rhubarb and cranberry, with subtle hints of forest floor in the background. Light bodied and elegant, it finishes with just a tiny bite of tannin.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",31512
"81763","Pleasant red-fruit aromas kick it off, followed by regular-weight cherry and cassis flavors that come with a hint of herbal essence. The finish is racy and almost rough, but there's enough body and weight to the wine to push it across the finish line.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",81763
"102369","This is a simple, fruity Beaujolais. It has cherry flavors that are spoilt by the hints of banana. Acidity and light tannins complete a wine that is drinkable immediately.","Red","Gamay","France",102369
"101531","This is Murray's junior version of Syrah, less expensive than his Watch Hill bottling, but also not as charming. It's dry, tannic and a little sharp, with red currant, brown sugar and pepper flavors.","Red","Syrah","US",101531
"51906","This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",51906
"89907","A straightforward nose with honest raspberry fruit and an underlying green plum note. There's well-defined acidity and rounded tannins though a turnip note makes for a less than stellar ending. Drink now to 1 year.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",89907
"91711","Modus delivers velvety aromas of black cherry, chocolate, leather, exotic spice and pipe tobacco. This super Tuscan blend is comprised of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and it does a very nice job of showing the soft side of those grape varieties, especially on the long finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",91711
"45433","Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45433
"1680","A dense and rich, jammy Merlot that is full of black fruit and has an ultra-ripe feel. It is hardly Bordeaux, but it does hold attraction with its rich, full fruits and dense tannins. A smoke and bitter chocolate aftertaste suggests some firm extraction.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",1680
"24759","Starts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",24759
"79047","Made with 40% Nero d'Avola, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, this suggests aromas of toast, espresso, pressed violet and baked plum. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, black currant and a hint of cake spice alongside fine-grained but not very persistent tannins. Drink now to capture the remaining fruit.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",79047
"90842","Aromas of sweet honey and caramelized sugar on this Bulgarian Riesling belie a palate that's crisp, dry and bristling with acidity. Fresh lemon and apple flavors lack concentration but finish briskly with a hint of dusty minerality.","White","Riesling","Bulgaria",90842
"85190","Simple and watery, it has oaky flavors of citrus fruits and peaches. There's not much going on, but it is dry and crisp in acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",85190
"60763","This wine comes from the highest terrace above the Lot River, giving it a cool, fresh feel. Gravel and chalk soil give both lightness and minerality. Black fruits, integrated tannins and juicy final acidity mean this is a wine that will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.","Red","Malbec","France",60763
"84252","Showing strong, dense structure, this is a full, tannic wine. It starts tough and dry on the palate. The fruit comes through slowly, revealing red berry flavors. It needs to age, so don't drink before 2015.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",84252
"68024","Lots of ripe, luscious raspberry, cherry and mocha fruit in this Cabernet. It has good acidity and some fine tannins. One drawback is the finish, which is rich in brown sugar and glycerine, with high alcohol. Drink up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",68024
"1028","This easygoing white starts with a fresh nose of grapefruit, fig and flowers and leads into zesty but complex flavors of tropical fruit and citrus. Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",1028
"105804","This softly appealing Syrah has pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries, with cinnamon spice, brown sugar and baked crust overtones. It's a dry, interesting wine that belies its everyday price.","Red","Syrah","US",105804
"67504","Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",67504
"78917","Candied berry aromas include a mild spice note. This 50-50 blend of Cabernet and Malbec feels juicy but short on depth. Spicy, briny red-fruit flavors dry out on a finish with red bell pepper and black-pepper notes.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",78917
"23510","Briny citrus, saline and lees aromas drive the nose on this minerally Albariño that also offers mild oak notes. Flavors of green banana, peach, apple and woodspice finish crisp and with a touch of elegance.","White","Albariño","Spain",23510
"27927","This is a blend of several marquee vineyards, including Gap's Crown, Martinelli and Widdoes. It comes together nicely in a mix of fig and baked bread, peppered in baking spices and dried herb. Cherry comes through along with subtle hints of violet and rose, before a long, lingering finish ties things in a juicy bow at the end.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27927
"48223","Six months in oak barrels have given the nose of this wine a lovely overlay of mocha and coffee on top of the cherry fruit. Raspberry flavors dominate the mouth while vanilla and strawberry linger on the finish. Lush acidity and only the barest remnant of tannin make this a good choice forwhite fish in a fruit-based sauce.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48223
"44220","This is a ripe and structured wine with great fruit and still some firm tannins. It has layers of black-currant acidity along with the dry core that signal the potential to age further. The blend of 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine firmness while allowing plenty of expression for the exuberant fruit. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",44220
"102600","Earthy blackberry aromas come with an herbal/leafy edge. The palate is clacky and tannic, but low on volume and stuffing. Tastes of hollow but dark berry fruits, with a hint of buttery oak. A good but average type of Tempranillo.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",102600
"56074","Purple and black fruits spread across the midpalate, with herbal, tannic flavors from the Franc and floral highlights from the PV. There is a bit of a hole in the middle, and the tannins seem to hit a bit hard following that drop-off. It could be a phase, or it could be a failing.","Red","Red Blend","US",56074
"61557","Toasty, pomaceous scents lead onto the lithe, medium-bodied palate. The acidity gains steam on the finish, making the wine feel zesty and tense.","White","Chardonnay","US",61557
"30486","Smooth, creamy and round, this offers mango, peach and fresher grapefruit flavors, well integrated into its full-bodied texture. With its delicious rich feel, it has weight as well as final acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",30486
"59968","This is the personal project of Archery Summit winemaker Chris Mazepink. It's named for the bees that buzz around the vines. Rich gold in hue, it marries the flavors of ripe apples to bee pollen and lemon curd. The flavors fold into a well-developed finish, bringing up highlights of citrus peel.","White","Chardonnay","US",59968
"91310","Tannins give a dark, mineral structure. The black fruits, slowly coming through, are still part of this serious purpose, with wood flavors and dry fruits prominent. It still needs aging, so don't drink before 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",91310
"5335","Berry and lemon-peel aromas come with a note of plastic. This feels narrow and acidic, and thus scraping. Tart plum and spice flavors lead to an herbal high-acid palate that leaves a sour lasting impression.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",5335
"75480","Slightly sweet and confected with raspberry fruit roll-up and berry preserve aromas. A glimmer of crushed carnation flavors switch things up in the lightweight but round and soft mouth.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",75480
"49501","Forward berry and plum aromas are pleasant on the nose. On the palate, high acid drives flavors of plum and red berry fruit to a short and clean finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",49501
"57514","This is 100% varietal from the historic Foppiano clone, the wine marked by grapy leather and buoyant acidity in equal parts. Chocolate and gunpowder show up along the way, before a big grip gets aggressive on the finish, blown off by a few more swirls of the glass.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",57514
"52490","The aromas of dried herbs, fresh tobacco, rose petals, mineral, cranberry and cherry fascinate. The palate brings pillowy soft red-fruit flavors that show a sense of vibrancy and delicacy. It drinks more like Grenache than Sangiovese but after a sip or two, who cares?","Red","Sangiovese","US",52490
"25592","A zesty wine with more zap and tang than one might expect. That said, it's solid as a rock, with intense flavors of cherry, plum, carob and oak. Call it a bit obtuse, if you will. But even with woody finishing notes of vanilla and cream, this settles on fruit more so than the barrel. Carmenère (78%) with Syrah and Carignan.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",25592
"93011","This is an aromatic, sweet smelling Riesling with notes of ripe peach and honeysuckle. Though labeled as dry, at 1.86% residual sugar it drinks almost medium-sweet. Misdirection aside, it provides good value.","White","Riesling","US",93011
"48363","This mild-flavored wine delivers light apple, floral, almond and maraschino-cherry flavors, a smooth, soft texture and medium body. Although subtle, it does develop more complexity in the glass.","White","Pinot Gris","US",48363
"55639","A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this opens with aromas of sun-baked earth, ripe plum, blue flower and a whiff of oak-driven spice. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, anise, coconut, mocha and grilled sage alongside dusty tannins that leave a slightly astringent finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",55639
"42547","Assembled from the same lots as the winery's more expensive varietal wines, this high-powered, Bordeaux-style blend is one of Walla Walla's best values. Big and bursting with dark-fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and cassis, the barrel aging adds espresso and chocolate in generous amounts. There's noticeable heat on the finish, but no lack of potent flavor.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",42547
"42278","Produced from organically-grown grapes, this ripe wine has the proper crisp texture, bright acidity and salted lemon flavors. It is totally ready to drink.","White","Melon","France",42278
"89112","Aromas of melon and barley lead to flavors of white peach, almond blossom and jasmine in this Rhône-style blend. A touch creamy with full mouthfeel, this wine is a delight through the bright finish, which offers a glimpse of pink grapefruit.","White","White Blend","Israel",89112
"75967","Aromas of toasted oak, pressed yellow flower and ripe orchard fruit carry over to the palate along with toasted nut, yellow apple and a hint of vanilla. Enjoy soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",75967
"11360","A smooth and ripe wine with tropical fruits as well as more crisp apple. It is ripe wine, full in the mouth with a final perfumed acidity. Give it another six months.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",11360
"9199","Power and concentration exude from this wine. Very structured, very firm, it has solid tannins backed up by powerful black, juicy fruits. Blackberry flavors are still developing in this seriously ageworthy wine. Drink from 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",9199
"97108","Plenty of acid underscores rich flavors of pineapple, Meyer lemon and lemon curd. The wine dives deeply into the palate and lingers, with crisp highlights of citrus rind and a long, smooth finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",97108
"95674","Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, toasted hazelnut, dark spice, menthol and new leather emerge in the glass. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, coffee and chewing tobacco while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",95674
"14636","Loamy, ripe berry aromas come with leather and raisiny notes. This blend of five grapes is heavy, tannic and weighty, but not overtly out of balance. Stewed berry and raisiny flavors are as ripe as they can get and still stay somewhat fresh, while the finish is raisiny. Overall this is a one-dimensional, fully ripe wine.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",14636
"76780","A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, this is soft and sublime. The Cab and Syrah influences charge through the dense, substantial tannins and meatier notes of leather, cigar box and oak.","Red","Red Blend","US",76780
"25704","This is rich, almost unctuous, in terms of mouthfeel. That roundness, coupled with the bright golden hue, suggest that this wine may have been barrel aged. Some aromatic traces of talcum powder remain, drifting above chunky fruit flavors of pineapple and peach. The finish is full bodied and lightly toasty.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",25704
"60622","Browned butter, toasted almonds, sea salt and peach blossoms converge for a compelling nose on this twist-top appellation blend. It's a full Chardonnay on the sip, with Meyer lemon peel, Gala apple and savory sea salt, all cut by a racy line of acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",60622
"46052","Barrel fermented and aged in once-used French oak, this wine offers generous aromas of corn on the cob, corn silk, baked apple and spice. The flavors are silky and restrained, showing a lovely sense of balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",46052
"58638","Here's a straightforward Amarone, with dense black fruit and spice aromas. The palate delivers blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, with white pepper and chocolate accents. It doesn't have a lot of complexity, but is delicious and ready to drink.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58638

"80704","The price is right. It's soft and sweet, with jammy, candy flavors.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80704
"36268","An astonishing nose of peach and bramble with refreshing accents of lemon zest. The intense, off-dry palate of pistachio, pecan and apricot lead to a long, minerally finish. Carries its hefty 15.5% alcohol well. Best now to 2016.","White","Pinot Gris","France",36268
"59490","From an estate to the east of the town of Saint-Émilion, this rich wine shows its alcohol in the pepper edge that cuts through the fruit. It tastes firm still and has extracted bitter flavors. The acidity does give the wine a lift and lets the black currant fruit come through. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",59490
"33665","Made with Gewürztraminer and a drop of Sauvignon grapes that are left to dry for four months, this opens with aromas of nectarine, rose petal and baking spice. The rich, lingering palate delivers dried apricot, orange zest and candied fruit. Fresh acidity balances the sweet flavors.","White","White Blend","Italy",33665
"91927","This is a rich, full-bodied wine in a generally light and crisp field. It has the heft and texture of more substantial varietals—and indeed has Sémillon, Flora and Chardonnay blended in. It also offers a touch of sweetness and straightforward apple and Anjou pear flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",91927
"12371","This wine smells like an ice cream sundae, with scents of mint-chocolate chip and cookie dough, plus touches of strawberry and cherry sauce. Light to medium bodied, it has a malleable midpalate, but the tannins gain astringency on the finish. As the wine sits in the glass, the fruit seems to fall away, and the palate becomes more brittle feeling.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",12371
"2422","Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",2422
"7795","Minty, oaky, smoky aromas of ripe blackberry draw you towards a saturated, full-bodied palate with hard tannins.

Drink through 2028.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",7795
"90839","Using grapes sourced primarily from Lodi, this Merlot is oaky and smoky, expressing an aroma of cooked black olive. It also features a subtle and toasty berry cobbler flavor, and the finish is all cedar and caramel.","Red","Merlot","US",90839

"27104","Some overripe raisin flavors give this Zin a bitter taste, although it's totally dry. Shows flavors of chocolate and spicy blackberry jam.","Red","Zinfandel","US",27104
"68542","This brilliant straw colored Chardonnay has aromas of lemon blossoms and green apples. On the palate, it's smooth and clean with flavors of lemon curd and baked apple.","White","Chardonnay","Slovenia",68542
"88956","With each new vintage of Cuvée Elena, the blend of grapes and vineyards grows more complex, the vines older, the flavors more compact and captivating. A sophisticated and penetrating mix of strawberry and raspberry preserves, highlights of herb and spice, a dash of clean earth, and a lingering and detailed finish make this a wine to savor immediately while tucking away a few bottles to watch it evolve.","Red","Red Blend","US",88956
"25026","Faint suggestions of sweet smoke and beeswax mingle with the red apple and melon flavors, adding interest to this otherwise straightforward and easy drinking wine. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",25026

"2998","Soft, with slightly dilute flavors of blackberry and currant, surrounded by oak. Turns vegetal as it opens.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",2998
"23944","Soy, black fruit and asphalt aromas are strong on the nose of this wine by the Four Sisters project. The palate is varietally pure, with black pepper, tar and boysenberry. It dives a bit deeper as well, showing coffee and dark chocolate character.","Red","Syrah","US",23944
"54073","This is the inaugural release from this winery, which dedicates itself to the production of Grenache. A blend of fruit from Alder Ridge and Upland vineyards, it brings aromas of red plum, herb and spice that are followed by elegant, mouthwatering red-fruit flavors. It shows the variety's more delicate side.","Red","Grenache","US",54073
"70234","Unusual for Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Brunel's white is 80% Roussanne (the other 20% is Grenache Blanc). It's a lush, fruit-forward style, with ripe pineapple and peach elements that nonetheless show surprising lift and freshness on the long finish. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",70234
"22030","Sweetly caramelized, smoky oak, with all of its vanilla and wood sap flavors, dominates this wine, although it does have a considerable framework of raspberries and cherries. Feels a bit one-dimensional, but it's a pretty Pinot Noir, from a good address.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",22030
"27004","A robust, rustic red wine for drinking now with stews, burgers, vegetarian rice and bean dishes in red sauce. The winery doesn't tell us the varietal blend, but it's ripened to the limits of raisins, and high in alcohol, with a resulting glyceriny sweetness.","Red","Red Blend","US",27004
"5046","A barrel by barrel selection results in this reserve-level cuvée. Round, forward, spicy and toasty, it's a solid, almost chunky style with bold black-cherry fruit. Barrel aging brings up highlights of coffee and toast. Think duck confit with this bottle, and enjoy it over the next few years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5046

"61346","Now mature, this smoky, wood-aged wine is rich and complex. It has firm and dry tannins that are typical of the Tannat although these are a part of a solid, dark wine.

"47654","Aromas of licorice and barrel spice are light and elusive. The plum and dark-fruit flavors are tart and tangy with a velvety feel.","Red","Malbec","US",47654
"68915","The aromas of herbal berry seem crusty and roasted. The palate feels round, with herbal, burnt flavors of berry fruits surrounded by spice and warmth. It turns toward molasses and syrup on the medium-long, powerful finish. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Cabernet Franc and Syrah.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",68915
"73432","Herbal and spicy, here's an easygoing Merlot that's perfect for entertaining. Pepper and anise add character to the black fruit core, and the pronounced acidity keeps things lively and clean on the finish.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",73432
"56154","Dry, tannic and ripe, with flavors of black currant, raisin and a coating of spicy oak. The tannins are rich and thick and high alcohol gives this wine a slight burn, but richly sauced barbecue flavors balance that out.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",56154
"74437","One of the few Syrahs from this cool-climate vineyard on the appellation's western edge, this bottling is an expert take on savory, with black and white papper, crushed rosemary, potpourri, oregano and anise seed spicing up the fresh-pressed boysenberry fruit. A wondrous array of peppercorns and tart black fruit show once sipped, with elderberry and underripe black currants mixed amongst fennel, dill, oregano and charred meats.","Red","Syrah","US",74437

"73125","A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect.

"56389","This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",56389
"90088","This yellow-tinted blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay smells more like freshly waxed floorboards and wood resin than fruit. In the mouth, this is resiny and plump, with mild acidity. A weird set of woody, waxy flavors falls flat on the finish.","White","White Blend","Chile",90088
"28793","Featuring a unique and intriguingly fresh and floral nose, this shows bright strawberry, fresh-pressed hibiscus flowers, exotic vanilla-cinnamon notes and hints of slate and chaparral. The palate is just a hair less exciting, with raspberry, cranberry, white pepper, white sage and dried mint, all wrapped with tart acidity and tannins.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28793
"25524","A medium-weight contender whose fruit struggles to be acknowledged above the oak. There are some dark cherry and cocoa notes, especially on the nose, but in the end the oak rules, through the toasty, medium-length finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",25524
"57668","Big and rich, front-loaded with blackberry and cherry jam fruit. The tannins are considerable, giving the wine a full-bodied mouthfeel, like Grenache. Delicious, but a bit ponderous now for a Pinot Noir. Give it a few years in the cellar to mellow.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57668

"71239","Defines what makes this appellation great for Cabernet, but also why it won't rival Napa anytime soon. Brilliantly ripe fruit, lovely balance, such a pretty taste of the earth and, in this case, expensive oak. But there's that extra something it aspires to and doesn't quite achieve. It has to do with complexity of tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71239
"25943","High-toned berry and cherry aromas introduce this easy drinking, yet nicely structured Pinot Noir. The palate is ripe with blueberry and plum flavors, but bolstered by tart cranberry acidity and a flurry of fresh green herbs. Soft tannins carry out the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Romania",25943
"56833","As bright as a button, this is a crisp, cool wine, lightly herbaceous and deliciously fresh. Just touched by six months wood aging, the wine has an extra layer of richness that contrasts with the young green and citrus fruits. Drink now, or, better, keep until 2016.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",56833
"92128","The highest priced among the four different Grüners produced at the winery, this elegant wine has the depth of the Reserve, the minerality of the Dolium, and riper flavors than either, with peach and melon dominating. Drink this slightly chilled and it will pair beautifully with just about all poultry and seafood.","White","Grüner Veltliner","US",92128
"76278","Except for a splash of Syrah, this qualifies as a Cabernet-centric Bordeaux-style blend. Hard to find a better bottle of blended red wine at the price. This has grip and breed, with tart red fruits, ripe tannins, a wash of herb and tart acidity. Put it up against anything you grill.","Red","Red Blend","US",76278
"24064","The label doesn't tell us what the blend is, but it's a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel. The texture is soft, and the flavors are rich and ripe in cherries, currants and spicy, umami teriyaki. Earns an extra point for sheer likeability.","Red","Red Blend","US",24064
"53506","A lively, flavorful and well-balanced red made of a Bordeaux grape generally reserved for blending. Its bright berry aromas and flavors are offset by attractive black pepper and green tobacco accents. Good fruit, positive acidity and a firm, even tannic structure mean this stylish, elegant wine has a future. Drink now through 2007, best after 2004. —M.M.","Red","Petit Verdot","Spain",53506

"22821","Rich and ripe, this has a plushness of red currant and cassis counterbalanced by blackberry on the underbelly. A well-hewn texture leans leathery, with seasonings of black pepper giving it a piquant and lengthy finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22821
"19155","Fontanafredda's Moscato d'Asti is a cut above its competitors, with intense orange, grape and pear aromas that lead into a palate of white grapes and ground cherries. The medium finish is intensely sweet but an underlying freshness saves it from being cloying. Drink with a plate of mixed fruit.","White","Moscato","Italy",19155
"86800","Slight touches of smoked meat, iron, slate, cranberry, raspberry and dried sage show on the nose of this wine. The palate is a bit weak, with tangy strawberry and rust flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86800
"66481","Red apple, honeysuckle, Key lime and the slightest hint of flint show on the nose of this bottling from a Temecula producer. Broad white-peach flavors imbue the palate, cut by sour citrus and marmalade touches.","White","Chardonnay","US",66481
"10932","On first take, this smells ripe and raisiny, with accents of marzipan, cigar box and baked berries. The palate is blocky in feel, with big tannins and a sense of richness. Baked, earthy, chocolaty berry flavors reflect a hot vintage, while the finish is chocolaty and spicy. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",10932
"50936","This Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend is all fruit, black currants with fresh acidity. The tannins are still young and firm, and need to soften. Fresh and fruity, the wine will develop quickly and can be drunk from late 2016.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",50936

It's smooth and rich with a powerful blast of cherry on the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",58625
"58908","The nose just hints at earth and autumnal oak leaf. The palate comes with slight grip, very fine tannins and more earthy leafy aromas. Red-cherry fruit is just hinted at. This is slender and bone dry and will come into its own when served with subtle mushroom or game dishes.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",58908
"29333","This white is barrel fermented and then aged further sur lie in a mix of French oak, stainless steel and concrete egg, with the goal of additional texture and complexity coming into play.

Light bodied, it doesn't hold back on mouthfeel, offering richness without overripeness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",29333
"8346","Smoky and a bit stark with whiffs of struck flint and stone. This off-dry Riesling is piercing on the palate with nervy lime-juice and lime-skin flavors. The finish is medium long, ending on a softly floral, crushed-stone note.","White","Riesling","US",8346
"36318","This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor.","Red","Red Blend","US",36318
"69028","This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne. Its mineral texture and light oxidative character from the use of wood is contrasted with the tight citrus fruitiness and nervy steely texture. The wine is just mature although still with plenty of fruit. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",69028

"2721","Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.","White","Chardonnay","US",2721

"237","While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",237

"92220","Scents of dark chocolate greet you immediately; woven into the palate are delicate, feminine Pinot Noir fruit flavors.

"85655","The estate Syrah immediately shows a toastier nose and richer fruit than the excellent Columbia Valley bottling. Along with cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit are powerful layers of toasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee. At the moment the wine seems still to be holding something back; decanting and substantial breathing time are highly recommended.","Red","Syrah","US",85655

These are joined by tangy, zesty grapefruit freshness, creating a concentrated fruit-driven palate of great tension and concentration. This is a wonderful tightrope act between tang and generosity. The finish is long and clean.","White","Riesling","Austria",82274
"71628","This full-bodied, concentrated wine is dry, quite firm and tannic in texture. It smells rich and a bit earthy, and tastes like blackberries, cranberries and beef. The style will accompany rich, meaty food very well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71628
"69049","Red berry, menthol, grilled sage, leather and a whiff of oak lead the nose. The palate boasts a weightless concentration, offering raspberry compote, oak-driven spice, white pepper, licorice and a mineral vein that weave together around a backbone of fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2019–2029.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",69049
"38161","This is a soft, medium-dry wine, layered with fresh fruits, touches of tropical flavors and good acidity, a reflection of the vintage. It's a bright wine, lightly textured and ready to drink from the end of 2015.","White","Pinot Gris","France",38161
"31048","Scattered aromas of black olive and stewed berry fruits lead to a heavy, awkward palate. This tastes strained, with burnt, leafy black-fruit flavors and a soft, low-acid finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",31048
"25954","Fox Run's  Geology Series is a remarkable study of Finger Lakes terroir and winemaking, and the 11 Riesling is a particularly fantastic result. Inoculated using the pied de cuve method, this semisweet Riesling shows apple and floral notes. A lush, textured palate is brimming with apricot and peach flavors. It's a complex wine layered with minerality, fruit and floral tones, and has an exceptionally long finish.","White","Riesling","US",25954
"81563","Sweet, ripe and black in style, with good structure and a little bit of heat and weight. The mouth offers ripe tannins, depth and balance, and the flavors of cassis, black cherry and fine herbs work in tandem. Smooth, with an easy dusting of cocoa on the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",81563
"96394","This is a Chardonnay that showcases the best of what South Africa can offer: fresh fruit, elegant minerality, good value. The nose of citrus and flowers is both flirty and sophisticated, and the palate is friendly but complex, with mingling fruit and spice. Everything about the wine makes an impression  from start to finish.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",96394
"76420","This shows Savigny's softness and approachability, along with tannins and acids. It is firmly concentrated, creating a wine that feels complete, juicy and rich.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",76420
"38416","Creamy and buttery, this Chardonnay provides satisfying vanilla and tropical fruit flavors that finish on a honeyed note.","White","Chardonnay","US",38416
"30234","Inviting aromas of dark cherry, spicy bramble fruit and warm vanilla show brightly on the nose. The palate brings ripe flavors of blackcurrant and dark cherry, with mildly grippy tannins providing a solid structure. A lightly peppered note mildly lingers on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",30234
"102025","Aromas of ripe dark berry, oak, coconut and a whiff of roasted coffee bean lead the nose. The bracing palate offers stewed plum, dried black cherry, toasted hazelnut and a green note of powdered sage alongside close-grained tannins that leave a rather grippy finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",102025
"63030","Pure Merlot from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this finished its fermentation in concrete egg, then spent 20 months in 100% new French oak, and another two years in bottle prior to release. Tightly wound and dense with cherry and chocolate layered throughout, it brings in flavors of red licorice and baking spices. The tannins are silky and the structure and flavors are bold.","Red","Merlot","US",63030
"40906","Some 18 months of oak aging gave this wine loads of density, intensity and length on the finish. It opens with bright aromas of ripe berry, leather, tar, resin and maple syrup.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",40906
"39704","lean and zesty Chardonnay with a burst of mouthwatering acidity, like a squirt of lime juice. It's a pretty thin wine, but with pleasant citrus and vanilla flavors, and not bad for the price.","White","Chardonnay","US",39704
"96971","A blend of several vineyard sites, including Riddle and Pratt, this is a knockout, a testament to fine winemaking in its soft, velvety texture and buoyant acidity and structure. Orange and strawberry provide a tangy ripeness complemented in earth and clove. This is one worth stocking up on.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96971
"50117","Produced from two parcels in Aloxe Corton, this structured wine has red-plum fruitiness that is still masked by a dry tannic coating. It has concentration and good potential. Drink this textured, firm wine from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",50117
"30071","There is good integrity of fruit, but there are also slight distractions in the form of stewy or earthy tones. Otherwise, it delivers blackberry, coffee grinds and smoked almond with rigid tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",30071
"40333","While its briary, red berried fruit expression is pristine, there's an Old-World anchor to this Cabernet Franc. It's brambly and a bit herbal, but bright and fresh, framed firmly by tart acidity and velvety tannins. The palate is supple and silky with a long, persistent finish. Drinks well now but should improve till at least 2021.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",40333
"96040","Aromas of geraniums, celery and grassy fruits lead the nose, while flavors of green, soupy red berries finish stemmy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",96040
"7602","The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020–2030.","Red","Grenache","Australia",7602
"18873","Mildly intense scents of dark berries and ripe plum meld with warm aromas of vanilla and oak on this Sangiovese-based wine. It has a gripping mouthfeel with juicy black cherry, toast and cinnamon-spice accompanied by solid tannins that last through the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",18873
"50892","This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty. A bit ungainly now, but should gain in the cellar. Better after 2013.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50892
"15352","Jammy aromas of crushed boysenberry and cassis are rich and ripe. This is a direct, fruit-forward Merlot with moderate but noticeable acidity and a generous baked-blackberry flavor that finishes warm, toasty and with ample depth. Drink through 2017.","Red","Merlot","Chile",15352
"36066","Full in the nose, with leather and muted red and black fruit. The palate is big and oaky, with flavors of black plum and milk chocolate, and the finish is of modest length, with size and some tannins. This wine has all the typical Merlot characteristics, but in short order.","Red","Merlot","Chile",36066
"52566","Starts off with some intriguing notes of musk and spice, the turns intensely sweet, with powerful honey and orange marmalade flavors that coat the mouth and refuse to leave. There's just too much sugar in the end, and not enough acid or minerality to provide the ideal balance. Still, it is impressive, and if you measure pleasure solely by grams per liter of residual sugar, this will surely strike gold.","White","Riesling","Germany",52566
"30971","Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",30971
"44626","Dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, although it's certainly well made and delicious. Floods the mouth with cherry and raspberry pie-filling fruit, and the smoky, caramelized oak has a granola sweetness. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",44626
"37007","Almost all Pinots grown in these mountains south of San Francisco overlooking Silicon Valley need time in the bottle. This one certainly does. Right now, it's tannic and acidic, and the primary raspberry, cherry and blood orange flavors are reaching out to—but haven't found, much less embraced—the French oak. Give it a good 4–5 years in the cellar.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37007
"37952","Extremely seductive aromas of caramel, toasted oak, beach campfire, blackberry, black cherry and thin mint cookies welcome the nose to this bottling. The palate is equally complex and inviting, with milk chocolate, cherry pie, smoked pork and dried oregano flavors, tongue-tantalizing all around.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",37952
"93737","Generous fruit rises from the glass: Juicy pear and red apple, mellowed with a dollop of yeasty roundedness. The palate is supple, fresh and crunchy. Everything here is appetizing and moreish. This is easy but fun. Drink soon.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",93737
"82265","Fermented partially in old clay amphoras, this is a rich wine that has managed to retain freshness as well. The blend includes Grand Noir, a grape with red juice, as well as Trincadeira and Aragonez. Its density is revealed as it opens up, giving ripe red fruits, solid tannins and a dry core. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",82265
"7751","This wine is from the Chenoweth grape-growing family and is made from three of its finest vineyard sites: Chenoweth Ranch, Treehouse and Bootleggers, all special spots that have produced grapes for special producers. Here, the result is a smooth and velvety expression of juicy cherry and raspberry, given freshness via vibrant acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7751
"8623","Cherry, cassis, leather and mineral aromas make for a lively bouquet. This is round and full on the palate, with welcome division among its layers. Ripe blackberry, fig and chocolate flavors finish lightly baked and heady, showing depth. Drink through 2018.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",8623
"10087","Well-made, with clean, bright fruit and lots of pretty new oak. The wine is beautifully balanced, elegant with a long, rich, toasty finish. Fairly light fruit in this vintage, but well handled and perfectly showcased.","Red","Zinfandel","US",10087
"30309","Ripe, fruity Chardonnay, with toast flavors balancing with smooth apricot and pear juice. The wine is soft, rich and generous, finishing with a light acidity.","White","Chardonnay","Portugal",30309
"18007","Tartness and moderate tannins lend plenty of mouth-puckering grip to this medium-bodied wine, and that tartness comes off as a touch of raspberry vinegar on the palate. It has an appealing earthy, iron-like quality and a definite textural bite.","Red","Primitivo","US",18007
"55159","You won't miss the taste of oak one bit, because this Chard is so rich and crisply stimulating on its own. It floods the palate with pineapple jam, peach pie, green apple butter, vanilla and cinnamon-honey granola flavors that are clean and pure.","White","Chardonnay","US",55159
"42375","The aromas are generous, with notes of spice box, blue and purple fruit, pencil lead, barrel spice and vanilla. It's silky and sumptuous, showing a pleasing sense of texture and an extended finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42375
"51544","A nice, Beaune-style Pinot, rich in cherry and spice fruit, with good oak and medium-bodied. It's balanced in acids and tannins, with a smooth mouth feel, a good food wine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51544
"7049","Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and a drop of Petit Verdot, this polished linear red has aromas of black-skinned fruit, bell pepper, coconut and toasted oak. The vibrant, elegantly structured palate offers black currant, chopped herb, clove and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",7049
"102258","This opens with restrained aromas of vanilla, berry and a floral note. The informal, easy-drinking palate offers tart cherry, raspberry and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity. It's not very intense and already extremely accessible so drink soon.","Red","Barbera","Italy",102258
"46671","Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie for 10 months, this elegant Chardonnay offers immaculate scents and flavors of lemon rind and pith, a dusting of spice, and a generous slice of ripe apple. It's full and luscious in the mouth, with appealing texture, barrel toast and just a pat of butter in the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",46671
"68898","The emphasis here is on fresh, floral fragrances that give this wine a bright, springtime feel. Peach and lemon blossoms steal the show and the wine has a cool, easy feel in the mouth.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",68898
"50036","A few famous names have dipped into the Ovello cru for grapes and Cascina Morassino is part of that elite group. Facing the church steeple of Barbaresco, the vineyard delivers smoky notes of tar and asphalt backed by ripe fruit and cedar wood. There's a wild, messy character to this wine that is charming.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",50036
"83286","This is a very firm, tight and focused effort, with a clean cherry flavor. It is not at all like most Washington Merlots, which are often heavily influenced by new oak aging. Here is a concise, pure expression that may come across as a little monochromatic, perhaps because it seems to be somewhat shut down at the moment. Made using grapes from 10-year-old vines, it shows great promise.","Red","Merlot","US",83286
"33794","Salinic and also melony on the mostly clean and crisp nose. The palate is healthy, with round, lightly pithy flavors of green melon, peach and kiwi. Citrusy on the finish and a little green on the fade out. Good for summer quaffing. Drink this year.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",33794
"31447","An attention-grabbing sense of umami introduces this wine, with darkly colored mushrooms, plum sauce, miso soup and black sage tickling the nose. There is dark chocolate with bits of espresso on the palate, which is leveled by plum skins and berry flesh, with bitter tar and black pepper on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",31447
"35374","Black plum, blackberries, lilac and vanilla show on the easy if simple nose of this bottling. There's a load of perfume-like purple flowers on the sip, where a curiously strong acidity also carries cola spice.","Red","Malbec","US",35374
"95294","The color is a deep copper, while aromas suggest chocolate and vanilla, and the flavors are buttery and rich. Together with a thick texture it makes for a full-bodied rosé that will be more of a dinner wine than something for a sunny outdoor lunch.","Rosé","Rosé","US",95294
"50239","This is entirely stainless fermented, fresh out of the tank, with plenty of lift and spice. It's not a complicated wine, but the flavors of lime and white peach, jicama and cucumber are most refreshing, and there's a hint of white pepper adding zest to the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",50239
"14499","This elegant Pinot Bianco boasts typical varietal sensations of spring flowers, Alpine herbs and green apples. The savory but reserved palate offers juicy apples, citrus, a hint of mineral and lively acidity. Pair it with appetizers, light fish dishes or as sip as an apéritif. Omniwines, Astor Wines.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",14499
"105640","This botrytized wine came from 2011 vintage grapes that were not harvested until February 2012. A light-golden color, it's bright with aromas of dried apples, pears and flowers. It's sweet (170g/L residual sugar) but not weighty, retaining a sense of lightness and elegance.","White","Riesling","US",105640
"15250","Ripe, fruity and tannic, this shows lusty flavors of cherry and raspberry jam that finish sweet and spicy. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel.","Red","Red Blend","US",15250
"91113","Quite a good Cabernet, especially at this price. They blended some other varieties, including Zinfandel, Malbec and Petite Sirah, which bring extra layers. It's a fine everyday wine—fruity, spicy, full-bodied and dry.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",91113
"90109","Plump and ripe Montmorency cherry kicks off the aromas on this bottling, followed by rain-on-slate minerality, slight hints of cola and a growing sense of sour cranberry. The palate also begins with riper red fruit before diving into extreme minerality and intriguing texture. Then comes tart plums and cranberries, all dusted by savory touches of white pepper. It's quite a ride.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",90109
"27119","Almond skin, green banana and pool water aromas precede a spritzy, citric, acidic palate. Flavors of white grapefruit, melon and apple finish zesty and briny, with a citric aftertaste similar to a gin & tonic.","White","Verdejo","Spain",27119
"71676","Fruity while also structured, this is a solid wine. It has juicy acidity, ripe red fruit and layers of spicy toasty wood. Drink this wine from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",71676
"90385","Here's a nicely clean and compact Barbera d'Asti with pretty, albeit simple, aromas of wild fruit, pomegranate juice and fresh blueberries. You'll enjoy the aromatic purity of this wine—which shows little sign of interference in the winery—and the overall crispness of the fruit.","Red","Barbera","Italy",90385
"8241","Pretty coffee notes are offset by ripe aromas of raspberry, black cherry and chocolate: There is nice softness and density in this wine that is balanced against the natural acidity of the fruit. Pair this wine with cheesy pasta al forno.","Red","Barbera","Italy",8241
"97875","Earthy and gritty cherry, tomato and herbal aromas set up a grabby, sticky, caramelized palate. Flavors of brown sugar and generic berry fruits finish with a hint of sweet chocolate. This is good but short on traditional Pinot Noir character.","Red","Pinot Noir","Argentina",97875
"101581","This Pinot Noir is softer and more approachable than many of Swan's other new releases, so it's probably not as age worthy. But it feels smooth on the palate, and the flavors of raspberry cream, cherry pie and buttered toast are luscious.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101581
"86098","Reddish-orange in color, this is a high-toned, citrus-laden wine that retains fresh flavors of grapefruit and mandarin orange. It stays crisp and dry on the palate, with just a tiny suggestion of its time in neutral oak. Pomegranate and a tang of sour cherry finish things off.","Red","Syrah","US",86098
"53707","Neutral white-fruit aromas of peach, nectarine and melon are welcoming. This quaffer is juicy like orange juice, while flavors of mixed citrus fruits and nectarine finish peachy and lively, with a slight bitterness coming on late.","White","Pinot Gris","Argentina",53707
"61920","Like a Beaujolais Nouveau, this is a lively, grapey wine, with fresh-from-the-fermenter flavors of raspberries, red cherries, cinnamon and pepper.","Rosé","Rosé","US",61920
"88832","This is a structured wine whose fruit is still coming through the tannins. It has a dry core, layers of acidity and juicy bitter cherry acidity. Drink from the end of 2016.","Red","Gamay","France",88832
"96522","Bruce McGuire makes a strong case for the potential of Petit Verdot—a variety not often bottled on its own—in the Santa Ynez Valley. Baked blackberry, licorice and cocoa scents show on the playful nose, while black cherry, cocoa dust, cardamom and anise flavors light up the palate.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",96522
"96269","Lifted notes of chamomile and marzipan, of pear, beeswax and dried lemon zests are already present. The palate subsumes all these flavors into a harmonious, fluid whole. This is textured and complex, with the merest hint of sweetness but finishing absolutely dry.","White","Pinot Gris","France",96269
"101858","Attractive spice and green-fruit aromas lead to this fresh, ripe wine. Touches of wood give a spicy buttery taste that contrasts easily with the flavors. Fruity with a light mineral character, it is ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",101858
"44115","Touches of menthol and pine flavors set this wine apart from the crowd, dominating the fruit flavors from the aroma to the finish. It is medium to full bodied, tastes a little earthy and smoky, and is relatively lean in texture.","Red","Zinfandel","US",44115
"56468","Half barrel fermented, and all oak-aged (roughly two-thirds new), this cloaks the lush fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and nectarine in a wash of caramel. The wine remains well proportioned, with acids and barrel toast playing a supporting role.","White","Chardonnay","Canada",56468
"57261","This ripe, semisweet wine has oodles of fruit flavors, full body and a richness that's well suited for chocolate desserts or a cheese course.","Red","Red Blend","US",57261
"23586","Made entirely with Sangiovese, the nose reveals red berry and French oak aromas, while the palate offers unripe strawberry, clove and cedar. Rather astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",23586
"68259","Aromas of toasted oak, candied citrus, pressed white flower and vanilla lead the nose and follow through to the palate, along with nectarine zest and baked apricot. Enjoy soon to capture the remaining freshness and fruit.","White","Garganega","Italy",68259
"79408","This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",79408
"30385","Golden yellow coloring and deeply perfumed notes of dried flowers and stone fruits are enticing hints to this wine's extended skin contact during fermentation. But the palate of this dry, light-bodied Riesling seems demure with pressed apple and pear flavors that struggle to penetrate through.","White","Riesling","US",30385
"84373","The winery's first release off its estate vineyard in The Rocks offers expressive, captivating aromas of peat, dried flowers, fire pit, herbs, grilled asparagus, funk and green olive. The flavors are sweet, sumptuous and rich, showing depth and detail. It's a knockout.","Red","Syrah","US",84373
"64458","Lithe and slick, this has broad apple flavors and loose acids.","White","Chardonnay","US",64458
"37715","This precious vin santo opens with lovely aromas of caramel, butterscotch, vanilla bean and toasted honey-coated almond. There's a resiny feel in the mouth that is typical of this carefully aged dessert wine, and the close is sweet and tart at the same time.","White","White Blend","Italy",37715
"50053","A touch of spritz adds extra zip to this vibrantly youthful Riesling. It's dancingly light on the palate, but sweet yellow-peach and mango flavors penetrate deeply. It's a thoroughly enjoyable sip for youthful consumption at a fantastic bargain price.","White","Riesling","Germany",50053
"21030","Lemony and high-strung, this is a light, bright and low-in-oak wine from an appellation better known for varieties like Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc. It works though, providing a tension of acidity with citrusy concentration.","White","Chardonnay","US",21030
"19128","There's a tannic flatness to this 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 12% Malbec and 12% Petit Verdot blended in. The crunchy blackberry and cassis fall somewhat flat on the palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",19128
"79379","Scratchy black cherry aromas come with a strong hint of tree bark and cedar resin. This feels snappy at first, then more resiny and oaky upon airing. Woody black-fruit flavors get a boost from juicy acidity, while an oaky finish tastes like mint and licorice.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",79379
"47852","Ripe and fruity, this has a rich texture that comes both from the generous white fruits and from the cut of lemon acidity. A mineral-textured wine, it's crisp now and will likely round out to bring out the ripeness. Drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",47852
"89529","Aromas of underbrush, leather, tar and game lead the nose. The earthy aromas carry over to the palate along with mature plum, juicy black cherry, truffle, tobacco and graphite. Smooth tannins soften up the wine's rustic, forward nature.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",89529
"46606","With no new oak, La Sereinité is indeed serene, textured and round with vibrant acidity. The aromatics do the talking first, inviting one in with nuanced white peach, orange blossom and lime before the palate develops over time into richer, fuller flavors of crème brûlée. Throughout, the wine is balanced and expressive.","White","Chardonnay","US",46606
"104460","This estate beauty offers a depth of cola spice and lovely acidity, with just a hint of underlying richness. From a site that's slightly more coastal than the vineyards around the producer's winery, it shows savory characteristics of rhubarb and wild strawberry amid a plushness of forest, all within supportive, integrated oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104460
"49066","Solid and firm, this initially tannic wine has ripe black fruits under the tough surface. It will take time to bring out the potential richness and complex flavors. Wait until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",49066
"15026","Dry and gritty, with rugged tannins and lots of acidity. Unfortunately, the fruit just isn't powerful enough to stand up to it, making this Merlot tough to like.","Red","Merlot","US",15026
"54953","Vigorous and tannic, this young Pinot is hard right now. It also seems a little unbalanced, with some raisins and mint bracketing the cherries. Could just be going through an awkward youth. Try in 2011.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54953
"76956","This is a fruit-driven wine showing lots of apple and melon aromas, broad peach and apple flavors and a generous texture. It's very tasty and refreshing and has touch of sweetness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",76956
"85632","Lovely tart cranberry and just-ripe blueberry appear on the nose. The palate presents similarly appetizing crunchy red fruit that's pure and unpretentiously delicious, spiced with cinnamon and white pepper and brimming with freshness and verve. Don't let the light body deceive you; this has depth and will develop. Drink now–2025.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",85632
"5472","An attention-grabbing sense of umami introduces this wine, with darkly colored mushrooms, plum sauce, miso soup and black sage tickling the nose. There is dark chocolate with bits of espresso on the palate, which is leveled by plum skins and berry flesh, with bitter tar and black pepper on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",5472
"101068","Jammy raspberry, currant and caramel flavors are countered with acidic sharpness and high alcohol in this Zinfandel. It tastes a bit unbalanced, but a juicy cheeseburger will handle it well.","Red","Zinfandel","US",101068
"49284","A fruit-challenged nose makes for an unpromising begining. Thankfully, things pick up in the mouth, with cherry cola and wet earth overlaying hints of barnyard and grilled nuts. Solid, if somewhat uninspiring.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",49284
"63610","On the sweet side, but it's also crisp, with enough zesty acidity to provide balance. Floral, apple-y and refreshingly light, this is a fine picnic wine. A chalky note gives added depth to the finish.","White","Riesling","US",63610
"97210","Classic Nebbiolo aromas of red berry, underbrush, tilled soil, aromatic herb and spice lead the nose. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, anisette, mocha, toast and grilled herb alongside extremely assertive tannins and brisk acidity. Drink 2019–2031.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",97210
"50548","This proves that sparkling wine does not have to be bone-dry to be sophisticated. Although moderately sweet, it is complex in aroma, elegant in texture and balance, rich in flavor and long on the finish. An appealing fresh-bread aroma leads to rich poached-pear flavors. This will be great with an after-dinner cheese course.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",50548
"15425","A tight, rich, dense package, wrapped in just the right amount of French oak. Black cherries are blended with foresty aromas and a dark earthy richness reminiscent of humus. It’s all capped by wonderfully vivid and balanced acidity that gives a little extra length to the chocolate-cherry finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15425
"73984","There's a burnt toast quality on the nose of this otherwise soft Barbera and a lingering aftertaste of that same toast.","Red","Barbera","US",73984
"22113","Soft and easy, with very ripe blackberry and currant flavors that veer into chocolate-covered raisins. Finishes a bit hot, but dry.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",22113
"78684","Delicate but enticing aromas of white peach and wisteria float from the glass. The lively, linear palate shows Granny Smith apple, Kaiser pear, citrus zest and a ginger note alongside crisp—almost crackling—acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",78684
"70162","This is a rich, full and structured wine with a great balance between black fruit and tannins. It shows the stony minerality of the Douro, with generous fruit and acidity. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",70162
"99360","This unusual blend of Lagrein and Grignolino is quite dark in color for a rosé, and also feels and tastes heavy and sweet. It's a fruity wine, but lacks the delicacy you want in a fine blush.","Rosé","Rosé","US",99360
"2385","Give this brisk, young Pinot 5–6 years in the cellar to mellow. It's clearly a very fine wine, clean and elegantly constructed, with rich tannins and a bright squirt of acidity framing ripe cherry, currant and licorice flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",2385
"23888","Coming from a block of Clone 15 grapes that overlooks the historic San Ramon Chapel, this offers approachable, inviting aromas of sea salt, lemon-butter cookies and peach brûlée. An line of oyster shell minerality runs down the center of the palate but it is surrounded by warm oak and ripe flesh of apples, pears, white peach and pineapple.","White","Chardonnay","US",23888
"58016","While showing sweetness, this wine also manages to retain great freshness. It's delicious, with bright green plum fruitiness as well as weight and richness. It will be a great food wine, but wait until 2018.","White","Pinot Gris","France",58016
"50310","Light apple-blossom aromas are harmless. In the mouth, this Chardonnay-based blend is flat and buttery in feel, with baked apple and peach flavors before a flat finish.","White","White Blend","Spain",50310
"91858","This red starts with aromas of dried forest fruit, crushed herbs and red fruit, and on the palate, classic, elegant waves of dried fruit, spice and black pepper. Spicy and dry but softened at the edges by cherry fruit, it's a classy red with versatile pairing ability.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",91858
"13455","Warm while also fresh, this rounded wine is full of red fruits, lit up by a touch of spice and freshened with acidity. Clean and crisp, it's just bursting with fruit at the end.","Rosé","Rosé","France",13455
"73475","Ripe, tropical fruit aromas mark this spicy, well-made wine. The aromas veer toward breadfruit, mango and even banana, with Oriental spice notes of ginger and cinnamon. Drinks rich and powerful, with up-front fruit, and finishes long and spicy.","White","Chardonnay","US",73475
"46498","A rich, smoky style of wine that revels in its high toast character as well as ripe yellow fruit flavors. It is certainly full in the mouth, a burst of ripeness followed by balancing acidity and a texture of red apple skins. It would be worth aging for another year.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",46498
"106432","A level portion of this premier cru, called Les Plateaux, is the origin of this wine. As befits a wine from Nuits Saint-Georges, it is dark with tannins as well as fruit. It has a good structure, with dense blackberry and plum flavors that are developing. Give this wine until 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",106432
"24022","Lovely, dense aromas of dried flowers, herbs, cherries and chocolate immediately capture attention. This is a superbly elegant wine, with both precision and power. Orange-peel flavors highlight deep cherry compote, with tension, balance and length in abundance.","Red","Pinot Noir","Canada",24022
"92794","This wine all comes from Red Heaven Vineyard. Aromas of barrel spice, dark fruit and black licorice are followed by full-bodied black-fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins, with baking spice flavors lingering on the finish. It provides a lot of appeal.","Red","Syrah","US",92794
"7502","Initially a bit closed, this opens with aromas of leather, leafy underbrush, tilled soil, wild berry and a whiff of cellar floor. The palate is still primary, displaying red cherry, sage and menthol alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2018.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",7502
"39753","Waxy, weird aromas of lemon and ham are all over the map. This feels heavy, with a sense of sugary weight. Chunky flavors of cured pork and creamy melon finish plump but amorphous.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",39753
"76486","After this medium-bodied, fresh-styled Rioja opens with scratchy plum and berry aromas, hints of chocolate and light oak step in. The mouthfeel is wiry and fresh, with vibrant acidity creating high-toned, red-fruit flavors that finish with ringing zest.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",76486
"53660","This straightforward, inviting Barolo boasts classic Nebbiolo aromas of rose, leather, berry spice and tilled earth. It's not loaded with complexity, but the sour cherry, black pepper and clove flavors are delicious. It closes on a note of subtle oak alongside a drying, tannic finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",53660
"100046","An especially deep-gold color and enticing, expansive aromas indicate the extra aging time this Pinot Noir-based bubbly went through. Ripe pear, honey and toasted-almond notes weave across the palate as a rich mouthfeel is picked up by fine yet persistent bubbles. It is a delicious, mature wine that shows how complex and rewarding California sparkling wine can be with time. Keep through 2022.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",100046
"83177","Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 7% Syrah and 6% Merlot, this presents wonderfully pure, expressive notes of mint, cassis and vanilla. It just lacks that extra touch of textural richness to put it in the top category. A prebottling sample of the 2007 was more impressive.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",83177
"28480","This Pinot tastes so oaky, it's like chewing on barrel staves. Notes of vanilla, buttered toast and the creamy-sweet flavor of oak sap completely overwhelm what otherwise seems like a good wine. This is a real outlier among MacPhail's other 2010 Pinot Noirs.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28480
"71659","A crazy amount of peppercorn, from white to black to green to red, pops on the nose of this bottling by the legendary Adam Tolmach. Aromas also convey dried violet, black gravel and the slightest touch of blueberry. The pepper spice is almost unbelievable on the sip, where it spices up the soy and coffee-bean flavors.","Red","Syrah","US",71659
"59798","This wine comes from a small parcel of 70-year-old vines within the Deschamps vineyard. It has great concentration and a dense structure. That contrasts with the complex black fruit and ripe berry flavors. Wood aging has smoothed the fruity edges. Drink this wine from late 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",59798
"63929","A streak of sharp acidity and green mint makes this wine too tart, despite some pleasant cherry, red currant, clove and cola flavors. The wine is unlikely to develop additional bottle complexity. Sourced from the Sanford & Benedict and La Rinconada vineyards.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63929
"103304","There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It's the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",103304
"46793","The aromas are of new wood and spice. But the red cherry flavors of Blaufränkisch are enough to absorb this wood, giving a spicy but fruity wine that happily fills the glass with ripe fruit.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",46793
"92139","Still rather harsh, this is a rustic wine with cherry, cola and prune flavors. It's not for aging.","Red","Merlot","US",92139
"9070","A blend of Sangiovese and 20% Canaiolo, it conveys spicy aromas of black pepper, spearmint and toast. The palate delivers black berry and cherry alongside bright acidity. Simple but well-made, it would pair well with hearty pasta dishes.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",9070
"37816","A bit thin on the blackberry fruit, and showing some veggie notes. Also pretty tannic. Might have seen its better days a year or so ago.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",37816
"100445","Red berry and cola aromas come with a cool menthol note. It feels chunky and jammy; the moderate-to-soft acidity creates a rubbery palate, with cherry and plum flavors. The finish turns sweet like caramel and slightly stewed.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",100445
"42354","Ripe and fruity, this is an attractive wine. It has a rich, spicy character from wood aging. It has a friendly, open character, making it ready to drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",42354
"59431","Fine tannins, dusty and sweet, play a major part in the success of this wine. It's fruit, initially subdued by the tannins, then bursts through with cherry jelly, dark plums and an edge of licorice. It's certainly rich, but it all hangs together well.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",59431
"102469","Aromas of cola, herb, barrel spice and cherry lead to plentiful cola flavors. The palate brings some heft but the tannins possess a slight sense of grittiness that distracts.","Red","Syrah","US",102469
"96081","Fruity while also lightly peppery, this is Fournier's entry-level Sancerre. It is juicy and crisp, delicious with lemon and gooseberry fruit. Still young, the wine will be better from 2017 as its budding fruitiness softens.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",96081
"70648","Wet leaf, black cherry, and assertive barrel flavors of brown sugar, maple syrup and crème brûlée are the dominant notes in this blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc. The short, slightly bitter, green finish is the downside.","Red","Tempranillo","US",70648
"97659","Oak jumps out first, both on the nose and on the palate, before waves of grenadine liqueur and raspberry take over. Velvety in texture, the wine is earthy, with well-integrated tannins and a lingering finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",97659
"62833","Savory apple and lemon scents open this delicately composed, but intensely minerally spätlese. The palate is ripe, with juicy yellow peach and orange flavors, anchored by earthy tones of crushed rock and slate that linger on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",62833
"15245","This Chardonnay has brisk, crisp acidity and flavors of pineapple, orange and mango. There are dominating notes of buttered toast and sweet butterscotch.","White","Chardonnay","US",15245
"35150","A lovely Merlot and, at this price, a compelling buy. Hard to find a better inexpensive all-around full-bodied red than this one. Fully dry, it has polished flavors of cherries, currants, anise and pepper, wrapped in a gentle, silky texture.","Red","Merlot","US",35150
"20217","This is a preview of Swan's vineyard-designated '09s yet to come, and it sure is exciting. It's a beautiful, sensual wine, rich in acidity and delicious in raspberries and cherries. Near perfect for drinking now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20217
"54868","Leesy aromas of pear and melon are friendly and fresh. This Verdejo is lean, citric and drawn on the palate, with lemon, white pineapple and green apple flavors. A tangy, tight, juicy, acidic palate ensures that this ends with crispness and snap.","White","Verdejo","Spain",54868
"30779","While this wine has the right piercing, shattering acidity of an eiswein, there's a toffee/caramel element that takes away from its purity. Perfumes are good, and there's a lively touch of white fruit.","White","Riesling","Austria",30779
"17218","Mealy apple and orange custard aromas set the stage for this ripe, fleshy white. There's a roundness to the mouthfeel, as those notes continue through to the palate, though the finish offers a pithy citrus astringency that helps to enliven the experience.","White","Chardonnay","France",17218
"9","This is a dry wine, very spicy, with a tight, taut texture and strongly mineral character layered with citrus as well as pepper. It's a food wine with its almost crisp aftertaste.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",9
"105381","Lush fruit and generous barrel notes blend in a wine with supple, forward fruit—strawberries especially. The tannins are polished and the finish loaded with caramel and butter. Easy-drinking, forward and full-bodied.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",105381
"35607","Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's already extremely accessible, so don't leave it in the cellar for too long. Drink 2016–2021.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",35607
"51328","Bold, medicinal and slightly stalky smelling on the nose, this young Tempranillo is jarring on the palate. Flavors of berry fruits come with oak and saltiness, while the finish is rubbery in feel and herbal in flavor.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",51328
"23465","On the lean side, this is a dry, tannic wine with more structure than flesh. It's firm, with a strong sense of wood aging followed by some acidity. It could soften in 3–4 years.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",23465
"20317","This is as basic as Albariño gets, with aromas of sweet apple and pear. It feels round and a bit soft, with fleshy peach and dry melon flavors. The finish is pithy, with a white pepper note and an indication that the wine is starting to fade. Drink immediately.","White","Albariño","Spain",20317
"54656","Jam and vanilla aromas and ripe raspberry flavors make this plenty fruity, while crisp acidity lends just a touch of grip to the silky texture. It's medium bodied and easy to drink.","Red","Zinfandel","US",54656
"102799","The aromas are light, with notes of moist earth, smoke, cassis, herb and berry. The saline and fruit flavors are silky in feel, bringing a sense of concentration and texture that keeps the interest high. There's plenty of minerality throughout along with a lengthy finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",102799
"57424","Year after year, IB bottles sunshine and fun in the form of this lightly sparkling, sweet pink wine. It's unabashedly exuberant, flashing floral aromas, then adding hints of Mexican chocolate, red berries and orange zest. There's just enough acid and fizz to keep it from being cloying on the palate.","White","Moscato","Australia",57424
"21902","Asphalt, licorice and espresso mark the nose of this medium-bodied, juicy Shiraz. The flavors are brighter, hinting at rhubarb, yet still retaining a dark, tarry edge. Drink this mouthwatering wine over the next few years.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",21902
"4102","Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes. It shows ample weight in the mouth, even a slightly oily texture and pronounced green flavors that persist a good long time. Probably best with fresh tomato or strongly herbal dishes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",4102
"55700","The second vintage of this Rainstorm rosé sports fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, with hints of fresh cracker in both the aroma and the finish. But it's the fresh fruit that's driving the flavor bus here, with some added length and detail as it winds down, perhaps due in part to the native yeast fermentation.","Rosé","Rosé","US",55700
"77656","A fine, everyday Merlot, soft and approachable, with ripe berry, cherry, cola and oak flavors. The tannins are pretty. Drink up.","Red","Merlot","US",77656
"12036","Surprisingly silky on the palate, this approachable but elegant Pinot Grigio is a great value. Its punchy tangerine and lemon flavors are crisp and widely appealing, but there's also a nuanced slick of minerality on the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.","White","Pinot Grigio","Germany",12036
"60480","Red cherries, dark spices of clove and anise and gingerbread show on the nose of this wine from the Foley family portfolio. Darkness pervades the concentrated palate, with black fruits, dark chocolate, beef char and condensed purple flowers. It's so deep that it lacks noticeable flavor layers.","Red","Merlot","US",60480
"93821","The inclusion of 11% Aligoté, which was sourced from a block planted in 1979, makes this Chardonnay unique. The Aligoté seems to thicken the core fruit, and it adds flesh and rind-like flavor, along with old-vine details of dried herb and spice. It's a pleasing mix of integrated stone-fruit, grain and citrus-peel notes.","White","Chardonnay","US",93821
"103384","What a delicious Pinot Noir. The cool, long vintage has given it wonderful lightness and acidity, yet also an intensity of fruit that makes it irresistible. Marked by flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, it's a wine to savor now, with Pinot-friendly foods such as lamb and steak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103384
"43868","Tangy in nature, this wine has heaps of ripe red fruit, cola, Moroccan spices and orange peel, with licorice root and tart cranberry woven into an elegant palate. There's power and ageability to this Marlborough Pinot, but it's also begging to be enjoyed with a tagine. Drink now–2024.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",43868
"42847","Pure, upfront flavors of lemon, lime and orange mark this unoaked Chardonnay. Zesty Central Coast acidity is present, brightening and cleansing the richness. With a dry finish, it's nice now with sushi, fruit salad or grilled chicken.","White","Chardonnay","US",42847
"32725","Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality. Still, for a 2001 reserva it doesn't amount to much.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",32725
"49712","Fresh tangerine skins scent this zesty dry Riesling. Restrained on the palate with flavors of pressed apple and pear, it's not a deeply concentrated wine but refreshing and brisk.","White","Riesling","US",49712
"96009","Lightly buttered popcorn aromas are cut by lime blossoms, sea salt and jasmine on this delicate while extremely fragrant nose. A laser-like acidity slices through the palate, where pan-seared apple flavors are lifted by lemon pith, mandarin orange skins and orange blossoms.","White","Chardonnay","US",96009
"61204","New leather, underbrush, menthol, dark spice and chopped dill aromas lead the way in this structured red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry jam and licorice flavors alongside taut, fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. It's youthfully austere and needs a few years to unwind. Drink 2022–2029.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",61204
"103080","This is smooth as silk—supple and soft, with pretty cherry fruit and highlights of cocoa powder and coffee grounds. It's a professionally built wine all the way, made for easy enjoyment, with satiny tannins and a touch of anise.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103080
"51744","Erath is on a single-vineyard crusade; the number of different bottlings is downright dizzying. This particular vineyard, just outside of the town of Dundee, produces a relatively soft wine, spicy with pine needles and herbs, and finishing with a distinctly metallic note that flattens out the flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51744
"58893","The oak peeks through, set against proportionate strawberry and cherry fruit which has been lightly ripened. It's not a big wine, but it is balanced, and was barrel-aged for 18 months in a percentage of French oak. It should drink well now through 2022.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58893
"66253","Made with organically grown Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of chamomile, acacia and exotic fruit. The soft, round palate offers ripe yellow apple, vanilla and a hint of baking spices alongside a subtle mousse.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",66253
"49038","Rich red cherry, rust, smoke and crushed gravel aromas show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Smoked meat, lavender and rose petal notes play with cranberry, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors, creating a pleasant mix of delicate and savory elements.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49038
"88487","While bright and fresh with fruit, this robust structured rosé offers enough substance to thrive beyond a summer season. Dry and sprightly, it offers crisp raspberry and cherry flavors nuanced by complexities of garrigue and earth. A pleasant bite of tannins elongates the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Germany",88487
"78078","This delicious Cabernet Franc shows good varietal character, although it does include 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives the cherry and red currant fruits a deeper note of blackberries. There are hints of wild herbs and black pepper that add to the complexity. What a lovely wine for drinking now, but first give it a good decanting of several hours.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",78078
"54043","Hailing from old plantings in the Rocks District, this brings unique sagebrush, violet, blackberry, smoked meat, black pepper and wet stone notes. The palate is exquisitely pure and fresh, with abundant, layered blackberry and kirsch flavors. With its peppery finish and plush mouthfeel, it's swoon-worthy.","Red","Syrah","US",54043
"35228","A rare white wine from Saint-Émilion vineyards, this is seriously wood-aged, showing mature toast and almond flavors, with a citrusy edge. It has weight and richness, gradually revealing peach and apricot notes while merely hinting at acidity.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",35228
"9421","Fresh and floral on the nose and palate, this has loads of white flower and Meyer lemon tones. Dry in style, it builds in intensity on the palate, with hints of honey, wax and saline-like minerality that linger on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",9421
"417","There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",417
"29996","Stone, smoke and mineral oil aromas juxtapose deeply concentrated flavors of peach, tangerine and quince on the palate of this deftly balanced Riesling. While dry in style, it's lusciously mouth-filling, suggesting swirls of honey and citrus. A long, steel-touched finish dries everything up nicely. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2022 and likely beyond.","White","Riesling","Germany",29996
"45978","Expertly light touches of banana, honey, pecan, tuberose and citrus peel show on the nose of this blend by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi. There is great energy and tension to the sip, with yellow-grapefruit-juice flavors. Crisp, this would be a great shellfish pairing.","White","White Blend","US",45978
"84043","Blended with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this is an austere, unfussy red made in modest quantities that has crisp red currant and cranberry flavors interwoven with cedar and dried herb.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",84043
"95701","A blend of 50% Friulano and 50% Chardonnay, this offers toasted oak, lemon zest, yellow apple and buttery sensations accompanied by zesty acidity. It has more oak-driven flavors than fruit richness and it ends on a note of bitter walnut.","White","White Blend","Italy",95701
"473","This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose. It's fun to sip, with snappy red fruits and hibiscus most prominent. Complexity comes from touches of rooibos tea and potpourri. It's still extremely youthful.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",473
"97515","Dry and softly tannic, this Cab is ready to drink now. It offers blackberry, black and red currant, licorice and sage flavors, with a touch of smoky new oak.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",97515
"1781","Crushed stones and river rocks take center stage in this elegant off-dry Riesling. It's gorgeously mineral, yet also anchored against a backdrop of crisp cutting yellow-peach, tangerine and lemon flavors. It's a zesty, invigorating wine with a clean but persistent finish.","White","Riesling","US",1781
"29166","After five years on the lees, this is a brassy-hued, toasty wine. Hints of honey and caramel creep in, along with buttered citrus and ample toastiness. It's medium bodied and silky in texture. Drink now.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","New Zealand",29166
"74681","Ceago's Reserve seems a little top-heavy in oak. The caramel and woodsap coating smothers the underlying wine, which is very fine, to judge by the winery's '07 unoaked Chard.","White","Chardonnay","US",74681
"52617","Plum cake, resin, leather, raisin and exotic spice aromas come together in the glass. On the dense palate, licorice, chopped sage and tobacco notes accent prune and blackberry while firm, fine-grained tannins offers support.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",52617
"43940","Mossy, lightly herbal aromas of blackberry and marzipan are attractive. This is rich, loud and racy in the mouth, with vanilla, tobacco, plum and berry flavors that finish long and ride elegantly on a beam of slightly sharp acidity. Drink this fine Carmenère through 2016.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",43940
"34507","This has medicinal herb and adhesive bandage aromas that carry over to the lean palate. Racy acidity and a bitter note give it a firm, brisk finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",34507
"6230","A pretty good Chardonnay. Its a little pineapple juicy, and the oak is pretty strong, but a streak of minerality and crisp, clean acidity give just enough structure.","White","Chardonnay","US",6230
"84757","A rich, lusty wine, dry and easy to like for its array of blackberry, cherry, anise and sandalwood flavors. Made from the traditional Bordeaux varieties, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it really pleases the palate. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",84757
"51707","The Estremoz region in Alentejo is at the heart of one of the major vineyard areas. This rich and now mature wine shows the ripe fruit and structure that can be produced there. It is packed with tarry black fruits and dusty tannins. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",51707
"35744","As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",35744
"19574","This wine is gorgeous, with flavors of hazelnut, pear and ripe green apple. It's crisp, balanced and perfectly sweetened. Mixed with vodka and fresh fruit juices, it also makes a fine cocktail.","White","Pinot Gris","US",19574
"31352","This label has had its ups and downs over the years. The 2010 Pinot Noir is one of the successes, and it boasts an effusive nose of roses, cherries, dusty earth and mocha. It's medium to full in the mouth, delivering cherry fruit and underpinnings of earth and spice. The finish is long, spicy and firm without being hard.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",31352
"98952","A very subdued expression of the normally flamboyant Gewürztraminer grape, the opening notes are of wool and mineral. The full-bodied palate has accents of candied orange rind and toast. Good for those who can't deny Gewürz's ability to flatter Asian food, but who prefer a more subtle wine.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",98952
"27133","An earthy funk and puckeringly dry tannins mark this wine, which remains dry on the palate from start to finish, characterized along the way in leather and black pepper.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",27133
"17543","Red and black licorice figure into the soul of this softly smooth and likable mountain wine. Classic in its approach, and relatively medium bodied, it's lithe and elegant in texture, with faint traces of cedar, graphite and crisp currant.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",17543
"19715","Its name a play on the Petit Chablis appellation (pas si petit means “not so little”), this wine has a ripe and fruity character. Crisp texture and lively, exuberant acidity carry its white fruit flavors into the finish. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",19715
"48778","Doesn't say so on the label, but it's Cabernet Sauvignon. However it's utterly unlike most other Napa Cabs in the dryness and tartness. Almost like a Chianti, with bone-dry cherry, red currant and tobacco flavors, scoured with tannins, that finish with a cut of acidity.","Red","Red Blend","US",48778
"95994","Plump mulberries and ripe black cherries meet with black sage and dark, clove-y herbs on the nose of this wine from Bentrock Vineyard. The rich, concentrated palate surrounds a dense raspberry core, proving quite lively thanks to the camphor and sage-like spice that carries deep into the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95994
"82467","While it is still young, the wine is showing great fruit and soft tannins. Juicy black cherries are ripe and full, a sign of the fine vintage. With the acidity and the dry core, the wine should age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",82467
"39043","Round, plump aromas are a bit vegetal, with a suggestion of canned beans and peas. The palate is balanced but full. Pithy flavors of green fruits finish lightly bitter, with notes of arugula, bell pepper and lime.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",39043
"4029","Firm, well-modulated and medium-bodied, this estate-grown wine brings a mix of apple flesh and skin, along with a strong scent of biscuit. and hint of vanilla. Overall it's staunchly varietal, though not especially complex.","White","Chardonnay","US",4029
"77267","An impeccable wine, this is so finely balanced between its rich fruits and structure. With its seamless character, it offers both fine acidity, green and white fruit and an undertow of wood aging. This is a wine for long-term aging.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",77267
"33973","Made of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Malvasia Bianca, this opens with red-skinned fruit and an earthy underbrush aromas. The fresh, straightforward palate evokes red cherry and chopped herb, framed by smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",33973
"82716","The flint soil of the vineyard shows in the steely, mineral character of this wine. It is all about structure at this stage, subduing the citrus fruits that are developing. It will fill out over the next few months, so drink from late 2016.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",82716
"15158","Eccentric, with sweet and sour tangerine, banana and buttered toast flavors. Crisp acidity provides balance, but the wine is nearing the end of its useful period.","White","Chardonnay","US",15158
"64738","Almost neutral aromas of cantaloupe and nectarine are dusty on the nose. This Carmenère-based dry rosé is citric, juicy and tight on the palate, with grapefruit and other citrus flavors adding life. Orange and citrus pith notes control the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Chile",64738
"91240","A beautifully ripe wine, with the new wood just a hint in the background. The wine has rich red plums and black cherries, laced with the most intense acidity. It is a dense, firmly concentrated wine with a long ahead.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",91240
"85968","Aromas of black cherry and dark chocolate prime the palate for flavors of black cherry, black plum, mocha, smoked meat and a hint of bell pepper. It is vibrant on entry, with a sense of brightness that stands out above firm but subtle tannins.","Red","Shiraz","Israel",85968
"70883","Scents of marshmallows and spun sugar are twined around flavors of lemon, candied orange peel and English Breakfast tea. It's off-dry, brisk and lively.","White","Riesling","US",70883
"33555","Oaky influences give this wine a candied taste of caramel and lime pie, on top of the grapier flavors of pineapples and pears. It's solidly in the mode of what Americans want in a Chardonnay.","White","Chardonnay","US",33555
"49295","Gold in color, with aromas of hay, melon and banana, this feels plump and round, with a fair amount of skins-based tannin. Nectarine and orange flavors finish full and snappy.","White","Albariño","Spain",49295
"59495","The palest color leads to a perfumed, very ready-to-drink wine. It is crisp with fruit that is now softened by a year's aging, offering a touch of caramel along with crushed strawberry flavors. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",59495
"58342","Meaty and substantial on the palate, this wine comes from several vineyard sites and was fermented in stainless steel tanks. It has a juicy note of sweet, ripe red fruit that's inviting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58342
"44731","The match of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon seems perfect. The wine's great ability is in offering soft, round cherry tones backed by more typical notes of forest berry and blue flower. Its texture is plush, and the vibrant midpalate closes with bright fruit.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",44731
"46772","Ripe notes of yellow pear are rounded with creamy notes of yeast. There are overtones of dried hayflowers and fresh, green spring meadows. The palate comes together around a vein of zesty, enlivening lime freshness and leaves a clean, mouthwatering finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",46772
"4840","This dark, ripe wine combines 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, 10% Zinfandel and 4% Petit Verdot. Together they form an alliance of black cherry, blackberry jam and clove, richly rounded and expressive.","Red","Red Blend","US",4840
"24061","This medium-bodied wine has a slightly dusty mouthfeel, which gives its palate just enough shape to highlight the flavors of dried dark-skinned fruit. It's a little pruney, but would probably work fine with stews or hard cheeses.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",24061
"66017","The sophistication of Luisa Ponzi's wines increases from vintage to vintage, especially at the high end. Here is a Chardonnay for butter lovers, but there is much more to enjoy than just lush barrel flavors. Thick and full bodied, it has notes of caramel apple, poached pear and passion fruit, sprinkled with baking spices. It's a flavor jamboree.","White","Chardonnay","US",66017
"77690","Yellow plum and mineral hints of wet pebble with an almost salty draw demand attention. The palate is fresh and full of appetizing, lemony zing and concentration. This is fun and satisfying, not to say completely delicious.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",77690
"4951","Moderate in oak and well-structured, this estate-grown wine is subdued and classy, with defined layers of green olive, juicy apple and lemongrass, a tiny hint of jalapeño adding a touch of spice. Food-friendly, it'll complement a versatile range of dishes.","White","Chardonnay","US",4951
"20095","A medium-bodied Chardonnay with a slight lactic note to it, the 2008 Martinborough Vineyard Chardonnay is crisp and long on the finish, highlighting its flavors of vanilla and pineapple. Might improve with another year or two in the bottle.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",20095
"70427","Gold in color, this wine offers a bouquet of pink grapefruit and juniper berry. There is a nice balance between fruit and savory flavors, with lemon-lime, rose petal and Mediterranean herbs at play on the palate. It is soft on the palate and features a fruit-filled finish.","White","Chardonnay","Israel",70427
"89663","This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",89663
"53454","Made in a rather ripe style, this bottling hits the nose with yellow-apple custard, banana chips, bubblegum and mango-candy flavors. The palate is also quite ripe and a tad sweet, with apple blossoms, tropical candy and apple-soda flavors.","White","Viognier","US",53454
"75089","Dusty spiced-apple aromas set up a stony, drawn-in palate with a mix of tart tangerine and pickled flavors. On the finish, this is fresh, almost sour in flavor, and light in weight.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",75089
"38261","A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",38261
"92018","Mild citrus and tropical aromas are pleasant. The mouthfeel on this Central Valley SB is pulpy and full, with only moderate acidity, while flavors of melon, papaya and cucumber finish quietly.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",92018
"58883","Making a vintage only from Chardonnay, the Gimmonet family is able to bring out the best of the year. This wine retains its crispness, minerality, almost chalky texture and fresh pear flavors. Its freshness promises aging potential.","White","Chardonnay","France",58883
"78444","Apple and pear aromas set up a lively, somewhat chunky feeling palate. Flavors of green citrus fruits and brine finish similarly, with briny notes sitting side by side with citrus flavors.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",78444
"97525","A little too soft for true balance, but with pleasant cherry, cola, vanilla and spice flavors. Finishes abruptly. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",97525
"26145","In an effort to further differentiate the Foreshadow Merlot from the Foreshadow Cabernet, winemaker John Bookwalter has kept each out of the other's blend. This is a riveting, complex, supersized wine, with alcohol over 15% and plenty of intriguing barrel flavors. The black cherry-berry fruit is swathed in spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee, complex and well-crafted.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",26145
"71177","Herbal and thin, this is not the fleshy, fruity style typical of Oregon Pinot Gris. Dilute flavors of apple and melon are smothered in herbs.","White","Pinot Gris","US",71177
"64775","This is a big, barrel-aged Chardonnay resplendent in caramel and honey, although it turns a bit bi-polar on the mid-palate, where it shows off lean minerality. A yin and yang wine, with a slight burn on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",64775
"69755","Soft fruit, with a tannic hint underneath. The wine is supported at this stage by wood, while the fruit has strawberry jam sweetness. The acidity and structure really only come through at the end.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",69755
"88383","This is a best of barrels blend from Hall's various vineyards, including the famous Sacrashe. The wine itself is lovely. It has a firm structure thanks to dusty tannins and a dry minerality, while bright acidity makes the cherry, blackberry, blueberry, cassis and dark chocolate fruit sing. Drink now and through 2014.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88383
"24876","Light fruit flavors combine watermelon and strawberry, accented with charred, astringent tannins. A tobacco flavor threads on through the finish, with a slightly chalky mouthfeel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",24876
"44337","This is a dry-style Riesling, though it still lends a ripe, fruity impression. Lemon, lime and grapefruit are shuffled into a winning hand, with ample details of cilantro, fennel and wet stone. It's a vibrant, refreshing wine that is immensely food friendly.","White","Riesling","Canada",44337
"76028","Bright and fresh wine, but with delicious depth of apricot and green plum flavors. It's full with outstanding richness, while the fruit flavors have a great lift. Part of Schloss Gobelsburg's Tradition series, in which wines are aged longer before release.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",76028
"37624","Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This rosé features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.","Rosé","Rosé","Australia",37624
"62169","Deliciously ripe and generous, this full-bodied Zin has plenty to like: ripe blackberry, black cherry and baking spice aromas. Deep flavors echo the fruit and layer it with hints of vanilla and nutmeg. While full-bodied and nicely thick in texture, it's not over the top and remains balanced by firm acidity and welcome tannins.","Red","Zinfandel","US",62169
"120","Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",120
"4492","A juicy, jammy blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Montepulciano and 8% Zinfandel sourced primarily from Contra Costa County that's packed with blue and blackberry fruit, tobacco and plum. Clean and bright with a chewy texture.","Red","Red Blend","US",4492
"46457","Aromas of matchstick, herb, vanilla and cinnamon are followed by a creamy-feeling palate that equally mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",46457
"48002","A dense, almost heavy wine, with smoky, licorice flavors that dominate the fruit. It is firm, big, solid, the sort of wine that demands attention with its concentration and powered structure. It may need time for aging, but already the power and weight are there.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",48002
"41028","This is tight, showing bitter red berries as well as firm tannins. It has an awkward rough animal character that underlies the crisp acidity. The finish is better, showing delicious red cherries and layered freshness. Glass stopper.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",41028
"80707","Thin and reedy, with cherry tea, cola and green herb, vegetal flavors. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80707
"4483","Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis. Long and solid on the finish; captures the essence of value-priced Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",4483
"27138","A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Petit Verdot and 10% Syrah, this simple red opens with aromas of fresh violets, red berries and a whiff of spice. The brisk palate offers black cherries, a note of white pepper and a hint of sage alongside tangy acidity and loose-knit tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",27138
"23765","Black tar hovers over blueberry and black cherry fruit. The palate reveals ripe, intensely aromatic blueberry notes and firm freshness. Tannins have a smooth grip. What could be more juicy or berry-tastic?","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",23765
"69205","Rose, violet, black raspberry, wild cherry and espresso aromas lead the nose. The juicy fruit palate is accented with notes of sweet cake spices and supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",69205
"72493","Pure notes of red fruits reach the nose: Morello cherry and mulberry harmonize beautifully. Their purity pervades a palate that has the lightest touch: there is something authentic, beautiful and unforced about this. There is a suggestion, too, of herb, moss or undergrowth. This unpretentious winemaking style lets this pure, glorious fruit speak for itself and brings with it a profound sense of honest depth, bountiful earth and full-fruited balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",72493
"91935","With aromas like sweet strawberries and red cherries, and flavors as ripe as the aromas, this medium- to full-bodied wine is tempting, smooth and polished. It tastes refined but still lets loose a lot of fruit power. The balance is on the soft side, with mild tannins and subdued acidity.","Red","Zinfandel","US",91935
"51299","Faint hints of red currant join the creamy notes on the nose. The palate falls in with more fresh berry fruit and paints a picture of utter charm. The mousse is creamy and fine, supporting those tender, lithe berry notes. This is one for a balmy summer night and someone you love.","Red","Pinot Noir","England",51299
"78236","Valpolicella Vigneto Sant'Urbano offers very bright, albeit, one-dimensional aromas of red cherry and blueberry. The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and the wine promises to pair with light meat or pasta.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",78236
"93651","Red cherry, a touch of cinnamon, purple flowers and baked vanilla cookies show on the nose of this wine. Black cherry and gingerbread spice consume the palate, which also offers a rocky minerality and a vanilla foam finish.","Red","Barbera","US",93651
"43754","A pure expression of Petit Verdot from sunny, southern Tuscany, Per Cecco features deeply etched aromas of chocolate, ripe cherry, espresso bean, leather, plum cake and savory spice. The tannins are firm and need a few more years to evolve and soften.","Red","Petit Verdot","Italy",43754
"20305","At the age of seven-plus years, this 100% Cabernet is at the peak of its drinkability. It's dry and medium-bodied, and the blackberry and cherry fruit is drying out and turning leathery, with high alcohol poking through.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",20305
"104057","This is clean and brisk in lemony acidity, and it offers concentrated, complex flavors of honeyed pineapples, limes, oranges and mangoes. It's dry and finessed.","White","Chardonnay","US",104057
"35080","Among the early releases of the 2011 single-vineyard Pinots from Torii Mor, the Olson seems to be the one that had the most difficulty achieving full ripeness. Scents and flavors are focused upon green tea, peppery herbs, even a suggestion of fiddlehead ferns. The fruit reaches rhubarb-level ripeness and remains there, but the balance and structure are first-rate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",35080
"63945","This Bordeaux blend is soft, fruity and a little sweet, with the flavor of a cherry and blackberry confection in a cinnamon and anise pastry crust. Drink soon.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",63945
"98351","From the Cerise and Ridley vineyards, this wine explores two sites within the Anderson Valley. In taste it offers intense sour cherry, a flavor that finds its balance mid-palate, blossoming into smooth, spicy, full-bodied, oak-kissed goodness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98351
"8455","Decadent and intense, this smells like breakfast toast that has been slathered with red currant jam, mango butter and apricot preserves, topped with a drizzle of honey. The mouthfeel is rich, round and unctuous, with a zing of acidity that keeps it from seeming cloying. Notes of brûléed sugar and spice decorate the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",8455
"66139","This is a big, muscular wine with great structure and lots of enticing spicy oak and fruit flavors. It's full bodied, firmly tannic and very appetizing.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66139
"88238","A little rusty in color and somewhat transparent, with raisin as the key aroma. There's not a lot going on in the mouth, but the wine is mellow and deep, with sweet flavors of molasses, berry syrup and baked black fruits. Rich and candied, but rather sweet and a touch dull for Priorat. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",88238
"30003","This opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of ripe red berry, violet, leather, dark spice and a balsamic note. The chewy palate doles out fleshy Marasca cherry, licorice clove and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside robust but smooth tannins. Drink from 2018 through 2023.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",30003
"38056","This is a good wine for enjoying now with Mexican food or a barbecue. It's dry and briary, with black pepper-accented cola, blackberry and, currant flavors.","Red","Zinfandel","US",38056
"7620","Its prime location near Archery Summit and Domaine Drouhin marks Nysa as one of Oregon's most sought-after fruit sources. Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery) has chosen it for one of two vineyard designates for this new project. Sweet baking spices and raspberry jam are the hallmarks here, offering immediate appeal, while retaining the structure to age for another decade. Aim for an optimal drinking window from 2019 through 2024.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7620
"12770","Yeasty roundness meets opulently ripe fruit: red-cheeked apple, yellow pear and juicy yellow peach. The spicy verve of grapefruit zest pulls it into focus. This interplay on fruit and freshness dominates the midpalate majestically and has a staying citrus-power.","White","Riesling","Austria",12770
"59679","One of a series of single parcel wines from the Chermette family estate, this is dark and rich. It has generous tannins alongside the dark cherry and plum fruit. The cru wine's structure and richness will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Gamay","France",59679
"90503","This opens with aromas of ripe berry, cake spice, leather and blue flower. The juicy medium-bodied palate offers black plum, wild cherry, coffee and star anise framed in chewy rounded tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",90503
"3855","Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese. It's dangerously quaffable, yet nuanced by shades of candlewax, mineral and saffron that extend the finish dramatically.","White","Riesling","Germany",3855
"71591","A 100% Petit Verdot is a rare event. Here in Bairrada, close to the ocean, the grape produces a structured, dense wine with serious blackberry fruits and dark tannins. It is deeply colored, ripe with bold fruitiness as well as acidity. Drink the wine now.","Red","Petit Verdot","Portugal",71591
"102248","This intense and determined Nebbiolo from the Martinenga cru of Barbaresco delivers enticing aromas of black fruit, smoke, tar, licorice and old spice. The wine is elegant and ethereal with a polished nature to its firm tannins capped by pleasantly piquant freshness on the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",102248
"47674","An excellent trio of vineyards—Minnick Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Alder Ridge—contribute to this substantial effort. The fruit is dense and lively, with spicy, tangy mixed berry, currant and cherry character. The tannins have been nicely polished, and the acids provide the underpinning that gives the wine its lift. Despite its power, the wine keeps the alcohol in check, without a trace of heat or burn.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47674
"86785","This Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah has plenty of cherry and mocha deliciousness. It seems a bit sweet on the finish, so drink it with compatible foods, like bacon.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",86785
"60288","One of the better deals for top-quality Pinot, Steve Dooley's entry-level bottling invites the nose with deep and dark black cherry, grape soda and even blueberry aromas, leveled by a hint of ethereal roasted game and dried sage. The purple note holds into the palate, which shows lavender and other potpourri elements.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60288
"33441","The fragrance of black cherries and violet lay the groundwork for flavors of cherry, Fuji apple, eucalyptus, violet and a touch of iodine. Although labeled medium-dry, this blend of two grapes native to Georgia—one red, one white—is truly on the dry side. It is very soft in the mouth, with a nice touch of menthol on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Georgia",33441
"32826","Aromas like butter, blanched almonds and honey lead to equally rich flavors and a soothing, fat texture for this indulgent wine. It has very good concentration that helps the fruit and nut nuances linger on the finish.","White","Roussanne","US",32826
"81614","Leesy apple aromas lead to a narrow, low-spritz palate. Briny, leesy flavors are salty and complex, not your typical apple-pear-and-fizz combination. A briny, low-fruit finish turns increasingly savory and like seashells the longer this sits. Drink now.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",81614
"46869","A youthful wine given 50% whole-cluster fermentation, this is complex and delicate, restrained in oak while being expressive in roses and bitter black tea. Soft, pungent black fruit provides a savory element that's entirely welcome and interesting, before a freshness takes hold on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46869
"76183","Fleshy red cherry fruit bursts from the glass. The palate has corralled the abundant fruit into an easy, fresh and appetizing package, with a medium body and smooth texture.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",76183
"67954","A little on the sweet side, with sugary green apple, orange and pineapple flavors. It's clean and crisp, making it a nice wine for summer picnics, at a good price.","White","Pinot Gris","US",67954
"104218","Milk chocolate, blueberry and black currant combine around a soft core of subdued tannins and classical weavings of cedar and dried herb in this mountain-grown wine. It finishes in puckering leather.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",104218
"14075","Firm tannins don't completely hide the bright red berry flavors of this full wine. Red cherries dominate, giving a broad feeling even while the tannic structure is still in charge. Good acidity at the end adds to the sense of aging potential. Drink from 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",14075
"105571","Stylish and fruity, this has red currant crispness and an attractive warm, ripe background. It's balanced and fresh, with intense fruitiness at the end.","Rosé","Rosé","France",105571
"102186","This demonstrates a good balance between minerality and ripe pineapple and apricot fruits. With a twist of lemon and an herb accent, it has both crispness and richness.","White","Chardonnay","France",102186
"34739","Ripe yellow and white fruits are the dominant factor in this smooth, rich wine. It has good weight, along with a juicy, lemon and zest texture. Not for aging, unlike some Pouilly Fumé, so drink over the next few months. Screwcap.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",34739
"53714","There's plenty to enjoy aromatically and texturally in this wine. It offers floral and citrus refreshment and intrigue around deeper, richer elements of melon and kiwi. Oak surrounds the big finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",53714
"26975","Kirsten's Feinherb, or gently sweet bottling, maintains a firm foundation of stoniness, but also embraces softer, less angular dimensions of spring blossom and peach. High-toned acidity brighten and lifts the palate through a long finish. Drink now through 2021.","White","Riesling","Germany",26975
"29907","From a 90-year-old vineyard, this begins with a lean blackberry nose and other pointed dark-red to deep-purple fruits, all nicely laced with minerality and herbs. The flavors are dynamic, slipping from cranberry to pomegranate to cherry juice. A black tea finish framed by strong tannins ensures long cellar life. Drink 2018–2022.","Red","Zinfandel","US",29907
"38960","This exciting blend of Oseleta and Merlot (the grapes are partially air dried for extra concentration) offers a bright cherry aroma, with notes of leather and dried rosemary. There's are touches of humus and dried ginger as well.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",38960
"104772","A decent introduction to Aussie Chardonnay, this new line from Penfolds boasts plenty of sweet vanilla and peach flavors in a full and somewhat syrupy package.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",104772
"53661","Sourced from all three estate vineyards, this offers the same fine structure and impeccable balance as the individual cuvées. Berry fruit flavors are firmly perched on a frame of iron, with polished tannins and a streak of fresh ground coffee running through the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53661
"61167","The nose on this Cava from Ribera del Duero is chunky and yeasty. In the mouth, the wine foams up while showing flavors of orange, lemon and minerals. It's a touch sour on the finish, but overall it smells and tastes good, with little to no complexity.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",61167
"56136","A light, bright and easygoing wine with clean notes of citrus, fresh-cut grass and lime zest. Lively acidity keeps the palate vibrant and refreshing, ending with a mouthwatering, tart green-plum flavor. Drink up.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",56136
"55770","There's a streak of green unripeness that gives a vegetal note, with some polished berry and cherry flavors, too. It's unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55770
"15759","Dry, lean and tight, this is a crisply mineral Sauvignon Blanc that manges to avoid any sense of grassiness or overly herbal notes, instead focusing on a narrow range of fruit flavors: green apple, lime and grapefruit. Fine as an apéritif or with light seafood dishes. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",15759
"51825","Thick and chewy, this is a concentrated Cabernet with a powdery coating to the palate that continues to pummel in intense red fruit. Rich and extremely fruit forward, it's not for the meek and may prove more tame with time.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",51825
"74194","This is deep and ruby in hue, while the aromas are spicy, brightly oaky and reminiscent of red cherries. Ripe yet fresh and tangy flavors recall cherries and raspberries, while a vein of darker plum comes in and lingers on the long finish. It's serious and delightful at the same time, and will age well; delicious now, but best after 2016.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",74194
"62779","This is a soft, lightly fruity wine with citrus and grapefruit flavors. It has some minerality and an attractive texture that gives shape to the wine. Drunk fresh in the summer, it will make a fine apéritif.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",62779
"78725","A slightly prickly nose that offers hints of green herbs and cactus sets up the citrusy palate, brimming with grapefruit, orange and green-herb flavors. The finish is shear and citrusy, with cleansing acidity.","White","Verdejo","Spain",78725
"71050","Closed aromatically, this tannic Cab doesn't impart much in the way of fruit, offering leather and herbs instead.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71050
"10917","Zingy and restrained Sauvignon Blanc, none of those tropical top notes but greenish concentration on the palate. The slender palate shows tingling freshness and verve reminiscent of grapefruit zest. Very refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",10917
"77960","Taittinger's prestige cuvée epitomizes the Chardonnay predilection of this producer. This now-mature bottling is elegant and very stylish. Toast and a soft texture combine with great complexity to reveal a wine that is poised and ready to drink. But with the acidity in the background, it could still age, so drink now and until 2022.","White","Chardonnay","France",77960
"14975","Round and fruity in character, this has initial freshness and ripe yellow-fruit flavors. On the finish, there is a tang of orange zest.","White","Chardonnay","France",14975
"35590","A cool swathe of pine needles juxtapose ripe peach and waxy floral notes on this fragrant, delightfully layered Riesling. While dry and dainty on the palate, it's chock full of ripe, rich peach and mango flavors. The finish is endlessly long, fringed by a line of dusty minerals. It's refreshingly quaffable but substantial from nose to finish.","White","Riesling","US",35590
"33695","This has fragrances of ripe black cherry, raisin and a touch of leather. The palate delivers raisin and raspberry flavors, along with spicy black pepper notes. The palate is a bit evolved, showing tertiary notes.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",33695
"92020","Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",92020
"20512","There's a subtle honeyed edge to this otherwise light and easygoing wine, adding heft to the ripe melon and stone fruit notes. The lush fruit flavors pair with the mouthwatering acidity on the finish, balancing everything out in the end. Drink now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",20512
"14754","Dry, hard in tannins and rustic in the way of some youthful Petite Sirahs. If you drink it now, you'll find plenty of sweet, flashy cherries and raspberries, but the wine will feel hard and astringent. Needs time. Should begin to blossom after 2014 and drink well for many years after.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",14754
"12441","Made in the popular Chardonnay style, this shows buttered toast, buttercream, pineapple, mango and exotic spice flavors. Drink this rich wine now.","White","Chardonnay","US",12441
"72054","Hints of fennel add a splash of green to the intense yellow peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors of this penetrating, off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with sweet fruit flavors, but spirited lemon-lime acidity carries it to a dry, elegantly floral finish.","White","Riesling","US",72054
"56017","Vanilla and pear aromas begin this soft-bodied wine that is mouthfilling and easy, but not up to shocking anyone. The flavors of orange and pineapple are close to the real thing, and the finish is smooth and easy. A mellow white wine at its best.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",56017
"56277","Somewhat aloof now, this has grippy tannins that lock down the palate. Underneath the grip are complex flavors of juicy blackberry, plum sauce and exotic spice, with brooding earthy notes and sweet, smoky oak tones. Very fine, but one for the cellar. Give it at least 6–8 years, and it could easily go for another decade beyond that, gradually becoming more delicate, supple and complex.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56277
"18469","Lighter than Malibu Oak's Cabernet Sauvignon, this Cab Franc shows the variety's characteristic herby notes and is otherwise easy and light, with enough depth to pair well with a range of meats.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",18469
"87827","Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",87827
"37082","Longtime value producer Firesteed has another winner. This pretty Pinot shows excellent ripeness and full-bodied fruit flavor, thanks to the southern-Oregon components. Strawberries and tart raspberries come through cleanly, with a touch of cola in the aftertaste.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37082
"24864","This perfumed, juicy wine is bright with red berries and acidity, while a core of firmer tannins gives structure. Even with this, the wine is forward, ready to drink with its long-drawn fruitiness and acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",24864
"32679","Fruity, oaky and simple, with tangerine, vanilla, buttered popcorn and smoky flavors. Drink now.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",32679
"92414","Yeasty wine, with mature toast flavors, showing bitter almonds and old acidity. The wine tastes really mature, about to be too old.","Sparkling","Portuguese Sparkling","Portugal",92414
"25112","Ripe in blackberries and cherries, this affordable Cabernet has an edge of toasty oak. It's an easy wine to drink now, at a good price.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",25112
"51891","Pale blush to the eye with a soft bouquet of apple and peach, this wine has flavors of grapefruit, aniseed and menthol with sophisticated savory undertones. The rounded finish offers just the right touch of brightness.","Rosé","Rosé","Turkey",51891
"10486","Extremely ripe and fragrant aromas of strawberry preserves smell quite quaffable on this decently priced wine. Flavors of raspberry, anise, rhubarb and clove-like spice are nicely rounded and finish up with smoky bacon fat elements.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",10486
"105300","Sawdust scents dominate the nose while butter, underlined by candied orange peel and clove, take over in the mouth. Medium finish shows some funky notes.","White","Chardonnay","US",105300
"32667","Fresh and clean for the most part, with light raspberry and strawberry aromas. It's a little cloying on the palate, but the flavors of citrus and melon, while briney, are lasting and move in the right direction. A good buy made from the obscure Bobal variety and Tempranillo.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",32667
"84691","Made entirely with Merlot, this has a shy nose that tries to hide suggestions of plum and bell pepper. The straightforward palate provides plum with hints of vanilla and clove alongside grainy tannins.","Red","Merlot","Italy",84691
"96327","Emidio Pepe shows excellent results with the 2001 vintage of his landmark Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. Made according to rigorous organic principles, the wine shows dark fruit and blackberry with bold leather and tobacco at the back. The tannins are polished and tight but the wine still shows more years of aging potential ahead.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",96327
"40744","Classic Calistoga red wine, totally dry, full-bodied and big. Assaults with sweet, ripe sour cherry candy, cola, anise and spice flavors that finish long and lush. Yet it shows a refined tannic structure, and there's a firm minerality. Could surprise in the cellar after six years, but no guarantees.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",40744
"46101","Crisp and slender, this offers drying tannins and aromas of fresh berry and white cherry. It shows a subdued and elegant personality overall.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",46101
"57414","A rosé with a difference: this is rich in texture and body as if it were barrel aged. It has a light peach color, plus delicate strawberry and peach aromas. A creamy mouthfeel carries the fruit flavors and adds hints of vanilla and baking spices.","Rosé","Rosé","US",57414
"11326","This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",11326
"63678","A lovely expression of Rheingau's exquisite minerality, this dry Riesling pulsates tones of steel and stone. Green apple and fresh herb flavors are highlighted by racy streaks of lime and lemon. It's slight in frame, but finishes with precision and power.","White","Riesling","Germany",63678
"85450","This is a sugary-sweet Sauvignon Blanc, with the flavor of a pineapple, pear and orange fruit drink. It's a little on the soft side, which accentuates the sweetness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",85450
"17252","This is on the soft side for rosés, a warm wine with a sense of Mediterranean herbs and sun. It has light red fruits, spice and great final acidity.  Screwcap.","Rosé","Rosé","France",17252
"63048","Vigna Broglio is a ripe, jammy Barolo with bold notes of mature cherry and blackberry preserves. It tastes more like a Tuscan wine than one from the Langhe and offers syrupy fruit flavors that indicate a hot vintage or a low altitude vineyard. It's soft in the mouth, however, and offers very smooth tannins. Drink 2012–2015.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",63048
"83611","Lots of rich, ripe raspberry and cherry jam fruit in this dry, briskly acidic Pinot Noir. Oak shows up in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. It's a little irregular in tannins, but delicious for drinking now, after decanting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83611
"60073","Light wood aging sets the scene for this crisp and herbaceous wine. Citrus fruits give a juicy character and contrast with the mineral texture coming from the stony vineyard. It's a fresh wine to drink now.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",60073
"57104","Brisk lemon and apple notes are delicate and unassuming on the nose, making the blossomy, peachy palate on this Chardonnay a pleasant surprise. Despite its bold alcohol, zesty acidity lends freshness and the finish is invigoratingly mineral.","White","Chardonnay","US",57104
"39003","Slight spritz enhances the green, crunchy apples of this fresh, friendly blend of Neubuger and Grüner Veltliner. Grüner's earthiness and Neuburger's nuttiness shine through but the overall tone is one of lightness and joy.","White","White Blend","Austria",39003
"51593","A sturdy Pinot, this has an appetizing texture because of the moderate tannins and acidity, with modest fruit and herbal flavors. It will be a good pairing with rich, meaty dishes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51593
"64179","Dry, spicy red-fruit aromas are solid and standard, while the palate is lean but comfortable, with dry, simple cherry flavors accented by a spot of oak-driven vanilla. Good but as regular as they come. Easy to drink.","Red","Merlot","Argentina",64179
"50914","From an estate just to the west of Saint-Estèphe, this wine is structured and firm. A dry core of solid tannins balances the black-currant fruitiness. The wine is firm now although it will develop quickly, so drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",50914
"69657","Didn't much like the 2005 basic Tempranillo from Vall Sanzo and this twice-as-expensive Ribera Del Duero isn't much better. It starts out heavily gaseous, with aromas of wet clay and roasted fruit. The flavors are herbal and on the fringe of being sour, and there isn't much deftness to the wine.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",69657
"55720","Named after the Tyto Alba, the barn owl that lives in the forests around the vineyard, the wine shows a tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc. Mango and pineapple dominate the ripe character of the wine. It is aromatic, just hinting at something more herbal. Drink from 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Portugal",55720
"89473","A heavily wood-aged wine, this wine has smoky, burnt-toast aromas. At the moment, ripe yellow-fruit flavors are submerged beneath this onslaught of wood, but it should integrate better, so give it until 2016.","White","Chardonnay","France",89473
"97023","Vanilla soda, pineapple and a touch of herbaceousness hit the nose first in this Chardonnay, which is grown high in the Santa Lucia range by a family that's ranched the land since the 1850s. On the palate, some creaminess emerges alongside flavors of tart green apple and toffee nuts. Serve with lemon-herb chicken or well-seasoned fish dishes.","White","Chardonnay","US",97023
"97621","Earthy game, scorched earth and black-skinned fruit aromas come together in this Brunello. The palate is dense and ripe, delivering raspberry jam, mochaand vanilla flavors, with mature tannins. Enjoy 2018–2022.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",97621
"43033","Oaky, slightly odd aromas of clove and baking spices show more black fruit the longer this breathes. Tannic, drawing and hard across the palate, this tastes of savory, saucy plum and blackberry. On the finish, rubbery tannins and flavors of baking spices and tomato sauce take control.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",43033
"40430","This wine is tight and closed at this stage, although it has great potential. The fruit is lively and crisp, just waiting to burst out with citrus and sliced apple fruitiness. Wait until late 2017.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",40430
"9387","This full, ripe, balanced Priorat is a touch oaky and creamy up front, with schisty berry scents resting below the surface. Medium but nice on the palate, this offers cherry, currant, plum, coconut and marzipan flavors prior to an oaky, rooty tasting finish with ripe berry flavors. Drink now through 2021.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",9387
"5489","Smoky in dark clove and black pepper, this is a smooth, bright Zinfandel from head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in the 19th century. After skipping the 2011 vintage, the winery returns with this stunner, brambly in succulent blackberry with plenty of intriguing spice.","Red","Zinfandel","US",5489
"53089","Citrus and pear notes lead the way in this bargain-priced Chardonnay from Down Under. It's reasonably tight and crisp for a wine in this bracket, carrying hints of well integrated vanilla through the lemony finish. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",53089
"97436","This big, bold blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot is powerfully built, with firm, integrated tannins that feel chalky and dusty. Black currant and cherry flavors dominate, with waves of tobacco and dark chocolate leading to a soft, lingering finish. This will cellar well, to be enjoyed 2023–2028.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",97436
"33879","For this sweet and jammy wine, the fruit is sourced from what is reputed to be the second-oldest planting of Syrah in Washington State. Hints of lilac lead into concentrated flavors of blueberry and boysenberry, along with lush barrel accents of mocha and chocolate. Tannins are smooth and silky, and the wine has the grip and substance to cellar well through at least 2024.","Red","Syrah","US",33879
"73763","This has a spicy bouquet of black pepper, nutmeg and plum punctuated by sandalwood notes. The palate is subdued, revealing bitter cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors. The finish is short, with drying tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",73763
"66272","Violets and rose petals lead the nose, followed by ripe blackberries and, with a bit of patience, some warm pie crust. The flavors are pleasant but hard to pin down, with flashes of licorice, red currant, allspice and orange peel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66272
"55888","Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind.","Red","Syrah","US",55888
"52621","A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cab Franc, 17% Merlot and 7% Petit Verdot, the seventh edition of Mark Ryan's iconic Dead Horse is, as expected, a tannic, liquorous, sweet and ripe wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, plenty of barrel toast and chocolaty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",52621
"25768","Distinctly sugary, which gives the blackberries and cherries a jammy sweetness. But it's clean and crisp. For those who like this style, it's pretty good.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",25768
"1782","Peach and blossom notes abound on this delightfully fresh fruity wine. Its sunny stone-fruit flavors are concentrated and juicy, balanced against zesty lime acidity and a meandering pollen finish. Sprightly in texture yet buoyant.","White","Riesling","US",1782
"100113","This wine was crafted by Napa veterans Bill and Dawnine Dyer, from grapes grown on the estate Coombsville vineyard. It defines the modern style of ripe, soft, luscious Napa Cabernet, yet brings a firm structure that suggests the cellar. Give it 6–8 years, and it could still be going strong at the age of twenty. A mere 75 cases were produced.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",100113
"77772","This fine offering from Victoria's Mornington Peninsula nails Pinot Noir's elusive texture, gliding across the palate in a silky veil. Cherry-berry fruit is framed by hints of brown sugar, coffee and vanilla, but the oak should integrate with a few more months' aging.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",77772
"104703","Made with 75% Corvina and 25% Corvinone grapes—organically grown and dried for 90 days—this opens with aromas of raisins, ripe plum and black pepper. The robust palate offers black currant, licorice, nutmeg and tobacco alongside close-grained tannins. Drink through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",104703
"43177","This bone-dry wine offers flavors of white fruits. Its crisp acidity is tempered by a touch of honey and spicy almonds. Balanced and fruity, the wine is ready to drink.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",43177
"57789","As in many 2009s from the Northern Rhône, the Syrah fruit is superripe. Add in aging in 100% new oak barrels and the result is a big, richly tannic wine redolent of vanilla, cedar and blackberries. Drink now–2025.","Red","Syrah","France",57789
"7466","Floral red-fruit aromas show a touch of wild animal. The tight and choppy palate holds racy flavors of cherry and plum. A long, fruity finish rolls out little by little, with a lasting feel of grape skins.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",7466
"83679","Rustic, with a spin of smoke, this red has a nose of green herbs, black cherry and smoke, and flavors of dried herb, red berry and tobacco. Masculine and focused, it's perfect for spicy meat dishes and stews.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",83679
"54967","Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",54967
"55509","This is dry, scratchy and peppery smelling, with a soft, plump mouthfeel, plus leafy, herbal flavors of baked berry and plum. Plump and solid in terms of feel, with modest fruit and carob flavors that control the short finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",55509
"84486","This tightly wound wine opens in the glass, with intense, bright acidity that wraps around herbal, minty undertones. Blackberry, raspberry and clove give it plenty of varietal classicism, but it's the strong earthy loam and forest floor that provide intrigue and elegance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84486
"69324","Floral aromas and tight raspberry fruit flavors are the first impression. Next come notes of wild game, with blood, herb and a bit of liver pâté. Unique, deep and yet somehow delicate, this has impressive complexity for a vineyard's first release.","Red","Syrah","US",69324
"202","Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",202
"51195","This might be the most consistent Cabernet Franc you'll find. Each of the last four vintages has scored an even 90. This rendition starts with oaky, earthy aromas of plum and charcoal. This is compact and tannic on the palate, with minty blackened chocolaty berry flavors that finish with potency. Drink through 2019.","Red","Cabernet Franc","Argentina",51195
"102361","Stalky, sulfuric and oaky on the nose, then plump on the palate, this rosé from Valdeorras is made from Mencía, not one of Spain's normal rosé grapes. This tastes woody and like sawdust, with generic red-fruit flavors, sugary sweetness and vanilla on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",102361
"13906","New wood aromas give minty character to this wine. The palate is dominated by that wood, which covers the fruit and just leaves structure. Considering that the wine is now five years old, this imbalance will probably remain.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",13906
"44555","This is a taut wine, touched by yeast and warmed by ripe yellow fruit. Flavors of melon and spice from the new wood give it an open feel. It's ripe, already rounded and full bodied.","White","Chardonnay","France",44555
"105947","Fresh notes of juicy orange are the chief charm of this dry, fresh wine. The palate has an earthy aspect but comes with lip-smacking freshness. The finish is clean and dry.","White","Riesling","France",105947
"2828","This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly.","Red","Syrah","US",2828
"33483","Aromas of mesquite, smoke, strawberry, freesia and herbs are followed by quite light fruit flavors. The concentration seems wanting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33483
"70406","Syrah and Cabernet are at the heart of this blend, which is perfumed and bold, with olive, crushed earth and minerally aromas. Subtle on the palate, with dense but narrow plum and herb flavors. Finishes herbal, with good clarity, earth and character. Just shy of excellent.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",70406
"76784","There's wet river-stone freshness to this bright white wine by Rick Longoria, which also shows grapefruit blossoms, lemon balm and a touch of grassiness on the nose. There's verve on the sip, with lemongrass, kiwi and lime-skin flavors making for a very tight and green-leaning palate.","White","Albariño","US",76784
"7950","In this plush pillow of a wine, smoothness and easy drinkability come along with medium body, soft tannins, not too much crispness and just-ripe-enough flavors.","Red","Merlot","US",7950
"71683","Intense in black, brooding blueberry and cinnamon spice, this wine is robustly varietal if not a bit overdone, dense and syrupy with challenged acidity.","Red","Zinfandel","US",71683
"48818","Lots of rich, oaky blackberry, cherry and currant flavors in this dry, appealing Syrah. There's a roasted meat and black-pepper note that adds appeal, but also a green streak of unripe fruit. Drink up.","Red","Syrah","US",48818
"104439","This wine, from the producer's estate vineyard on Atlas Peak, relies on the addition of nearly 15% Petit Verdot, which provides additional prettiness and power. Well structured and in balance, it imparts cedar, dried herb and pencil shavings, as firm tannins and subtle oak play background roles. It's defined by cool-climate restraint and grace. Drink from 2022–2027.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",104439
"62385","This is an earthy Pinot Noir with prominent mushroom notes. It's crisp and dry, with some unripe flavors that compromise the otherwise ripe, red fruit. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",62385
"29772","Softly lush, a nice, fruit-forward Cabernet to drink now. Shows well-ripened blackberry and black currant flavors, finished with a touch of smoky oak. Good price for a Stags Leap Cab.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",29772
"32279","Ripe plum, dark coffee and spice flavors join the firm tannins in this intense wine. It has a strong structure that needs to soften to allow the juicy black-currant flavor to surface. Give it 4–5 years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",32279
"21340","Rich in body but light in tannins, this warm, generous wine fills the mouth and eases down the throat. It has a good mélange of cherry, strawberry and floral aromas, satisfying fruit flavors and a nicely soft finish.","Red","Grenache","US",21340
"104846","It discloses a refined version of the variety's classic aromas of white roses, lychee and grapefruit, which all carry over to the palate. The juicy fruit is accented with light notes of black pepper, candied ginger and clove that add depth.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",104846
"94618","From one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this shows prominent toast, vanilla, coffee and marionberry aromas. The palate is considerably more restrained, bringing a sense of lightness. Alone, each delivers, but the two seem out of sync.","Red","Syrah","US",94618
"86437","Smoky and big on the nose, with crusty black-fruit flavors backing that up. The wine is less deep and more hard and scratchy than some Mendoza Malbecs, but it's solid and sure-footed even if the mouthfeel is stark. Probably better with food than others due to its leaner, less opulent style.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",86437
"85740","Slightly funky aromas of dried, composting red and purple roses meet with crushed mint, vanilla and red berries on the nose of this complex bottling. Pomegranate, red plum and strawberry fruit show on the palate, bolstered by wet gravel, thyme and black-pepper spice.","Red","Grenache","US",85740
"63755","Flowery and easygoing on the bouquet, this is taught, lemony and wiry on the palate. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and apple feature cleansing acids and a persistent, citrusy tang. A blend of 80% Xarel-lo and 20% Riesling.","White","White Blend","Spain",63755
"74293","Classic varietal aromas like forest floor, black cherry and spicy, ripe red-fruit flavors offer welcome into this medium-bodied, firm-textured wine. The structure is so firm with acidity and tannins that it keeps the flavors slightly in reserve, so it will benefit from a few more years in the bottle. It will be best after 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",74293
"87469","Hard and mossy, and not bearing much resemblance to Cabernet as we know it. This wine has thickness and a creamy definition, but also lean fruit flavors that hint at raspberry and cranberry.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",87469
"103933","This fresh, crisp wine has plenty of lively citrus fruits that are enriched by red apple and zesty orange flavors. The wine is already delicious in its fruitiness and ready to drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",103933
"13615","Muddled notes of ripe berry on the nose come into sharper view on the citrus-focused palate. There is a vestige of tannin and pleasant dryness. Drink soon.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",13615
"56901","From a tiny, organically farmed vineyard outside of Occidental, this wine is dense in earth, with a brambly nose of wild cherry and cranberry. Salty and herbal, it retains plenty of acidity on the light-bodied palate, offering a mix of cinnamon and tangerine on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56901
"55022","Aroams of high-toned cherry and berry lead the nose of this wine, with secondary scents of tar, balsamic and leathery spice. Medium weight and smooth in body, the satiny tannins provide a subtle, accessible structure, framed by juicy  black-cherry and -raspberry flavors. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","France",55022
"54568","The nose isn't very expressive but eventually suggests aromas of toast, espresso and chopped herb. The tight palate offers oak, baking spice and the heat of alcohol but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins grip the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",54568
"10628","Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",10628
"29843","This is a new wine from Agustin Huneeus, of Quintessa. It's made largely from grapes off the Rutherford estate, and contains one-quarter Sémillon. Oak does not play a significant role, although the lees do. The wine itself is absolutely dry, crisp and minerally. It has palate-stimulating citrus flavors and is extraordinarily refined. Its only peer in Napa Valley is Mondavi's Tokalon Fumé Blanc.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",29843
"65345","To tame Durell is no easy feat—indeed at first this wine exudes matchstick and robustness on the nose and palate. But tameness comes in the form of lemon and grapefruit pith, brightening the load, with a sinewy structure supporting its core. The finish is succulent in honey and stone. Drink now through 2020.","White","Chardonnay","US",65345
"72082","Berry and raisin aromas announce a slightly overripe wine. That's confirmed on the palate, which feels a bit syrupy. Oaky black-fruit flavors are candied, and this Garnacha finishes steady but chunky.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",72082
"60985","The 147-acre vineyard on a high chalk plateau in the east of Cahors was first planted in the Middle Ages. It has produced a structured, mineral wine, very textured and with firm, dusty tannins. Underneath the black currant fruits are developing and will give a fine juicy wine from 2019. Grands Vins de Seigneur is a group of growers who approve each other's wines.","Red","Malbec","France",60985
"82343","This opens with aromas of orchard fruit, citrus and toasted bread crust. The firm palate offers lime, vanilla, oak and yellow apple skin alongside bracing acidity. A note of bitter almond marks the finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",82343
"3257","This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.","Red","G-S-M","US",3257
"41108","This blend of Sauvignon Blanc (65%) and Sémillon comes from Sagemoor, Boushey and Klipsun vineyards. It starts out barrel-forward with aromas of char and toast followed by citrus oil, spice and herbs. The concentration of the tropical fruit flavors is light and elegant but shows pleasing nuances and a good sense of balance.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","US",41108
"18064","This blends 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot into a tightly woven package of red fruit, soft tannin and robust concentration. Full bodied, it shows the warmth and distinct power of the vintage.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",18064
"64964","Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc each make up 50% of this blend. The aromas are forward, with notes of matchstick, smoke, herb, char and game. The flavors are lighter in style, with game and herb influences throughout that distract.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",64964
"54712","The wine is fruity with a stalky edge and bright black-currant fruit flavors. It is soft in character, fruity rather than structured, yet its acidity finishes the wine with a fresh lift.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",54712
"70128","Good acidity in this Gewürz, with spice, orange and wildflower flavors that finish clean and off-dry. With moderate alcohol, it's easy to drink now.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",70128
"11294","Sweaty, raw, sour aromas are harsh. The palate is flat and chunky in feel, with pithy grapefruit, nettle and bitter green flavors. Pyrazines and bitterness ride roughshod on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",11294
"6516","Made from a selection of premium parcels, this wood-aged wine still shows evidence of its toast and firm extract. So although there is plenty of fruit there, it's the dry core that is evident. It could still soften, so wait until 2017 to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",6516
"42838","Great for easy seafood or pasta dishes, this is fresh, with crisp acidity backed by notes of stone fruit, melon and yellow rose.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",42838
"83925","This aromatic wine suggests green apple, tangerine and flowers. It drinks dry with stone fruit and citrus flavors that have a fleshy feel.","White","Riesling","US",83925
"101237","Made with Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this opens with scents underbrush, scorched earth, cedar and baked plum. The palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and a confectionary note supported by assertive, fine-grained tannins. A grilled herb note signals the close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",101237
"65405","A 100% Sauvignon Blanc that was fermented in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine offers floral, nutty and deeply layered suggestions of structured oak. Medium to full-bodied, it's lengthy and impressive, with crispness to the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",65405
"93024","Wood spice aromas are an indication this wine that has had serious oak aging. Along with the dense tannins and wood, there is, happily, some fruit that will develop as the structure softens. Drink this powerful wine with its rich berry fruit from 2021.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",93024
"58856","Solid, fragrant and as you'd expect, but also high-acid and nervy. Otherwise, this is a perfectly good quaffing Rioja; it's sort of sharp but food-friendly, with tangy cherry and raspberry flavors. Not sour but angular on the palate.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",58856
"40630","High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards. The crispness lends a vibrant tension to the intense flavors of Meyer lemons, orange blossom and minerals, while oak adds softer, spicy notes. Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.","White","Chardonnay","US",40630
"22860","This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc lacks the depth and concetration of top examples, but remains a tasy glass of crushed tomato leaf and white grapefruit. Gentle greens and modest citrus flavors end clean and refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",22860
"82808","This ticks all the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc boxes: cut grass, snow pea, nectarine and citrus, all bundled into a medium-bodied wine that comes across as dry, silky and refreshing.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",82808
"43317","This single vineyard cuvée has a lovely purity of expression. It's Fred Astaire in a bottle, with sculpted smooth apple fruit that glides across the palate. Dotted with light hints of baking spices, it finishes with a lush lingering pat of butter.","White","Chardonnay","US",43317
"78502","Rosy cherry and plum aromas turn more rubbery and raisiny as this airs out. Solid, lifted and deep on the palate, this varietal Garnacha deals lightly herbal, floral flavors of plum and cherry cough drop, while the finish is oaky, resiny, raw, scouring and tough. Nothing about this is subtle or elegant, but it is dynamic. Drink through 2020.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",78502
"27701","A blend of nearly two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it brings notes of herbs, vanilla extract, cherry and chocolate. The wood plays a big part in the show, at times getting out in front of the fruit.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",27701
"7645","With a dull nose not making any promises, this wine turns out to be a velvety, full-bodied explosion of packed dark-cherry flavor and cola-vanilla, with moderate acidity and structure.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7645
"88623","A perfumed, fruity wine, Lange Ried, or “Long Vineyard,” is a textured and lightly minerally Riesling, with a concentrated white-fruit flavor and a crisp finish.","White","Riesling","Austria",88623
"30929","Racy, this stainless-steel fermented white is fuzzy in gooseberry and pineapple, not quite veering into fresh-cut grass, but staying more tropical and generous in ripe fruit. A dry, lemony finish provides refreshment.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",30929
"95287","Looking more like a light red wine than a supposedly pink one, this smells like ripe cherries and boysenberries, has a luscious, smooth texture and a soft, almost sweet finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",95287
"80593","Potent up front, this deals juniper and olive aromas in spades. In the mouth, it shows good body and depth. Herbal berry and olive flavors are a touch green, which is standard for the variety, while vanilla and carob flavors on the finish are derived from heavy oak.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",80593
"99018","Gritty aromas of black olive and road tar rest heavily atop herbal berry scents. This mystery blend is tight and tannic as nails. Blackened flavors of gritty blackberry, clove and wood spice finish rough and scratchy.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",99018
"78482","The best Hogue Chardonnay in years, this 2007 reserve bottling showcases fully ripened apple, peach and melon fruit flavors in a luscious wrapping of new oak. Butterscotch and a whisp of vanilla carry through the seductive finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",78482
"75269","The wine has 12 months of aging to give it extra richness and a ripe full texture. It does have firm tannins although these are already embedded in the rich black fruits. The Douro minerality shows through the texture and acidity at the end. This wine deserves some aging: drink from 2019.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",75269
"97862","Earthy pollen and dusty mineral notes extend from nose to finish on this slightly rustic Gewürztraminer, casting a shadow to more classic tones of lychee, rose petal and grapefruit. Its delicate body and balanced alcohol lend a refreshing quaffability.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",97862
"7000","Light and only gently structured, this is a cru wine that is more about juicy red fruits. It has attractive acidity and a touch of spice. It is likely to be ready to drink in the next few months, certainly by mid-2017.","Red","Gamay","France",7000
"75217","Aromatically unctuous and inviting, this rich, thick Petit Verdot, one of Concannon's smaller bottlings, is mouthfilling in chocolate, tobacco and dark plum, long-lasting through the midpalate and finish. Soft, with moderate tannins, it's a big wine with structure that'll age or pair with serious meat or game now.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",75217
"27456","While it is rich, the wine is more dominated by the minerality and structure of Chablis. White fruits, melon and pear come through, with a citric edge and firm toast. It is taut and tense, ready to age.","White","Chardonnay","France",27456
"69985","This is really a lovely Zin, showcasing how perfectly Dry Creek's terroir works for the variety. Although the alcohol level is high, the wine is elegant and balanced, with polished flavors of wild berries, cocoa, smoky wood and spices.","Red","Zinfandel","US",69985
"95410","An unusual blend of Syrah, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre, this tasty wine keeps its focus, offering up a palate-pleasing mix of plum and blueberry. There's a dash of pepper and pleasantly earthy tannins. All in all, this is a fine, out-of-the-ordinary pizza and burger wine.","Red","Red Blend","US",95410
"66624","This is a very pleasurable, smooth and rich Riserva that lavishes layers of chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and bright cherry. Overall, it shows good intensity and smooth consistency.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",66624
"98248","This very underripe expression of Pinot Noir will win hardcore fans of that style. Tart raspberry meets with green peppercorns, underbrush and Kalamata olives on the nose. The palate is also full of olives, from Kalamata to green, with damp sagebrush, forest floor and more green-peppercorn flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98248
"32523","Exceptionally sheer and crisp, Wölffer's standard-label rosé offers plenty of crisp-tart sour-cherry flavor along with herb and bramble notes. Made predominantly from Merlot and Chardonnay, it gains extra oomph from a supporting cast of four other red and white grape varieties.","Rosé","Rosé","US",32523
"17112","Smoky aromas of bacon and rubber lead the charge. The palate is good and ripe, with roasted berry, molasses and tangy acidity that's reflected via a lemony note. The finish has bite and shear to it along with flavors of olive and green herbs. Drink now.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",17112
"82421","In this full-bodied, well-earned Reserve-level wine, white peach, cantaloupe and lemon-lime define the ripeness of fruit on the palate, providing a fresh lushness around its substantive body and weight. A hit of decadent toffee lurks on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",82421
"90257","A slight majority of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with 47% Cabernet Franc to offer an explosion of chocolate, blackberry jam and bitter black tea against more classical undertones of brushy sage and cedar. A powerhouse of a wine, it finishes in grippy tannin and oak. Cellar through 2023.","Red","Red Blend","US",90257
"83149","This is a great everyday wine, with well-integrated aromas of pressed boysenberry, dried black cherry, black pepper and a touch of asphalt. Blueberry, beef crust, soy and pepper converge on the palate. The wine is smooth enough to work with a variety of dishes but packed with enough action to serve alone as well.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",83149
"26659","Zesty tangerine peel, apple and pear abound on this crisp, light-bodied Riesling. It's not a deeply concentrated wine but dry and spry. The finish is a touch earthy. Drink now.","White","Riesling","US",26659
"62563","The great flavor intensity comes from the sunny side of Vaudésir. The wine is rich, yet crisp and packed with lemon and apple fruits, a touch of spice and a steely, young aftertaste. It needs to age, so drink this from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",62563
"90848","This wine is very soft, rounded and gentle. A touch of light pepper accompanies melon and creamed pear flavors. It's a good apéritif wine and it can be paired with amuse-bouche.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",90848
"47060","Despite the wine being fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, the fruit shines through, with notes of corn silk, peach and tropical fruit accented by barrel spices. Texture and richness to the sweet fruit flavors keeps interest high.","White","Chardonnay","US",47060
"17286","Powdery notions of white peony petals against a stony background suggest concealed aromas that need time to come to the fore. Right now the palate is tight, with buffered acidity at the core, long, lean and promising. Lime zest lurks amid suspicions of ripe peaches in a sherbety, lemony sharpness. The wine will blossom as of 2017.","White","Riesling","Austria",17286
"9625","This is the kind of Rosso di Montalcino you could pair with seasoned pork or chicken curry. It has the heft and substance to stand up to those spicy foods and offers loads of fresh fruit intensity on the close.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",9625
"24320","There's red fruit and spice to be found in this Marlborough Pinot Noir, but unfortunately they're overpowered by a chemical, menthol quality, along with vanilla from the oak influence. The palate is medium bodied with lightly grippy tannins and a bitterness on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",24320
"15249","This tastes a bit on the sweet side, with flavors of white sugar, orange, lemon, lime and vanilla. Fortunately, there's a cut of crisp acidity that lends balance. The grapes come mainly from Lake County and Paso Robles.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",15249
"87817","Still young and fruity, this wine is totally integrated, harmoniously blending the red fruits with a tight texture and fresh acidity. Although it is drinkable now, it will benefit from bottle age, so best drink from 2017.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",87817
"64045","This 100% varietal wine was given two-and-a-half years in barrel, the majority of it new American oak. Smoky in character, it has a compressed and extracted feel, built around sizable punches of black plum, cedar, earth and coffee. It's big, but good.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",64045
"64719","This is a ripe, fruity wine, its herbaceous citrus character well blended with full melon and green apple flavors. Already attractive wine, it's full of crisp acidity and lively fruitiness.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",64719
"19889","A superfruity Viognier, an orchard in itself, offering ripe flavors of peaches, pears, lemons, limes, pineapples and nectarines. It's crisp in welcome acidity, with a honeyed finish. Nice for those who like their wines on the high alcohol, sweet side.","White","Viognier","US",19889
"73425","Aromas of tilled earth, blackberry, cedar and raisin jump from the glass. The dense palate delivers mocha, vanilla, mature plum, bitter prune and black pepper supported by velvety tannins. The warmth of alcohol shows on the finish. Masciarelli Wine Co, Vinity Wine.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",73425
"98018","Toasty and solid on the nose, with hints of mineral, dark spice, black olive and cassis. It's structured but a little rich and sticky, with sweet berry and cassis flavors along with brown sugar on the finish. A blend of six grapes that's easygoing and generous. Drink now through 2013.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",98018
"26174","Cabernet Franc is a regular part of the red blends made in St-Émilion in Bordeaux. This gem from the rich farmland of Lodi has vivid ripe plum and cherry aromas, and flavors tempered by traces of spice and mineral. With medium body and a firmly tannic texture it achieves classic balance.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",26174
"102140","A slightly reduced aroma unfurls from the glass, begging for more time to air before unfolding with structured layers of olive, sage and pomegranate. The acid-driven structure is noticeably lean and layered.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",102140
"9609","Whiffs of earth and spring ramps subside, exposing sunny peach and floral notes on this medium-sweet wine. The palate is satisfyingly juicy with honeyed peach and pear flavors, but anchored with a deep, savory complexity. Finishes long with sweet-tart citrus flavors and a murmur of dusty minerals.","White","Riesling","Germany",9609
"45327","This is one of the few commercial bottlings coming out of Mallorca, and it's a unique wine made mostly from Callet, a native variety. Aromas of rose petals, strawberry and potpourri are exotic and unfamiliar. This crackles with acidity and delivers savory flavors of BBQ meat, earthy red fruits and molasses. Racy on the finish, this cries out for food; drink through 2016.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",45327
"34509","Light aromas of candle wax, kiwi and citrus lead to diluted fruit flavors. It lacks a sense of cohesion or variety.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",34509
"101269","This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.","White","Chardonnay","US",101269
"72453","Aromas of blackberry jam, dried fruit and woodspice lead to full-bodied black fruit and vanilla flavors. Despite its youth, this wine seems advanced. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72453
"3907","After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.","White","Chardonnay","US",3907
"48789","Delicious in briary blackberry jam, cherry pie, currant, milk chocolate, black pepper and anise flavors, with a touch of sweet oak, and the finish is totally dry. It's a little too soft in structure, but fine if you're in the mood for Zinfandel.","Red","Zinfandel","US",48789
"1969","This pleasant, easy-drinking wine from five different Pinot Noir clones mixes citrus and berry flavors. It was aged in 30% new oak and is nicely balanced, with firm acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1969

"30947","With its distinctive flower bottle, this is an immediately recognizable Champagne, both in its looks and its distinctive Perrier-Jouët elegance. Lively white fruits play with acidity and a tangy backbone of apple skins. Age this for 4–5 years and maybe more.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",30947
"28755","Made from Nebbiolo aged in large casks, this garnet-colored wine offers lovely fragrances of rose petal and woodland berry. The elegant palate doles out crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and mineral, alongside smooth, polished tannins. Fresh acidity adds vibrancy. Drink through 2019.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",28755
"42849","A 50-50 blend of Pinot Bianco and Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of peach, honey and white rose. The quality of the bubbly perlage is tonic and crisp, but both grape varieties provide the wine with medium structure.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",42849
"61826","Hints of nut oil and smoke lend a savory tone to bright stone-fruit and floral notes on this delicate semidry Riesling. Brisk with lemon-lime acidity, it finishes long with a murmur of lanolin and honey comb.","White","Riesling","US",61826
"38408","Dry and full-bodied, this wine's pleasant herb, cherry, raisin and spice flavors, show some elegance.","Red","Merlot","US",38408
"73004","Zesty lemon and lime, with honey and blossom notes permeate this ethereally delicate semisweet Riesling. Despite it's diminutive frame, it's concentrated in citrus and stone fruit flavors. Finishes long on a honeyed saffron note.","White","Riesling","Germany",73004
"94169","Zinfandel fans will celebrate this powerfully ripe, exuberant wine. It's classic Russian River Zin, dry, tannic, heady and enormously rich in black currants, raisins, prunes, beef jerky and exotic baking spices. The finish is so fruity, it's almost sweet, yet is actually quite dry, making it clean and zesty.","Red","Zinfandel","US",94169
"47493","From the north of the Haut-Médoc, just outside Saint-Estèphe, this wine has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon. That yields black-currant fruit and tight tannins. The spice from wood aging will integrate as it matures to give a rich juicy wine. Drink from 2020.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",47493
"12898","A blend of wines from different Premier Cru vineyards, this is firm, as befits a Pommard, but has such great ripe fruit that it feels almost opulent. Lovely rich raspberry fruits are touched wit red currants and supported by solid tannins  at the end. Drink from 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",12898
"46546","Zesty lemon and lime acidity takes center stage in this invigorating medium-dry kabinett. It's leaner and more linear than the producer's regular-label kabinett, but offers loads of cutting white grapefruit and red apple flavors. The finish is refreshing and penetrating, lingering on a note of sugar cookie.","White","Riesling","Germany",46546
"23656","Lemon, apple and cleanliness define the nose on this everyday white that's priced to sell. The mouth is racy and fresh, with peach, apple and citrus flavors that lead to a fairly long, clean and flavorful finish. Drink now.","White","White Blend","Spain",23656
"75861","Cedar, ground pepper, cassis, scorched earth and tobacco aromas lead the way on this powerfully structured red. The chewy full-bodied palate doles out dried black cherry, black currant, fig, licorice and dark bitter chocolate set against a backbone of ripe and solid tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",75861
"76365","This is a pocket-size blend of 57% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petite Sirah and 1% Cabernet Franc. It's soft and drinkable, marrying red currant and cherry with softened tannins and an easy approachability.","Red","Red Blend","US",76365
"74296","Ripe, rooty aromas of licorice, leather and peanut are matched by cedar, tobacco and other complex scents. This mature Cafayate classic is still rugged and solid on the palate despite showing a rusting color. Flavors of chocolate, prune and baking spices finish deep, with rooty, chocolaty notes and pent-up energy. Drink now.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",74296
"61654","Despite the age of this wine, it's still bright and lively, with clean and upfront aromas and flavors of orange citrus, white melon rind, white peach and firm pear. The palate is vibrant and fresh, with mouthwatering acidity that follows through to the toast-laced finish.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",61654
"50776","Made in a light style, this has a silky texture that's marked by high acidity. It's dry, with sour cherry and raspberry candy flavors. Ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50776
"53671","A lesson in elegant restraint, it offers a subtle nose of eucalyptus, rhubarb and roasted root vegetables, followed by reticently emergent flavors of cherry, blackberry and wet dirt. Extremely delicate with vibrant acidity, this wine only comes out of its shell when paired with a good meal.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53671
"97185","This 70-30 Corvina and Rondinella Amarone blend is slightly disjointed on the nose with contrasting aromas of toasted oak and ripe fruit. It makes a nice impression in the mouth, however, thanks to its smooth, rich texture.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",97185
"23779","This is a heavily oaked Carmenère, so aromas of caramel, vanilla and licorice share space on the bouquet with stewed, foresty notes. Plump and saturated in feel, this is more mellow and soft than tough or tannic. Roasted blackberry, toast and spicy oak flavors end big and heavily, with leftover oak and herbal notes. Drink through 2018.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",23779
"32427","The winery's annual 100% new French-oak bottling, this is rich and smoky, with heavily clove-laced blackberry and blueberry juice, dark strawberry, nutmeg and gingerbread spice on the nose. Similar flavors show on the palate, from mace to dried ginger. A bright red-cherry and cranberry character lifts the sip, as does the juniper and forest-floor finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32427
"36851","Citrus and apple aromas are dusty. This is easygoing and just juicy enough, with apple, orange and tangerine flavors. A clean finish turns softer and more mealy the longer it sits.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",36851
"10448","There's a touch of Band-Aid or used leather that falls to the background the more the wine spends time in the glass. Cherry and white almond are the leading aromatic accents and this blend of Sangiovese (80%), Merlot and Cabernet is simple and fresh in the mouth.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",10448
"37230","Aromas of prune, licorice and dark fruit lead to full cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a sense of vitality and liveliness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",37230

"711","The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.","Red","Grenache","US",711
"89398","This 14.5% bruiser contains 20% Viognier, which adds a tropical fruit character to the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors heavy on banana and melon. Woody characteristics such as nuttiness, particularly almonds, also pop up. To its detriment, the oak and fruit seem to be fighting each other more than complementing one another.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",89398
"7444","Upfront aromas of smoke and spring ramps subside to reveal delicate apple blossom notes on this honeyed, medium-sweet wine. Ripe, rich yellow peach and cantaloupe flavors flood the palate, yet wrap up remarkably dry with a lingering finish that's intense with minerality. It's gorgeously styled, yet elegant and dainty.","White","Riesling","Germany",7444
"95712","Sweaty, nutty aromas of popcorn and nettle lead to a chunky, somewhat soft palate. Flavors of mango, bell pepper and sea salt are fair, while the finish is ripe and relatively soft, with mild cut. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",95712
"79389","Underripe peach, candied lemon and white flower aromas are lifted and bright on the nose. The palate is zesty and crisp, with ripe red-apple flavors leading to a slightly chalky finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",79389
"70757","The wine is young, which explains the intense acidity and flavors of currants as well as citrus. It is right up front with its fruitiness. Bright acidity shines through and gives the wine delicious, ready-to-drink character.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",70757
"56660","This Pinot is all about fruit, which is both its strength and its limitation. Raspberries, strawberries, persimmons are there, alongside caramelized, buttery oak. The finish is tannic and dry. Drink by 2016, after decanting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",56660
"40543","Reticent dark fruit and licorice aromas are followed by tart fruit flavors and lightly bunched-up tannins. There's interest but it doesn't all seem to come together.","Red","Syrah","US",40543
"4726","The Grenache (20%) blended in shows itself with its aromas of raspberry and spice complementing Syrah's blue fruit. The flavors are full bodied and lush, pulling no punches but staying in balance.","Red","Syrah","US",4726
"95901","For affordable, everyday Pinot Noir, this fresh, tasty number does the job. Tomato and herbal aromas complement lighter red-fruit scents, while the palate feels airy and easy. The flavor profile is snappy, with notes of red plum and raspberry backed by oak-based caramel and milk chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",95901
"59030","Straw-gold in color, bright and stylish, this wine focuses on apple, white peach and green-banana fruit. It's firm and pulls through to a barrel-detailed finish with a lick of caramel.","White","Chardonnay","US",59030
"12384","Slightly more graceful and elegant than the same winery's Mathilde Reserve, which comes across as a bit chunky and oaky. This wine features cherry and vanilla notes, with a slightly creamy, easy-to-like texture in the mouth.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",12384
"5096","This 100% varietal wine leads with woodspice, green herb and flower aromas and follows with sweet, vanilla-laced black fruit flavors. Although aged entirely in used French oak, the barrel influence is prominent. The tannins bring dryness, needing food to ease their grit.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",5096
"55634","Sweet, forward aromas of mocha, blackberry, cotton candy and vanilla signal a rich wine. The palate is round and chunky, with a spot of elegance but more size and force. Flavors of chunky blackberry are slightly salty and salinic at the edges, while overall it's thick, fruity and black in nature. Drink now through 2012.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",55634
"8730","Peppery spice and a nose of violets and roses mark the entry and midpalate of this wine, priced moderately for the appellation. Layered, with a twinge of yeasty baked bread, it has a strong personality, stemmy and feral, with a lasting linger of grenadine.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8730
"59722","An approachable screwcap wine that is made in larger numbers than many of the producer's vineyard-designates, this is just as impressive in flavor and presence, employing less oak to provide a honeyed, tropical and fresh sensibility of drying tannin and a tangy finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",59722

"102254","Tarry black-cherry aromas are a bit damp, oaky and scratchy, but overall this opens well. A solid, firm, edgy palate offers flavors of herbal blackberry and baked black plum, while the finish is meaty and a touch salty.","Red","Merlot","Chile",102254
"16190","This wine is a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 11% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot.

The flavors are pitch black and generous, showing density and layering.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",16190
"70580","Bold lychee, honeydew and stone-fruit perfume adorns this varietally classic Gewürztraminer. Its tastes just a shade off dry, its hibiscus-nectar sweetness accenting sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Sunny acidity and integrated alcohol tie the package together smartly. Drink now through 2020.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",70580
"10708","Elegant and polished, this brings raspberry pastry flavors, a touch of crème brûlée and scents of light toast to a wine with impressive length. It was fermented with wild yeasts and aged 18 months in 25% new French oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","Canada",10708
"52274","Blueberry, blackberry, smoke and white pepper unite to create a mysterious, almost brooding impression. This is still tightly coiled, but the flowing, silky-smooth palate with its slender poise and core of freshness suggest that with a little bottle age, this will emerge as a supremely elegant, subtly fruited wine. The finish turns away from darker fruit and ends on ripe, red cherry.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",52274
"32126","Think Crozes-Hermitage and you'll have a reasonable idea of what this wine is about: White pepper and cherry aromas and flavors, medium body without being overly rich or textured and a crisp, peppery finish. Drink it over the next couple of years with burgers and the like.","Red","Syrah","New Zealand",32126
"52380","This simple style of Marlborough Pinot delivers notes of bramble berry, licorice and cola on the nose, with a slightly more complex palate of dark cherry, mocha spice and dried leaves. The oak is a little prevalent throughout and texturally it's on the lean and mean side, but the fruit carries through until the end, keeping the gluggability factor up.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",52380
"52821","Briary spice and wild berry aromas set up a palate with a core of raspberry flavor mixed with a mild dose of greenness. The finish is clean and standard—fruity and not bashful.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",52821
"57962","Intense color, intense hot aromas and intense blackberry-jam flavors make this an extreme, full-bodied wine. It has plenty of tannins and an overtone of heat in the aroma and the finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",57962
"66867","A strongly herbal, garrigue character dominates the overall personality of this wine, but is supported by ample black plum and cherry notes to keep it from being overly earthy or green. Firm, slightly astringent tannins coat the palate and remain well into the finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",66867
"71720","This savory Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of bell pepper, red currant and plum that carry over to the palate, along with toasted sensations of espresso and oak. Its linear structure will pair well with grilled chicken seasoned with rosemary and grilled vegetables.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",71720
"6222","Dry and scoury in texture, this everyday Merlot has flavors of cherries, currants, cocoa, and cedar. It has some real richness.","Red","Merlot","US",6222
"11880","Aromas of tomato sauce and red-wine vinegar create sharpness on the nose. Plum and raspberry flavors run short, with a fresh, basic finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",11880
"46142","Choppy plum and berry aromas are mildly raw and herbaceous, but not overly so. Round and standard in feel, this Malbec tastes of creamy, herbal berry fruits that turn slightly green and oaky. Peppery, medicinal, herbal flavors drive the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",46142
"12319","An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.","White","Chardonnay","US",12319
"62507","With fairly muted fruit flavors and a hint of green pepper, this lighter-bodied and easy-drinking wine will pair well with most meat or chicken entrées. Flash-pasteurized and mevushal, this is a blend of 50% Cab, 30% Merlot and 20% Shiraz.","Red","Red Blend","Israel",62507
"104148","Familiar aromas of herbs and olive make up the nose along with berry scents and hints of tree bark and mocha. A choppy palate is shrill with tartaric acidity. Spicy berry and plum flavors turn lean on a scrubbing finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",104148
"86717","A curiously earthy wine with ripe fruits but also a sense of bitterness. Notes of gooseberries and undergrowth finish with an off-dry character at the end. Screwcap.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",86717
"29643","Shows lots of flashy, ripe Zin character, with a blast of wild berry, tobacco, currant, nettle and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rough-edged, calling for big, rich fare, like barbecue.","Red","Zinfandel","US",29643
"2757","Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",2757
"5059","Black pepper, blackberry and beef char give a savory style to this bottling, which also has lighter touches of violets and other purple flowers. The palate shows espresso laid across ripe blueberry fruit that carries through the sip, framed by strong but judicious tannins, and spiced with a dill-tarragon character.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",5059
"94767","This is the winery's reserve, made just once previously, in 2010. Rich, deep and chewy, it brings black cherry fruit to the front and center, streaked with highlights of earth and iron. Big at first, the wine seems to lighten up through the finish, with lemon and orange-peel notes leading into a pleasant wash of chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94767
"48101","New wood aging gives this fine wine its smooth, ripe texture. It is rich and full of spice and generous tannins. It is dense with plum skin and blackberry fruits. Drink the wine from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",48101
"85608","This wine is delicious, citrus- and yellow fruit-flavored, crisp and intensely fruity. With layers of acidity, a zesty texture and a bright aftertaste, it's already ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",85608
"87649","For the winery's lower-priced offering, this is a stunner. Baked black cherry, vanilla, raspberry, rose petals and a touch of licorice light up the nose. The lightly poised but intensely focused sip reveals a wild combo of fruit and spice, with sage, bay leaf, thyme and fennel laced through black cherry. It's like walking through the Central Coast scrubland.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87649
"9696","This off-dry wine offers fresh acidity and delicious hints of honey and yellow fruits. It is fruity, rich while still full of the typical freshness of young Chenin Blanc. Let the wine round out and drink from 2017.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",9696
"10569","The winemaker pulled out all the bells and whistles, barrel fermenting this Chardonnay, putting it through partial malolactic fermentation, and aging it on the lees. The result is a rich, creamy wine, ripe in pineapple, orange, pear, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors, and brightened with brisk Carneros acidity. Shows impeccable balance, at a fair price.","White","Chardonnay","US",10569
"53986","Leafy, earthy aromas of raisin, baked plum and leather are oaky but also a touch green. High acidity creates an upright, juicy mouthfeel, while shrill, acid-driven flavors of plum and berry fruits end with a green reprise as well as flavors of tobacco and citrus peel. This will last a long, long time; drink through 2030.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",53986
"91458","Inky violet in color, this wine has a bouquet of blueberry, vanilla and nutmeg. At first sip, coolness makes its presence known, but flavors of blueberry, cherry, white chocolate and orange rind ultimately dominate notes of eucalyptus. The cherry-chocolate finish is awash in velvety tannins.","Red","Shiraz","Israel",91458
"86956","This dry, full-bodied wine has lots of rich, exuberant blackberry and black currant flavors accented by smoky oak. It's a little heavy, and not likely to age, so decant it for a few hours before service.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",86956
"16538","This is an elegant, smooth wine that draws out the freshness of the vintage as much as the fruitiness. It has ripe, soft tannins, juicy red-fruit flavors and an intriguing smokiness. With acidity holding the wine in check, it should age well. Drink from 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",16538
"12936","From the mighty mountainous site, this 100% varietal wine is densely compact and thick, with a lift of acidity that keeps it fresh despite its power. Black currant, black cherry, graphite and sage combine effortlessly to provide fruit and complexity.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",12936
"77715","There's no mistaking the variety with this wine's aromas of herbs, dried tobacco, coffee, flowers and cherry. It dazzles with its supple feel and exquisitely balanced cherry flavors that carry off into the distance.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",77715
"88707","Firm, hard, tart and chewy, this has tight black fruits, high acids and earthy tannins, which are lightened with a note of pretty baking spice.","Red","Merlot","US",88707
"61663","Spicy new-oak flavors dominate the modest fruit notes in this over-worked wine, knocking it off balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",61663
"29598","This is a full-bodied and ripe wine, showing some toastiness as well as concentrated apple and peach flavors. There is a crisp edge to this opulent and rich wine. It has a great future: it is drinkable now, but will continue well into the 2020s.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",29598
"817","Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",817
"33245","At this stage, this wine is closed and packed with acidity. But just wait for a few years and the ripe wood and yellow fruits will emerge. It's a full-bodied, rich wine that needs to round out. Drink from 2016.","White","Chardonnay","France",33245
"18399","Just next door to the Corton Grand Cru vines, this vineyard can produce wines of equal quality. This wine certainly has something of the richness and structure, giving it concentration and longevity. Ripe red fruits are cut by dark tannins and equal acidity, allowing the wine to mature slowly and well. Drink from 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",18399
"83549","From the new Happy Canyon appellation, this wine is so close to being so good. It's dry and rich in acidity, and complex in blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish long and sweet. This new 7200 line from Foxen is worth watching over future vintages.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",83549
"89911","Hot, soft and simple, with baked fruit flavors of cherries and red currants that turn raisiny on the finish. On the plus side, it's dry and silky.","Red","Merlot","US",89911
"88890","A relatively light-tasting wine from a sometimes heavy grape variety, this shows a mix of savory and fruit flavors, including cucumber, celery and white pepper. It tastes dry and almost austere, which is appealing in the right pairing, such as with goat cheese on toast.","White","Viognier","US",88890
"26773","Black cherry, smoked beef jerky, burned caramel and a touch of maduro cigar show on the nose of this study of a popular Syrah clone. The palate is equally savory, with smoked meats, blackberry fruit, crushed black pepper, soy and a tarry edge, bolstered by sparkling acidity.","Red","Syrah","US",26773
"36093","Note the remarkably low alcohol! Not surprisingly, this is a searingly tart wine, the acidity further emphasized by stainless steel fermentation and aging. Nonetheless, flavors are rich and deep, a lemon and grapefruit explosion that seems to demand raw oysters. Definitely a wine for acid lovers.","White","Chardonnay","US",36093
"95495","Lots of smoky, spicy oak on this wine. The wood is the dominant feature right now, overshadowing the blackberry, cherry,  cassis and cocoa flavors. The mountain tannins also are strong, suggesting ageability. Should hold and soften through 2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95495
"33137","Despite its light-as-a-feather demeanor, a crush of bright red cherry and cranberry flavors pulsate from this dazzling Cabernet Franc. It's refreshingly thirst quenching, yet elegant enough to savor through a long, herb and bramble-toned finish. Drink now through 2016.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",33137
"69016","This blend of 60% Syrah, 21% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre and 2% Petite Sirah pulses with racy red fruit and sizzling acidity. Fiercely tannic, it builds in sweet flavors as it opens, recalling graham cracker, marshmallow and chocolate—a children's treat in a glass. The texture is leathery and wholly satisfying.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",69016
"100804","Red cherries, sagebrush and dried violets show on the nose of this clonal selection. The medium-bodied palate offers even-keeled flavors of red cherry, cranberry and cracked pepper, providing lots of flavorful action on a relatively light frame.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100804
"46243","Sprightly and delicious, with grapefruit, fig, Meyer lemon and apricot flavors made even brighter by vibrant acidity. This elegant SB will be delicious with a salad of bitter greens, figs, chèvre and grilled shrimp.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",46243
"81233","This wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional, Merlot and Syrah, giving fruit, fresh berry flavors and acidity. It has some structure, showing a dry background to the forward juicy flavors. It should be better in a year, so drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",81233
"579","Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak. With a dense texture, layers of spice and vanilla as well as intense red fruits, this powerful wine expresses the more complex side of Provence rosé. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",579
"77756","When people ask us, “What's your favorite value wine from Argentina,” the pet answer is this one, Pascual Toso. A former Best Buy of the year, the '07 keeps the streak of great values alive. It's round, balanced and loaded with holes-free berry and cassis aromas and flavors. It is also layered, long and composed.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",77756
"40703","Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",40703
"93889","In the old times, a Douro vineyard held a muddle of any number of different local grapes. This wine, from 80-year-old vines, is a tribute to the old style of vineyard planting. It's firm, very concentrated and dark, with stunning tannins and rich fruit. The black plum-skin texture, superripe fruit, chocolate and final acidity are all developing slowly and impressively. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",93889
"11556","Though billed as a red blend, this is made from 98% Merlot and does justice to the variety. Complete on the entry in ripe fruit, it offers dusty cedar, graphite and oak elements within a cool-climate sensibility of savory grace and balance.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",11556
"15761","Bone dry and tart in acidity, with a silky texture, this Pinot has cherry and rhubarb flavors with an edge of fresh green herbs and peppercorns. It's elegantly structured, and meant for early drinking.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15761
"81207","An easy-drinking Shiraz, Sidewood's 2007 features a creamy texture, hints of mint and vanilla and copious raspberry fruit. It's crisp on the finish to help balance the softness of the tannins. Drink now–2017.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",81207
"68870","Chiroubles is highest of the Beaujolais cru villages, producing wines with good structure. This wine, with its firm tannins, shows some aging potential. It has acidity and ripe red-plum flavors over a dry core. Drink from 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",68870
"99469","You can almost just smell this wine and be completely satisfied: its earth, black currant, flower, vanilla and sandalwood aromas are so intoxicating. A further venture, however, is rewarded. The dark fruit flavors are dense and full yet still fresh and lively with a finish that sails. It's a compelling example of Washington Cabernet that drinks beautifully now, but a few years (or more) in the cellar will be rewarded as well.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99469
"49029","Quite light in color, this wine has a ton to like, starting with its thyme, oregano, juniper and tart cranberry aromas. The palate is overloaded with energy, showing snappy raspberry, kalamata olive and iron-rich mineral notes. A great example of fresh Pinot Noir.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49029
"37777","This wine has an exuberant, juicy quality to it that is extremely attractive for solo sipping. Bright berry and spice on the nose are followed by mouthwatering, round fruit in the mouth. Pepper and spice mingle with good structure and a long finish, making this an impressive showing from Schultz.","Red","Syrah","South Africa",37777
"45223","Banyan specializes in Alsatian whites at affordable prices, and they should be on your radar. This '08 Gewurz is very rich in citrus, honeysuckle, candied ginger, vanilla and Asian spice flavors that are slightly sweet and almost off-dry. Fortunately, crisp acidity provides balance.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",45223
"33021","The aromas are all high toned, with notes of mortared fresh herbs, blueberry pie, citrus, black pepper and whiffs of smoked meat. The palate is dense and rich, tightly focused and flavorful with a meaty streak that runs throughout and a finish that lingers.","Red","Syrah","US",33021
"19743","Sourced from mature plantings in cool sites, this exemplary Riesling is technically off dry, but retains its apple-fresh snap and tang. The sweet/tart fruit flavors include abundant peaches, nectarines and apples, and the mouthfeel is ripe and full, the finish lingering.","White","Riesling","US",19743
"31913","This exciting project comes from veteran winemaker William Hill. Although it's packed with rich black-currant and cassis-liqueur flavors that sink down in the midpalate and offer fruity satisfaction, the finish is firm and classic. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows those mountain tannins but also fine minerality. Drink 2017–2025.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",31913
"37123","This is brimming with the tropical fruit, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors typical of Viognier. Dry and elegant, it is ripe, but shows the acidity from the cool 2010 vintage.","White","Viognier","US",37123
"11276","Meager and slightly thin, this offers red fruit, herbal cedar and tobacco, though the flavors are subtle and hard to make out.","Red","Merlot","US",11276
"51740","Light and gently spicy, this first-ever varietal Grenache from Sineann offers cranberry, pomegranate and boysenberry fruit, lots of acid and a quick fade.","Red","Grenache","US",51740
"11551","A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Shiraz, 14% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Malbec, this clean, approachable red offers notes of black plum, cherry, cocoa and spice on the nose and mouth. A peppery heat on the tongue lingers through the medium finish, as do the dusty tannins.","Red","Red Blend","South Africa",11551
"81104","Subdued aromas suggest leather, dried tobacco leaf, prune and fennel. The hearty palate offers stewed prune, dried black cherry, licorice and a black pepper note alongside assertive tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",81104
"1444","This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",1444
"69431","This is an elegant, pretty, lightly oaked white that's stony and savory with lemongrass, nutmeg and a strong crunch of green apple. Its depth of body and ripeness complement its more exotic elements.","White","Chardonnay","US",69431
"41223","Appealing aromas of cedar, vanilla, smoke and cherry are followed by a full creamy-feeling palate loaded with fresh cherry flavors along with abundant barrel accents. It hits a lot of high notes, with a lengthy finish capping it off.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",41223
"24442","Earthy and delicious, this soulful red opens with aromas of sun-baked soil, leather, ripe black fruit, dark spice and a funky but pleasant whiff of game. The round, smooth tastes of juicy blackberry, wild cherry, cinnamon, black olive, cured meat and mineral framed in silky tannins. It's already enjoyable, with depth and balance but it will age well for another decade or more. Drink through 2026.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",24442
"75046","This ample-bodied wine boasts appealing buttered apple and citrus flavors to go with subtle touches of cinnamon and clove. Despite being unoaked, it shows plenty of weight and a fair amount of complexity; the only drawback is a touch of warmth on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",75046
"21999","Earthy, leathery aromas are hot and end up smelling like a field in summertime. It feels hard on the palate, with a buttery oak note that sets up flavors of plum and raspberry mixed with green herb.","Red","Merlot","Chile",21999
"53053","La Fortuna's Rosso offers contrasting aromas of spice, red apple, wild berry, bramble and cherry liqueur. It boasts a deep ruby color and in the mouth, it feels pointed and edgy.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",53053
"53192","Flat on the nose, with neutral, slightly floral aromas. The palate is zesty and tart, with midland flavors of lemon, sour apple and lime. Chalky but o.k. on the finish. A one-dimensional white with hardly any lasting potential.","White","Pinot Gris","Argentina",53192
"104184","An easygoing ripe red, with the minerality of the Dão rounded into sweeter damson and red berry fruits. There's an attractive layer of acidity for freshness. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",104184
"39312","Toasty, inviting aromas of apple and melon lead to a balanced palate with layered flavors of resiny oak, pear and peach. The finish continues with resin and oak, but by then it has already established itself as a well-balanced wine, with tasty flavors of white and tropical fruit.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",39312
"9247","Herbaceous and brambly on the nose and palate, Wölffer's Estate Merlot is concentrated in red plum and cherry fruit but lean in structure, with lively acidity and a softly tannic finish. It drinks well now, but it could benefit from decanting.","Red","Merlot","US",9247
"1442","From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",1442
"2322","Cherry, raspberry and vanilla combine for an inviting mix of ripeness and sweet bouquet. A fruity component also sits nicely atop this structured wine marked by soft, fine tannins. The finish is robust in black pepper and clove.","Red","Merlot","US",2322
"80276","Cut with 25% Merlot, aromas of fresh herb, coffee, graphite, cocoa and cherry are followed by lightly styled fruit flavors that taper toward the finish. It shows a very pretty sense of elegance.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",80276
"84163","Old-fashioned Petite Sirah, dark, heavy and hot in alcohol. It tastes overripe, with extracted flavors of raisins and prunes, leading to a bitter finish.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",84163
"37124","Pretty aromatic layers of mint, cola, almond paste, blueberry and currant mark this wine. The mouthfeel is silky and clean, and there's a bright note of acidity on the finish.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",37124
"57669","There's no oak at all on this savory young Sauvignon Blanc, which delivers its richness directly to the palate, undiluted. Those flavors are of green fruits: melons, apples, limes and the slightly sour, flowery tang of gooseberries. Fine acidity makes it all brisk and mouthwatering. An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for today's ethnic fare, at a great price.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",57669
"52402","Dense and massive, this wine is still a baby. It gives it more tannin than fruit at this stage, very concentrated and with a dry, solid core. The fruit is there to feel, a rich mélange of black fruits and firm tannins. This powerful wine needs to age, so don't drink before 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",52402
"104371","As with other wines produced by the Dulon family, this suffers from too much oak. Here it shows in the wood acidity, the burnt character and the bitter coffee flavors. It's a shame because somewhere under there is fruit. A year or two more will help, so wait until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",104371
"67098","This is a high acid, dry and minerally Chardonnay that you can call Chablisian. It has flavors of grilled lemons, limes and pineapples, with richer notes of sweet oak and lees and the buttered toast of oak. Defined by elegance, it should develop bottle complexities over the next three or four years.","White","Chardonnay","US",67098
"85200","Actress Challen Cates got interested in wine when her father ran Tantara Winery. She's since hired winemaker Kevin Law to deliver great bottlings like this one. It's redolent with sarsaparilla, red plum, mulberry and cola, and shows deft balance on the palate, combining plum, cherry, licorice and ginger flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85200
"52879","Medium intense notes of sweet grass, fresh red apple slices, green melon and lime citrus on the nose and mouth. Medium weight with moderate, supporting acidity and a clean finish. Drink now.","White","White Blend","France",52879
"97377","Spicy and completely dry, this fresh and fruity rosé is a pretty strawberry and salmon shade, with persistent flavors of cherry candy, lemon oil and nougat. There's a nice citrus snap to the finish.","Red","Sangiovese","US",97377
"91443","A dark and brooding aspect of smoke hangs over the black cherry fruit. This is still a little closed but the palate reveals elegance and concentration and wonderfully palpable chiffon tannins. This is fresh and has pure focus with some hints of iron oxide and a slight dusting of pepper: a wine of great charm.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",91443
"29681","While the wine is dominated by flavors of wood aging, it also has fine fruit weight that will come through. Then it will be a powerful and concentrated wine, rich and full of blackberry and black plum fruits. The structure will keep this fruitiness in order. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",29681
"55044","This is an impressive still young wine. With its dense texture and powerful tannins it is concentrated, packed with ripe berry flavors and juicy acidity. It is bold, certainly not reticent, made for some long-term aging. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",55044
"62185","The berry flavors in this wine are fighting to emerge, but they are overwhelmed by dusty tannins and a lack of texture.","Red","Zinfandel","US",62185
"31967","A golden-colored wine, it's perfumed and rich. The wood aging shows strongly along with the delicious, fragrant fruits. Toasty and ripe, the wine is ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",31967
"3392","Sharply aromatic with peppery herb, bramble and thistle, this has a substantial core of cranberry fruit. Tannins are chewy, and the earthy, herbal characteristics, along with unintegrated oak (both French and American) dominate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3392
"51476","Fragrant notes of spiced plum, cherry and milk chocolate are met with toast and herbs on the palate. The acidity is a façade to smooth, sheer tannins and the finish is layered in oak and cocoa.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",51476
"60035","This ethereal, crisp white is pretty in guava and melon, approachable, easy to enjoy and not fussy. The majority of the experience is in the beginning and midpalate.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",60035
"41797","This bottling comes off a select corner of the Talley family ranch and is quite shy on the nose at first, reluctantly offering beet, cranberry, and cooked strawberry aromas, with the slightest touch of caramelization and loam. The flavors tend toward bramble, with wild thyme, white pepper and oregano, starting off simple but growing persistent and beautiful as the wine opens.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",41797
"3223","Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",3223
"95298","Made from 100% Cabernet, an interesting, complex wine, showing cool climate notes of mint, cassis, cloves and blackberries. Lots of sweet ripeness underneath the tannins, and a coating of sweet, smoky oak. Decant and drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95298
"84442","A zippy, lively version, this light-bodied wine smells and tastes like a combo of grapefruit, lemon and peach juices, having a crisp character on first sip, and a rich softness on the second.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",84442
"7003","An intriguing, distinctive nose combines hickory smoke, baked raspberry and a touch of sage. Dark-red cherry and cranberry meet with thyme on the sip, where swirling flavors strive to find a centerline.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7003
"77080","While this foamy rosé is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.","Rosé","Rosé","Spain",77080
"42225","La Grenouille, the frog, is a soft, creamy wine, but with a great waft of acidity, like biting into a green apple. The citrus element is there, but it's that apple flavor and texture that dominates.","White","Melon","France",42225
"42719","From Etna's beautiful Guardiola cru, this unoaked Chardonnay delivers fantastically fresh aromas of mountain herbs, tomato leaf, citrus and peach. It's a sophisticated and intriguing wine thanks to the mineral and brimstone notes that appear on the tail end.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",42719
"23710","Leathery, dried cherry fruit flavors are set against streaks of earth, herb and a hint of barnyard. It's soft and eminently accessible, the tannins smooth and supple, with a hint of vanilla.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",23710
"39888","The smokiness which on the nose melds seamlessly with red apple flavors becomes more dominant on the palate, revealing a rounded nuttiness. There is a creamy lemon freshness, too: an internationally recogniable Chardonnay style but with the purity of Austrian fruit and continental freshness.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",39888
"66519","This genre-busting blend of 54% Viognier, 22% Vermentino, 15% Verdelho and 9% Sauvignon Blanc invites the nose with ripe red and pink apples, lime blossoms and zest and a shred of bubble gum. The quite-ripe palate sizzles with cider notes as well as more lime and Gala apple elements.","White","White Blend","US",66519
"70074","The estate's reserve, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon has been given 22 months in new French oak. Sculpted and well-defined, it offers raspberry and blueberry fruit, set in lovely tannins. The finish shows details of orange blossoms, citrus and coffee grounds. At this time, the new oak is a bit overwhelming, but additional bottle age or decanting for several hours will help to balance it out.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",70074
"27518","On the north bank of the river, the remote Quinta dos Canais has produced a ripe, richly textured, perfumed wine that's packed with sweet berry flavor. It is concentrated, complete and softly tannic, suggesting medium-term aging.","Port","Port","Portugal",27518
"80938","An effusive, unabashedly fruity wine that's loaded with grapey, black-cherry fruit. Some sweaty-leather notes on the nose bring you back to the Rhône Valley, and a dash of green peppercorns spices up the finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",80938
"31112","Rather racy and lean for a Pfalz Riesling, with crisp lime sherbet and green apple aromas and flavors. This is light in weight, yet not lacking in power or intensity.","White","Riesling","Germany",31112
"69005","Initially, this is all about lemon and yellow grapefruit—all citrus freshness, lightness and zip. It is on only on the midpalate that some of the lovely nettle and passion fruit notes come through. Drink soon for its utter liveliness.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Austria",69005
"77044","This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is clumsy. Although it's dry, it shows an unpleasantly green, minty sharpness to the cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","US",77044
"32509","The Holstein designate offers pretty flavors of cherry and brambly berry, along with the Dr. Pepper character often found in Oregon. It's drinking well, though lacking the concentration that you would anticipate from the vintage and AVA.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32509
"89914","Sugary and simple, with jammy raspberry, cherry and oak flavors that finish a bit hot and peppery.","Red","Syrah","US",89914
"4953","A blend of the two major grapes of the region, Alvarinho and Loureiro, and grown at the home estate of the producer, this is delicious Vinho Verde. It is dry, crisp, light and piercingly bright, perfect either as an apéritif or with seafood. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",4953
"51111","Styring releases their wines with plenty of bottle age and doesn't shy from high alcohol. The level of ripeness in this bottling is not for everyone, veering more toward Zin-like power than Pinot Noir elegance. It's lushly aromatic, with dominant pine needle and raspberry extract flavors. A dense, concentrated and pungent wine with a spicy top note.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51111
"26292","Notes of peach pit, wet stone, tomato leaf and struck match are tied together by a medium body and prickly acidity, finishing with melon rind and more green leafy flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",26292
"42438","The vineyard of the Giennois is close to the city of Orléans, making it the most northerly Loire vineyard. This wine with its cool, fresh character has a light tannic character and brings out red fruits as its biggest attraction. It has a fresh, crisp, juicy aftertaste. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","France",42438
"23302","This is all about classic spicy Gewurztraminer. It's full and rounded, with candied flavors, great spice and a medium-sweet character. It's not subtle, but it is all there.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",23302
"83967","Ripe red fruits and strong minerality give this wine both its crispness and structure. It has style and elegance, as well as plenty of fruit. Drink this attractive wine from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",83967
"66500","Fondo Antico offers a clean and pretty Nero d'Avola without those messy, charred aromas you sometimes find in cheap versions of this indigenous grape. The nose is well put together, with elements of cherry, spice, almond and fresh citrus zest.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",66500
"78750","This Riesling is a beautiful rose-copper color. Fresh flavors of white stone fruit and straw on the palate, with more of the same, plus some custard or cream, on the nose. It's medium-bodied and is more elegant than it is zippy or fresh. Finishes clean, with hay and peach.","White","Riesling","Australia",78750
"50664","Powerfully structured, this is a dense wine, with layers of ripe fruit as well as tannins. It is concentrated, firm and showing its structure. The black plum fruit flavors from the 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon blend give weight and a broad character to the aftertaste. Drink from 2017. Produced by Alliance Bourg.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",50664

"93317","Fresh mint and cracked pepper accent dark plummy fruit on the nose, picking up hints of dark chocolate and black olive on the palate. It's full bodied, creamy in feel and loaded with supple tannins, which make the wine approachable now, but should sustain it through at least 2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",93317
"11174","This appears to be a wine that's simply over-reached. Noticeably high-toned, with a vinegary bite to the cherry flavored fruit, it's pushed it a bit too far. Not even 28 months in three quarters new French oak can mask the volatility.","Red","Red Blend","US",11174
"32211","Owner Michel Dietrich takes the vegan route with no animal derivatives in fining the wine. The wine is taut and tight, with a steely texture that needs to soften. All its fruit is there, muted by the herbal edge and nervy texture. Drink from late 2017.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",32211
"45997","A big oaky can't-miss blast of clove and wood spice is more dominating than secondary berry aromas. This is resiny and full in body, with ample acidity. Oak plays a lead role on the flavor profile, which includes toast, mint and herbal black plum. A peppery toasty finish benefits from moderate juicy acidity. Drink through 2021.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",45997
"39191","Nero d'Avola, Cabernet and Merlot are blended to produce a bold, oak-driven wine with smoky tones of campfire and coal. There are blackberries, prunes and plums in there as well and the wine has a chewy, succulent feel.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",39191

Red fruits and brown spice power the palate, with noticeable tannins and a good wash of acid on the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",62230
"4084","Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.","White","Gewürztraminer","Italy",4084
"26381","The wine is dull, without great character other than some light fruitiness and a hint of wood aging. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",26381

Hints of mushroom and wet soil, along with penetrating, chewy tannins, add depth and balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78335
"74887","In the south of the Médoc, close to Bordeaux, this chateau has produced a ripe fruity wine. It has a fine balance between tannins and juicy black fruits. The blend, with its equal balance between Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, gives richness along with firm structure. Drink from 2019.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",74887
"86099","A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip.","White","Chardonnay","US",86099
"20439","Lushly textured, this weaves sophisticated flavors of pear and apple around a creamy center. The finish is light in oak and tropical vanilla, a nice complement to the crisp fruitiness.","White","Chardonnay","US",20439
"30127","Rubbery and hard on the nose, but with solid berry and cassis aromas lying in wait. The palate is solid, fresh and good, with raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. Finishes dry and herbal but there's enough fruit and clarity to push it up a notch or two.","Red","Merlot","Chile",30127
"102804","Uccelliera's savory Rosso offers a compact mouthfeel, with bright acidity, silky tannins and bright berry aromas. Pair this wine with lamb stewed with exotic spices and grated ginger.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",102804
"105418","Rubbery, baked aromas of raspberry come with a minerally note of children's vitamins. This has a creamy mouthfeel but little stuffing or backing.

"30886","Baked black cherry meets with nutmeg, clove and dried ginger on the very inviting nose of this bottling by Adam Lee. A sizzling acidity greets the palate, as do muscular tannins, with flavors of dark-red fruit, allspice and gingerbread falling into place.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",30886
"86750","The flagship estate of the Vigouroux family, this medieval castle on a hill is also a hotel. The vineyard produces powerful wines like this, packed with dusty tannins and with dark berry fruits and fine concentration. It is a wine to age, drink from 2020.","Red","Malbec","France",86750
"50466","This fresh, pure value red cranks out raspberry and boysenberry aromas in front of a crisp, tight palate. Ripe, quick-hitting flavors of red-berry fruits and toasty smoke finish zesty, with a lasting note of pie cherry.","Red","Mencía","Spain",50466
"36047","Tight and dry in tannins now, with an astringent mouthfeel that feels like sandpaper. So is it an ager? It's dry and balanced and rich in blackberries, cherries and currants, so it might be. Try after 2012, if you're the gambling type.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",36047
"41007","This is a softly sophisticated Cabernet that will please fans of the variety who want a wine that's a little earthier than your riper Napa Valley versions. It has herb and tobacco flavors, but there's also a delicious sunburst of sweetly ripe cherries right in the middle that lasts through the finish. Should develop over the next 7–8 years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",41007
"47192","Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity. Flavors of baked berry fruits are minerally at the core, while the finish is smooth, mature and steady, with lasting purity. Drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",47192

"11062","This blend of 50% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is quite a delicious and full package. The nose is pretty yet also dense and brawny, with aromas of baked black plum, wild blackberry, leather, sagebrush and lightly roasted coffee. There is lots of chalky texture on the palate and a pointed acidity, presenting exotic flavors of plum, mulberry, pepper spice and a touch of nutmeg.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",11062
"43178","This peppery, fruit-flavored wine has a ripe character and wild strawberry flavors. Drink this full, spicy wine now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",43178
"7182","Savory aromas of bay leaf and fennel pair with mushrooms and freshly turned dirt on this single-vineyard wine. The flavors are also more earthy than fruity, with oregano, thyme, tea, espresso, cola and only a hint of cranberry. The tannins are strong, so this will last for a few years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",7182
"100754","After spending 20 months in a mix of French and American oak, this full-bodied Shiraz is imbued with seductive notes of vanilla and baking spices. But there are also plenty of plummy fruit and savory undertones of espresso and roasted meat. It's supple enough to drink now, although it should last through at least 2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",100754
"17089","At first, this comes across as raisiny and maybe even overripe. With airing, it settles on baked black fruits and density. Flavors of ripe berry, baked plum and raisin are undeniably chunky and deep, while oak and prune take over on the finish. Drink sooner rather than later.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",17089
"9593","This medium-bodied red offers ample cherry and leather flavors but not much richness or depth. It's clean on the finish, with modest tannins and mouthwatering fruit.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",9593

Brawny, round and delicious, this is already approachable. Drink through 2017.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",84254
"24661","This wine is dark and inky in color. Nearly impenetrable at first on the nose, this reluctantly giving up hints of plum, cocoa and earth. The plum-pudding palate is dense and weighty, with savory overtones. Give it until 2018 or 2020 to unclench and brighten up.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",24661
"106449","This is a big blush wine with bold orange and strawberry fruit flavors. There's a honeyed edge to the palate, but it's vital with acidity. Great with Mediterranean fish stew or paella, or on the beach with cold cuts.","Rosé","Rosé","US",106449
"3353","Vibrant aromas of black plum, cassis, dried leather, licorice and herb lead to full, sweet, soft-feeling dark fruit flavors that linger.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",3353
"15103","Stylistically, this Pinot is right in the middle of the big, blowsy style and the more austere, low-alcohol style. It's balanced, dry and rich in cherry and raspberry-pie flavors, with an opulent overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Drink now–2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",15103
"88528","The wine is a little candied, with stewed cherry, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors, set off with good acidity. It's also a bit hot and oaky. Hard to see it aging, so drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88528
"23909","This single-vineyard Barolo is fragrant, with violet, leather and underbrush aromas. The palate shows bright red-cherry flavors and layers of cinnamon and other spices. Despite the forward nature of the vintage, this actually needs a few more years to open up.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",23909
"87545","Bread, apple cider and yeasty complexity grace the nose on this Brut Nature. A smooth palate is now mature, ready and doesn't scrape or scour. Dry stone-fruit flavors blend with apple notes in front of a bready, toasty finish that has seltzer-like crispness. Drink through 2020.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",87545
"73792","This light-bodied wine made from Grenache has a deep pink color with a hint of orange, light cherry and raspberry aromas and a touch of spicy-earthy flavor among the fruit nuances. It feels very smooth and easy in the mouth and has a soft finish.","Rosé","Rosé","US",73792
"85981","This hearty blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Cabernet Franc, 24% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot offers blackberry, smoked beef, vanilla, cola and anise scents on the nose. The palate is tightly wound, its boysenberry fruit and dark soil minerality leading into a finish laced with licorice spice.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",85981
"36610","This is a soft, well-integrated wine with a full-throttle backbone of cedar and cranberry that drinks easily and is ready for the table. Priced attractively, it offers value for the quality and broad appeal.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",36610

"101331","Dominated by Tinta Roriz, this smooth, red fruited wine is ripe on the palate. Tannins come from wood aging as much as the ripe strawberry and red currant fruits. It has a smoky finish that is laced with acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",101331
"63664","John Shaw and Lisa Cuevas Shaw run this boutique-sized, Bordeaux-minded winery, which offers this Sauvignon Blanc alongside their higher priced reds. This wine starts with lemongrass, crushed rock and white flower aromas, then indulges in some tropical guava on the palate, which is very soft and full.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",63664
"62218","For a Petit-Chablis, this has plenty of firm, tight structure. While the fruit is light, it is based on a texture of sweet caramel and plums, freshened with acidity. The finish is rich and soft.","White","Chardonnay","France",62218
"57212","This rusty colored Pinot opens with aromas of cherry candy and chocolate. There's power to the palate, but also abruptness. Dry, spicy flavors of chocolate, raspberry and orange rind carry over to a direct finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Argentina",57212
"80242","Tastes overworked, with superripe pineapple and tropical fruit flavors and very strong, new oaky notes of caramel and toast. There's a buttered popcorn quality, like something from the movie theatre.","White","Chardonnay","US",80242

"101277","Concentrated and sweet, with aromas of raisin and cassis that lead onto an intense, syrupy palate, with salty berry, brown sugar and fudge flavors.

"9566","This big, lusty Zin has high alcohol, which gives it a full bodied, glyceriney sweetness, as well as some heat. It's ripe in blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Great to drink now with barbecue.","Red","Zinfandel","US",9566
"47069","Maucamps is situated in Macau, just south of Margaux, giving it a stylish character. It has weight, of course, but this is given perspective by the structured black fruits and supporting tannin. A dry core will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",47069
"63638","The fruit comes from the cool climate Den Hoed vineyard. It was barrel fermented in neutral French oak Burgundy barrels, yielding a racy, razor-sharp, spicy, detailed, delicious wine. Lovely fruit is highlighted with peppery notes, running the gamut from cucumber on through to tropical flavors. Ripe, full, lingering.","White","Viognier","US",63638

"90007","A solid example of the variety, with complex red and black fruits mixing it up with additional grace notes of coffee, sweet spice, toast and licorice. It's a balanced effort, with rather delicate tannins, and a finish that quits just a little early.","Red","Syrah","US",90007
"18250","This cuvée has the prettiest aromatics of the entire 2012 lineup, highlighted with rose petals and spice. Apples and cranberries are the fruit components, amped up with stiff acidity. It finishes with a faint touch of chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18250

"97386","The use of 75% new oak applies a thick coating of vanilla over the fruit, which nonetheless is in plentiful supply, sweet, sappy and delicious. Immense black cherry and cassis turns a bit liquorous in the mouth, with streaks of tobacco, lots of vanilla and some finishing heat.","Red","Syrah","US",97386
"56550","A hugely ripe, wood-dominated Chardonnay, which had 11 months of wood aging. Vanilla and tropical fruit aromas lead to a palate with almonds, apples and cream flavors, layers of spice and a rich, soft aftertaste.","White","Chardonnay","Italy",56550
"69614","Water Wheel wines consistently deliver quality and value. The winery's 2007 Shiraz is made in a decadently supple, drink-now style with enough cocoa and mocha overtones to bring chocolate cake to mind. There's some cedar and spice complexity as well. Drink now-2013.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",69614
"94271","Grown on dense chalky soil, this concentrated, tight and mineral wine is also rich. Pure acidity and rich apple flavors are cut by a nervy streak and textured with lively spice. This wine is worth aging, so drink from late 2017.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",94271
"5558","Power is the best word to describe this solidly structured wine. Its tannins are dominant at this stage, giving a dense, dry core to the rich black fruits and bitter chocolate. The final adds on appealing black currant perfumes.","Red","Red Blend","France",5558

Broad, deep and immensely pleasurable.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103639
"93729","The Sauvignon Blanc style here has gotten more refined and restrained in recent years, less opulent and flamboyant. This hints at snow pea and struck flint on the nose, then delivers primarily grapefruit on the palate, ending on a slightly austere note.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",93729
"71567","Black color shows a depth of extraction in this earthy, burly wine. It reveals layers of leather, cedar and tobacco most, with a billowy tannin structure providing a foundation for additional elements of meaty black fruit and graphite.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71567
"16724","Given the great potential of the 2015 vintage, it's reassuring to see that some big brands have scored successes like this.

"100926","Although this wine is described as slightly off dry by the winery, for most palates it would be perfectly dry, though just slightly rounded off to eliminate any suggestion of sourness. Lychee, pineapple and grapefruit flavors abound, underscored with refreshing minerality. That vivid acidity carries through a resonant, lively finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","Canada",100926
"99832","This small Premier Cru vineyard is wholly owned by the Devillard family. It is a rich wine, boasting layers of beautiful jammy red fruits and just the lightest touch of wood.

"51264","No information on blending was provided by the winery; this does not show typical character of truly varietal Grenache. Rather, it falls into the category of mutt wine; a ready-to-drink, nondescript red with a stiff, herbal, earthy finish.","Red","Grenache","US",51264
"45558","Black-fruit aromas blend nicely into chocolate, vanilla and savory fig scents on the nose of this Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend. A dense, well-structured palate holds savory flavors of plum and baked berry fruits. A complex finish that revolves around mild oak and salty fruit flavors is lasting. Drink through 2023.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Argentina",45558
"17873","Coming from the more northerly parts of Burgundy, this is cool Chardonnay, with steel and minerality. It is firmly textured, its apple and quince flavors coming with a more citrus element.","White","Chardonnay","France",17873
"39754","White-fruit aromas of pear, apple and melon are decent. This feels round but not exact. Chunky flavors of apple and melon are low on zest and freshness, while the finish feels heavy and is salty in taste.","White","Chardonnay","Spain",39754
"32627","This wine is a blend of McKinley Springs and Alder Ridge fruit. Coffee and cherry aromas lead to restrained cranberry flavors, with the tannins bringing some dryness and grit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",32627
"88934","This is a rich, powerful and wood-aged wine that shows fine balance between its ripe red fruits and solid, chunky tannins. The wood rounds out the rich texture and gives character to the full, juicy finish.","Red","Gamay","France",88934
"94298","One of the better Sangioveses out there, although it's more like Zinfandel than the great grape of Tuscany. It's robust in rustic tannins, with ripe, extracted flavors of wild forest berries, cola, licorice, beef teriaki and sandalwood. At its best now.","Red","Sangiovese","US",94298
"61476","This refreshing sparkling wine made mostly from Pinot Noir grapes has a light-gold color and slightly toasted or earthy aromas. It feels lively and frothy in texture, nicely crisp in balance, and medium bodied. Ripe apple and peach flavors emerge with each sip.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",61476
"92255","This pale pink rosé offers a reasonably complex array of aromas and flavors, ranging from anise to wet stone, and cracked pepper to wild strawberries. It's medium to full in body, with a finish that resonates of wet stone and spice. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",92255
"16664","This rich, dark take on the cool-climate vineyard delivers all the great Syrah components. Lavish cooked beef, fudge, loam and mint aromas accent its black currant and blueberry base. The palate is coated with soft, polished tannins that present savory beef and black currant flavors, steeped in peppercorn and lavender.","Red","Syrah","US",16664
"38750","Nine years in tirage gives this 75% Chardonnay/25% Pinot Noir sparkler a deeply golden hue as well as aged aromas of hazelnut, caramelized apple and fermenting stone fruit. Apple juice dominates the oxidized flavor profile, with heavy duty yeast and lemon pith along for the curious, intriguing ride.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",38750
"88369","Mouthwatering acidity and berry freshness mark this muscular young Pinot Noir. It's gritty in tannins and brilliant in acids, with subtle flavors of sour red cherries, persimmons and cola, as well as a mushroomy earthiness to which oak adds exotic sandalwood notes. Very dry and fine, complex and provocative, a wine to let warm in the glass as it changes by the minute. Drink now–2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88369
"21076","This Riesling is right on the borderline of dry/off-dry (just under 1% RS). The fruit, from cooler Willamette Valley vineyard sites, has been fermented in stainless steel and aged on its lees, yielding a wine that is thick, almost meaty. It's as sappy as a fresh peach, and finishes with crisp peach-skin phenolics. All-in-all this is a surprising wine, neither simple nor plain, but full-flavored in the comforting style that seems almost to have vanished from the Northwest.","White","Riesling","US",21076
"83523","Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.","White","Albariño","US",83523
"72341","Very slight notes of reduction still cling to the wine, but a swirl or two reveals crisp, crunchy red cherry. On the slender palate the fruit is pleasantly tart and even more crunchy but wonderfully vibrant. A refreshing, easy-drinking red. Drink soon.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",72341
"103640","Gorgeous, elegant and ageworthy. With a softly tannic structure, it's drinkable now, but should age and gain complexity for 10 years. Dry and smooth, it has complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, red licorice, cola and oak. Give it some time to breathe. Now–2017.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",103640
"46610","Aromas of blackberry, cherry preserves, white chocolate and a hint of green pepper prepare the taste buds for flavors of forest-fruit, smoked pork, black pepper, violet and almond blossom. A trio of fruit, savory tones and spice travels across the palate on a layer of smooth tannins, leading to a smoky finish.","Red","Shiraz","India",46610
"33419","Properly structured, this is a solid wine. Great swathes of plum fruits are partnered with firm tannins. It is dark and firm, with a dense character. Touches of chocolate and roasted coffee go with the rich plums. Drink from 2015.","Red","Gamay","France",33419
"44025","Earthy aromas of cola, coffee and saucy plum lead to a palate that at first seems loud and acidic but which comes around. Plum and berry flavors are accented by oaky vanilla and citrus peel, while this is bright on the finish due to lasting acidity. Drink through 2023.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",44025
"24867","Bottled unfiltered, this wine shows some carbonic tendencies, a wildness of strawberry punch and sharp acidity. Light bodied and restrained, it is softly layered and subtle in oak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",24867
"46509","Made in the richly extracted, super-oaky and sweetly soft style of modern Napa Cabs, this wine trades structure for sheer deliciousness. The flavors are wildly extravagant: blackberries, blueberries, cherries, pie crust, cola, exotic spices, smoke, graphite. But what the wine really needs is greater architecture and more definitive dryness. Drink now–2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",46509
"48436","Always a wine that shows a powerful oak influence, this new Indian Wells seems soaked in buttered popcorn flavor. The finish comes out a little bitter, with little fruit flavor to round it out.","White","Chardonnay","US",48436
"93053","Layers of mushroom, savory spice, and earth lend depth and complexity to luscious red raspberry and cherry flavors in this complex, standout Cabernet Franc. Tart cranberry cuts through the supple and silky palate, leading to a cool, mineral finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",93053
"11410","Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",11410
"38449","Oaky walnut aromas kick off this medium-bodied wine, opening into warmer pear and apple flavors on the palate. It feels dry and reasonably rich in texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",38449
"69059","Structured and delicious, this opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, leather rose petal and a balsamic note. The juicy palate doles out raspberry compote, ripe red cherry, cinnamon and a sprinkling of white pepper. Firm velvety tannins provide the framework while a licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2019–2025.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",69059
"63713","This impressive Chardonnay from a small Livermore Valley producer is on the austere side of Chardonnay, with notes of just-ripe pear, tiny hints of wet stone, a nice, nutty finish and enough body to go with a wealth of foods. Good balance too.","White","Chardonnay","US",63713
"26609","At this stage, this is very closed, very tight, giving little. But it is possible to discern that this is going to be a beautiful wine. There are flavors of sweet raisins and the fruit has a new world richness, but the structure of dry tannins is always present. It looks as though it has a good, long life.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26609
"90185","As befits a reserve-level wine, this is big, bold, rich and full-flavored. It amplifies the ripe apple and peach fruit, and slathers it in buttery caramel and sweet spice. Drink now through 2020.","White","Chardonnay","US",90185
"49093","Smoked meat, rubber, char and leathery darkness are all good aromas for a value-priced Malbec. The palate is adequately deep and lush, and it maintains pulse and verve while delivering robust flavors of black fruits and herbs. Meaty and pretty long on the finish, and very good Malbec for the money.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",49093
"40725","Raspberry, medicine cabinet and Red Vine aromas lead to sweet, succulent fruit flavors and a tart finish. Good things are going on but the wine could use more structure to back it all up.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",40725
"12837","This concentrated and lush wine opens with notes of black cherry and berry, with supporting accents of baking spice, toast and cigar tobacco. It's velvety and filling, but with good grip and a solid structure to keep the palate focused and centered. An herbal accent lingers through the finish; drink now-2018.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",12837
"20138","A distinctive mineral vein runs through this crisp white wine from the Cusumano brothers of Sicily. Made in Alcamo, in the southwest part of the Mediterranean island, the wine is fresh, easygoing and offers a touch of piquant spice on the close.","White","White Blend","Italy",20138
"77192","This is the inaugural release from this winery that focuses on the expression of Cabernet in a different site each year. It's dazzling, rich with blackberry, black currant, herb, dark chocolate and barrel spices. The full-bodied flavors are candy-bar sweet with some chewy tannic heft that bodes well for its potential in the cellar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",77192
"70287","This is a solid example of a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc: Bright and fruit forward with attractive stone fruit and lemon verbena notes on the nose, while lemon-lime popsicle carries on the palate. The body shows some weight and a slippery texture to keep all that acid in check.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",70287
"39817","With 30% new oak, the wood stands out, giving the wine vanilla and buttered toast notes. Crisp acidity kicks in right away, giving sour candy flavors of pineapples and lemons, while the underlying Arroyo Grande terroir gives this Chard a minerally tug. Dry and elegant, it's a wine to drink now, with decanting.","White","Chardonnay","US",39817
"89893","A blend of Nero d'Avola and other Sicilian grapes, this features fruity aromas of dark berry and a whiff of graphite. The savory, straightforward palate offers up ripe black cherry and juicy blackberry, with notes of ground white pepper in the background. Soft tannins provide easy-drinking texture.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",89893
"67577","Though not as concentrated as many examples from this AVA, this brings identifiable Pinot Noir character, albeit in a rather thin, austere style. Pale cranberry and pomegranate fruit is matched to tart acidity and a veneer of herb.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67577
"29381","Don't be fooled by the Washington label. This is Yakima Valley fruit coming from a site next to esteemed Boushey Vineyard. Aromas of fresh herbs, brown stems, red fruit, graphite, bacon fat and orange peel lead to a mouthful of generous fruit flavors. The finish persists.","Red","Syrah","US",29381
"96475","This screwcap red blend from northern Italy offers a fantastic little package at a very attractive low price. Pristine aromas of red berry and white cherry are offset by subtle shadings of sweet spice and crushed mineral. The wine drinks very well.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",96475
"4630","With its briary flavors of fresh-picked mountain berries and exotic clove, nutmeg and pepper spices, this Zin defines a more elegant Foothills approach to the variety. The texture is light and silky, not at all heavy, a supple, polished wine of great appeal.","Red","Zinfandel","US",4630
"81435","A blend of Red Willow Merlot (61%) and Angela's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers savory aromas of herbs, nori and peanut shells. The palate shows good concentration to the sweet coffee and cherry flavors that display a supple feel and are backed by lightly chewy tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",81435

"83190","Simple but fresh, with mild lemon and melon aromas propped up by a kiss of oak. The palate is plump, fruity and melony, with toasted corn and baked apple nuances. Comes together well.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",83190
"105926","This is one of the stars of the vintage in 2010; the Conner Lee fruit is rich and fully ripe, with a pleasingly candied aspect. Yet it remains lively with bracing acids, citrus and apple, and highlights of toasted nuts and caramel. A big, grin-inducing wine that is virtually irresistible.","White","Chardonnay","US",105926
"46824","Right out of the bottle, this wine is tannic and closed. After a while in the glass, it starts to soften, showing mushroom, cola, pomegranate and raspberry flavors, but it's still resistant. Give it until 2018, and it should gradually unfold for another few years afterward.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46824
"18535","This wine is complex and deep in flavors, traditional in style and simply gorgeous to sip and savor. It's dry in style, good and tannic in texture, lightly spiced with cedar and cinnamon and grounded in concentrated raspberry and dark cherry flavors.","Red","Primitivo","US",18535
"74921","This interesting and complex rosé—made from 65% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 7% Vermentino and 3% Viognier—is aged for six months in oak. The resulting wine is a cellar-worthy selection that boasts upfront notes of toasted spice, lemon custard, vanilla bean and ripe red berries. The oak influence currently dominates the plush and generous palate, while the creamy texture and lingering smoky spice are enticingly decadent. While you can enjoy this rich wine now, give it some time for the oak to mellow and further integrate with the fruit; drink now–2017.","Rosé","Rosé","France",74921
"730","This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now–2018.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",730
"61986","Café au lait, herb, cherry and wood-spice aromas lead to elegantly styled fruit and barrel flavors. It shows a lovely sense of styling.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",61986
"1746","This shows the rich density of Merlot in 2009, giving a solid structure, with dried fruit and red berry flavors and a concentrated line of tannins. Big and dense, this is ready to age.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",1746
"2251","A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout. A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","France",2251
"82798","The winery calls this a Super-Tuscan blend, though the inclusion of 38% Carmenère might have some Italian vintners scratching their heads. The rest is mostly Sangiovese, with bits of Syrah and Cabernet as well. Juicy citrus and purple berries, some pomegranate and dark chocolate can be found, along with the green bean, stemmy flavors of Carmenère.","Red","Red Blend","US",82798
"84945","Rose petal, baked strawberry, sarsaparilla and baking spice aromas show strongly on the indulgent nose of this bottling. It's floral, full-bodied and multi-layered on the palate, with baked red cherry and cranberry flavors swathed in cinnamon, hibiscus and anise spice.","Red","Grenache","US",84945

"87","An easy-drinking blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of red berry, toast, herb and roasted coffee bean. The soft palate offers black cherry, mocha and a hint of coffee alongside bright acidity and silky tannins. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",87
"35940","This lightly wood-aged wine, from an estate that has only changed hands three times in 400 years, is crisp, tight and very young. It has fine potential for the future. There are elegant fruits, spice and intense acidity that needs to soften. Produced from selected high-altitude parcels, the wine is balanced between the tangy texture and mineral fruitiness. Drink from early 2018.","Rosé","Rosé","France",35940
"99804","An interesting Merlot that shows a huge improvement over the '02 and '03, possibly because the vintage was warmer and the fruit got ripe. The winery still has work to do on this bottling, but the '04 is tannic and rich, and shows the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors you want in an ultrapremium Merlot.","Red","Merlot","US",99804
"104149","Candied berry aromas are jumpy, herbal and foxy. This has a raw pinched mouthfeel and minty herbal plum and berry flavors. On the finish, green elements rise to the level of herbaceous.","Red","Merlot","Chile",104149
"20631","Dark, crusty aromas of spice cherry, mint and black olive lead to a lively, zesty palate with strong acidity and oaky, minty berry flavors mixed with notes of carob and black pepper. Olive, herbs and blackberry flavors work the finish, which brings kick and mild heat.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",20631
"53122","A beautiful Chardonnay, creamy, dry and elegant. There's a tangy minerality underlying the rich tropical fruit, apple, pear and buttered toast flavors. This is an elegant and sophisticated wine from the Carneros region.","White","Chardonnay","US",53122
"63062","RWT (unromantically derived from “Red Wine Trial”) is 100% Barossa Valley Shiraz, aged in 100% French oak. In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla. It's long, subtle and complex on the finish—a stunning effort. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2030 or so.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",63062
"67384","Light aromas offer notes of apple and pear. The palate of thhis wine is cleanly made, showing no obvious new-oak impact. It's a straight-down-the-fairway interpretation of this variety.","White","Chardonnay","US",67384
"5590","This dark, dry, tannic wine is rich in blackberries and cherries, with earthy notes of mushrooms and herbs. It's pretty tight and astringent now, but should soften over the next 5–6 years. The blend is Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional and Souzão.","Red","Red Blend","US",5590
"13736","Classic Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, menthol, pressed rose, perfumed wild berry and chopped aromatic herb continuously lift out of the glass. The luminous, delicious palate delivers layers of succulent Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and star anise set against a backbone of youthfully assertive but fine tannins. Bright acidity gives it wonderful balance while a note of pipe tobacco graces the lingering finish. Drink 2028–2048.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",13736

"44664","This riserva shows ripe aromas of plum and wild cherry accompanied by notes of underbrush and oak. It has lush black-cherry, raspberry, mint and cinnamon flavors, and hints of vanilla and chocolate. It's enjoyable now, thanks to the soft, round tannins and easygoing palate.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",44664
"79615","Old Zinfandel plant material from Santa Cruz was propagated in one of the most inhospitable sites for grapes on Catalina Island to make this wine—a fascinating story for any history lover. The wine itself is somewhat simple, with generic red fruit, turned loam and black pepper scents, followed by cranberry, white pepper and crushed rock flavors on the palate.","Red","Zinfandel","US",79615
"92874","Subdued aromas of toast and red berry lead the way on this easygoing red. The simple, rather diluted palate offers sour cherry and a hint of spice alongside soft, fleeting tannins and fresh acidity.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",92874

"55057","This is a ripe, wood-aged wine that shows the richer side of Meursault. It's generous with ripe yellow fruits, but balanced and complemented by crisp acidity and hints of toastiness. A fine wine with impeccable structure, it will age well, so drink from 2015.","White","Chardonnay","France",55057
"22638","Rich, ripe blackberry preserves, vanilla and toasted coconut flavors make this full bodied Cab Franc feel deliciously warm and generous in style. A sharp whiff of graphite and lean acidity on the midpalate add structure and balance on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",22638
"26529","Enticing scents of apple, chamomile flower and peach float out of the glass and carry over to the smooth, concentrated palate along with lemon drop, mineral and a hint of vanilla. It's loaded with finesse while careful oak aging lends complexity. Drink through 2021.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",26529
"39443","Riper notions of yellow plum and melon mingle with Grüner's attractive freshness, here expressed by lemon and lime zest flavors. The palate adds extra verve with a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. This is a taut, clean, super-fruited textbook example of freshness with tons of verve.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",39443
"39331","The 2008 Sineann Pinots are an elegant, refined group of wines, more expressive of Burgundian varietal character than any in memory, and the Resonance, as usual, is among the best. It has a vibrant purity to the fruit that rings true and long through mixed red berries, vivid acids, streaks of iron and earth, and sails on into a detailed and seamless finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",39331
"101233","This is a rich, densely tannic wine with dark-hued blackberry fruits and ripe acidity. It is concentrated, still very firm while just beginning to show its full-bodied character. Wait until 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",101233
"51106","This vineyard designate made from 777 clone Pinot Noir was fermented in single-use barrels and aged in neutral wood.

"106351","A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa.","Red","Red Blend","US",106351
"54567","This is a softly layered wine with just the right amount of tension to give credence to a lifted minerality, accented by well-crafted clove and baked strawberry. The finish is spicy in more clove and nutmeg.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54567
"88145","There's a very appealing sense of hickory smoke to this wine, which comes from a block planted in 1973 on this historic vineyard. Red cherry, mulberry, sweet sage and cola also play into the nose. Rich sandalwood flavors show on the palate, as does cedar, thyme, smoke and tart berry elements.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",88145

"35229","One of the many properties in Moulis with Poujeaux in its name, this estate has produced a classic, elegant wine, its Cabernet Sauvignon element providing a delicious black currant flavor, rounded out by the Merlot. Firm tannins still point the wine in the direction of aging, so give it four years and more.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",35229
"59255","Dedicated to the vineyard crews, this wine features a dynamic nose that blends dried black cherries, slightly sour plum fruit and a bit of tar. The palate also picks up the dried cherries and plums, along with blackberry and dark-chocolate flavors.","Red","Primitivo","US",59255
"41400","The original Dagueneau domaine, Berthiers has produced a rich, warm wine, full in style, layering its crisp lemon acidity with ripe pear flavors. As often with Pouilly Fumé, it's a wine that needs aging, so drink from 2014.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",41400
"92803","Leathery blackberry, vanilla and tobacco aromas include a gritty burnt note that's not entirely welcome. This feels full and oaky, with good balance. Oak-based flavors of vanilla and mocha sit atop black-fruit notes, while this is balanced yet tannic on the finish, with a lingering flavor of vanilla. Drink from 2018–2023.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",92803

"55537","Plenty of toast and menthol aromas let you know this has seen new oak; it also masks some pretty black-cherry notes that you now have to ferret out.

Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",73779
"23005","Smoky and meaty, this is aggressively savory in style, but really evolves with air to show a gentler, raspberry-fruited side accented by dried spices. It's medium- to full- bodied, with a slightly creamy texture and silky, mouthwatering finish. Terrific cool-climate Shiraz.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",23005
"19951","This dark, exotic blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is impressive given that 2008 wasn't a good year in Spain. This shows integrated oak, graphite and inky aromas in front of a full, balanced palate that's home to berry flavors, schisty minerality and mocha accents. A generous finish with plum and berry flavors as well as licorice is the right ending. Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",19951

"28960","This wine demonstrates Viognier's exotic side, with flavors of tropical fruit, tangerine, white flower, vanilla, honey and spice. Despite the richness, it's dry and the acidity is mouthwatering. Don't serve this too cold, and pair it with Asian fare that's slightly sweet.","White","Viognier","US",28960

Similar flavors show on the palate, from mace to dried ginger. A bright red-cherry and cranberry character lifts the sip, as does the juniper and forest-floor finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70071
"63154","Dark extraction and concentrated fruit set the stage. The wine has soft touches of blackberry fruit and plump cherry that are inevitably followed by tight tannins and sharp acidity. This is an astringent, firm wine that should be paired with fatty foods.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",63154
"106253","Black licorice, raisiny fruit and a little sweaty oak are the name of the game here. Acidity on the palate is searing and tannins are soft, not giving quite enough support. The fruit is on the sour side and the oak a little bitter.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",106253
"45975","The aromas are bright, with notes of fresh herb, red cherry, Red Vines, orange peel and barrel spice. The palate shows a pleasing sense of concentration and richness, with light meaty notes on the finish.","Red","Merlot","US",45975
"92707","Here's a rich, soft, gently approachable red wine for big beef stews and barbecue. Full-bodied and dry, it's power-packed in blackberries, currants, carob, violets and raisins, with a coat of sweet smoky oak. Drink now through 2010.","Red","Red Blend","US",92707
"4455","A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of oak, rubber and unusual sensations that recall petrol. There's more oak than fruit on the palate, delivering toasted oak, espresso, vanilla and coffee alongside hints of black cherry. It closes on an astringent, tannic note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",4455
"26990","Deep but not showy aromas of velvety lilacs, concentrated blackberry and river rocks pop on the nose of this blend of 42% Syrah, 37% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 7% Counoise. Rounded purple-fruit flavors mesh with a silky, earthy texture on the palate, with olallieberry, caramel and a slow rising acidity.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",26990
"73235","Light, fresh and easy wine, with pear and green apple fruit and a deft, soft texture. Totally ready to drink.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",73235
"88816","The wine has plenty of fruit, the right layers of tannin. And yet it seems one-dimensional—something that can happen with Touriga Nacional. The depth and complexity found in previous vintages of this wine are missing. So you get bold black fruits and a stylish structure in a wine that is almost ready to drink.","Red","Touriga Nacional","Portugal",88816
"7775","Inexpensive, this Zin is quite ripe and quite oaky, a big mouthful of wine ready to enjoy now.","Red","Zinfandel","US",7775
"58122","This medium-weight wine starts off with wonderfully pure, expressive aromas of ripe passion fruit. On the palate, it's a bit prickly and leafy at first, like tomato stalks or nettle leaves. It then settles back down into tropical fruit on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",58122
"45409","Soft fruit and lightly spicy, the wine has a touch of acidity, lychee and ripe apple flavors. It is ready to drink, a full and gently rich wine.","White","Pinot Gris","France",45409
"73968","Dusty white-fruit aromas are generic. This fuller-bodied Chenin Blanc tastes of apple and acid-driven salt and brine.","White","Chenin Blanc","Argentina",73968
"68546","Rich, ripe yellow cherries and honeysuckle waft from this luxuriously honeyed off-dry Riesling. A sweet tangerine flavor is densely concentrated on the palate, yet the wine is sprightly and zesty in mouthfeel. An elegant floral spray extends the long, lingering finish.","White","Riesling","US",68546
"47452","Sourced from a single block at the top of the vineyard, this seems thin, especially for such a rich vintage. It's characterized by cola and root beer flavors, along with details of fennel, iron and earth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47452
"84291","Chunky and murky on the nose, with melon and papaya aromas. Feels round but light in the center, with vanilla, pear and melon flavors. Fleshy and simple on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",84291
"29188","Structured yet refined, this opens with lovely, understated aromas of red berry, violet and a whiff of exotic spice. The palate is more expressive, delivering mouthwatering black cherry, vanilla, mocha and black pepper alongside a firmly tannic backbone. It closes on a licorice note. Drink 2016–2021.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",29188
"85508","Generous and opulent, this is a wine that has both fine perfume and ripe black-fruit flavors. There is a deliciously juicy element to the wine, yet it's balanced with ample acidity. With its attractive, herbal edge, this is a wine that can age. Drink from 2016.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",85508
"40625","Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",40625
"104459","The aromas start out reticent, with notes of black licorice, kirsch, black olive and earth along with some barrel notes. The flavors are bold, full and palate coating, and are capped off by a lengthy finish.","Red","Syrah","US",104459
"30913","Good and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors. Suffers a bit from arch acidity, but a nice steak should balance it. The delicious flavors include blackberry and cherry jam, licorice, charred meat and a hefty dose of freshly crushed black pepper.","Red","Syrah","US",30913
"43463","Shows varietally correct grassiness and herbal notes on the nose, followed by round, honeyed fruit flavors that turn racy and grapefruity on the finish. Suitable as an apéritif or paired with slightly weighty fish dishes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Australia",43463
"23538","Nearly opaque in color, the wine offers slight blackberry on the nose with a touch of pie crust. Despite some berry persistence, the flavors lean toward the savory side of Cab, with violet, tobacco and wild game.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",23538
"85333","In recent years, with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm, Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile, this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry, cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis, cherry, plum, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced, with excellent natural acidity. Best from 2008–2012.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",85333
"103853","A dark berry aroma comes with a distinct whiff of green. On the palate, the wine feels crisp and clampy, while the flavors of spicy, herbal plum and berry teeter on the edge of being green. It tastes briary and like tomato sauce on the finish.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",103853
"51204","This is VM's big single-vineyard Pinot, but it's already very approachable. Savory overtones of damp earth, outline modest pie-cherry notes that seem somewhat delicate. Enjoy this medium-bodied wine over the next few years for its silky texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",51204
"33480","Aromas of dish soap and kitchen cleanser don't stink but they aren't impressive, either. Round on the palate, with low acidity, this tastes of chunky, mealy apple and finishes tired and briny.","White","Verdejo","Spain",33480
"42055","Fermentation in wood has given this wine a rich spicy character that contrasts with the honey and lemon fruitiness and the mineral texture. Aromatic and perfumed with summer blossoms, it is ready to drink.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",42055
"15764","A ton of oak aromas hit with force: there's butterscotch, mocha and caramel leading the pack. The palate is pretty jacked up on sweet cassis and berry flavors, so don't expect too much in the way of elegance. Then more butter and vanilla floods the finish. Reasonably good but not as harmonious as the 2005.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",15764
"17564","This is an open delicious wine, full of red-cherry and red-currant fruit with a touch of minerality to add texture. Some wood aging has smoothed out the crisp fruit and added vanilla to the mix. Drink this ripe wine from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",17564
"100741","A signature wine for Girardin, this is powerful and rich, with apricot, quince and green plum fruits that are layered within the taut texture. A toast note rounds out this complex, ageworthy wine.","White","Chardonnay","France",100741
"36103","This is Wine Guerilla's most costly Zin and also their best, most Zinny one. It's textbook Dry Creek Valley. Dry, rich and high in alcohol but balanced, it offers waves of grilled wild berry, mocha, red licorice, raisin, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors, wrapped into gorgeous tannins.","Red","Zinfandel","US",36103
"86574","This bottling by the Scheid family of wines is a solidly reliable deal, with dried black cherries, beef jerky, leather and a bit of tar on the nose. Crushed, dried herbs show on the palate, along with roasted pork and more black cherry, proving both juicy and meaty, with a slate-driven minerality.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",86574
"38120","A salmon-colored wine, very fresh, with a full palate that carries flavors of strawberries and red currants. The wine is dry, but with the smooth caramel texture, it seems sweeter and softer.","Rosé","Rosé","Portugal",38120
"92083","A stalky, almost weedy nose offers burnt aromas of red fruits and oak. This feels tannic and crisp, while flavors of roasted berry fruits are earthy. The finish feels right but tastes herbal and saucy. This is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",92083
"40261","Starts off with fresh but simple aromas of apple wedges, greens and limes, but shows altogether more interesting flavors—the apple and citrus are complemented by hints of oil or shale. Turns minerally on the finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",40261
"102969","Nuanced aromatics of smoky red cherry and the slightest tinge of elderberry promise joy. The palate is supported well by unobtrusive, well-handled oak and comes together as an elegant, velvety whole. Edges of spice fizz around the central backbone of acidity. This is lovely and slender, beautiful now but with the structure and stuffing to age. The lingering aftertaste speaks of ripe fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",102969
"35961","This structured wine also has already delicious red fruit flavors. The core of tannins is surrounded by this cushion of ripe fruits, layered with acidity and altogether enticing now. Drink now, although the wine will certainly age.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",35961
"17749","Quite ripe on the nose, such that raisin and sweetness are front and center. Saturated in the mouth, but as a whole it's a bit flabby and, for the most part, it's neither here nor there. Flavors of plum and berry tilt to the dark side, while the finish is short but inoffensive.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",17749
"40875","A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Viognier and Petite Sirah, this is dry, brisk and straightforward, with red currant and pepper flavors. Drink it now with roasted or grilled meats and stews.","Red","Red Blend","US",40875
"8635","A wonderful Riesling, so polished and pretty. It was grown on the cooler western side of the Santa Lucia Mountains, where the chilly climate has kept refreshing acidity while letting the grapes fully ripen. Showing flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, yellow apricots, peaches, wildflowers and slate, it finishes with a long, fine taste of honey.","White","Riesling","US",8635
"51079","Here's a pure expression of the hearty Montepulciano grape with bright berry flavors, thick extraction and a chewy, succulent texture. It's sticky and jammy-sweet in places and thick on the palate.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",51079
"41675","Made in robust style, then blended with 11% Petite Sirah and smaller amounts of Syrah and Petit Verdot, this old vines wine is a juicy core of brick, tar, blackberry and smoked meat, with an undeniable girth of oak and tannin. It's well-made in a bigger, bolder package.","Red","Zinfandel","US",41675
"16256","Big, big, big! This is a mountain-grown Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's tremendous all around. Explodes in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants, cherries and mocha, and the tannins are strong, but refined. Combines elegance and power, and should develop over the next 6–8 years.","Red","Red Blend","US",16256
"93250","Struck flint and tomato stalk on the nose lead into a medium-bodied wine with strong citrus overtones. White grapefruit and green leafy notes linger on the dry finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",93250
"19092","Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot. But it has much more going for it than that. The tannins are rich and complex, the finish is dry and spicy, and the overall impression is of wine with a great pedigree. Drink over the next six years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19092
"1032","The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand.","White","Chardonnay","US",1032
"77335","Dry and soft, this is a little earthy, so if you're expecting a big, rich wine this might not be for you. It has dried herb, grilled pineapple and smoky oak flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",77335
"105702","While firmly tannic and structured, this wine shows youth with its concentrated fresh berry flavors and bright acidity. The dry core promises a long-term future, so don't drink before 2016.","Red","Red Blend","France",105702
"76268","Lean, dry and crisply focused, with a cutting edge of lime juice and green apple bolstered by hints of crushed stone. Refreshing and clean on the finish.","White","Riesling","New Zealand",76268
"45740","The flavors are deep and delicious in this Pinot with notes of cherries, currants and raspberries, along with a hint of raisins. It's tannic enough to warrant a little time in the cellar. Your window begins to open in 2016, but this isn't an extended ager.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45740
"101597","This concentrated wine opens with aromas of blueberry, leather and a whiff of cocoa. The rich robust palate delivers cassis, blackberry, chocolate and white pepper alongside firm, chewy tannins. Drink through 2023.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",101597
"72109","From an estate vineyard, this wine is somewhat unformed and quite feral, largely tannic, with a rough-hewn texture. The oak is overwhelming and needs time to settle, to better reveal the abundance of strawberry and cherry fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",72109
"52182","Blueberry, vanilla and caramel pop on the nose of this wine from the pioneering brand that is now owned by Bill Foley. Soft yet dense tannins and a plush mouthfeel ensue once sipped, with elderberry, bay leaf and fresh herbs showing on the tightly structured palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",52182
"5034","The old-vine estate vineyard delivers a well-balanced, elegant wine that shows mineral and steel along with tart berry fruit. Despite a much lighter vintage than 2012, there is enough density and depth to reward some additional cellar time.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",5034
"9693","This light-bodied wine brings enjoyment at a very low price. Attractive grapefruit and dried herb aromas followed by citrus and savory flavors make it appetizing and enjoyable. It tastes dry, fairly crisp and well balanced.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",9693
"85980","This bold, firm wine strikes a fine balance between structure and ripe black plum fruit. It has dense tannins that indicate it needs time. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca, it will be ready from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",85980
"7972","Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.","White","Chardonnay","US",7972
"64493","A rewarding wine for its price, this bottling from winemaker Eric Johnson weaves accessible butter-crusted cherry pie and vanilla aromas with bright, nuanced touches of hibiscus, rose petal and mace on the nose. The palate unfolds in layers, mulberry and plum fruit giving way to crushed sage and roasted fennel notes, each as texturally compelling as the last.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64493
"42654","Blending Duras and Syrah indicates how Gaillac is at the median point between the Atlantic and Mediterranean climates in France. The wine is earthy, herbal, rich while rustic. It has a big, spicy background to the red fruits and will certainly develop. Drink from 2016.","Red","Red Blend","France",42654
"37513","A blend of 60% Chardonnay, 30% Chenin Blanc and 10% Mauzac, this is a bright and lively white, with attractive aromas of white flower, clover, pear flesh and lightly grilled peach. The medium-weight palate is remarkably balanced, with ample acidity to lift the ripe apple, pear and citrus flavors, finishing with a kiss of sweet spice.","White","White Blend","France",37513
"5597","For a crianza with eight years of age, this is still fresh and tight as a drum. The bouquet deals earthy, roasted berry aromas while the palate is earthy and toasty, with chocolate and loads of berry flavor. The finish is woody, smoky, firm and focused; drink now through 2016.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",5597
"60933","This wine is still tight and closed. Hints of the lemon and fresh pear fruits are sustained by a crisp, mineral texture. This is a wine to age for a few months, so drink from 2016.","White","Melon","France",60933
"29148","Juicy plum and currant flavors accent the velvety texture of this soft, integrated estate wine. It displays a light sprinkling of black pepper and clove.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",29148
"59218","Even in a year that was not generally “declared” in Port parlance, this estate has produced a fine, full and richly endowed vintage Port. With its blackberry fruit still juicy and upfront, it is still young but delicious now, in a not-too-sweet style that should, ideally, be cellared until 2025.","Port","Port","Portugal",59218
"79358","Grapefruit pith, green apple and sea salt make for a striking nose from fruit grown on one of the appellation's older vineyards. Rich flavors of apple cream, lemon curd and salty caramel carry the palate.","White","Chardonnay","US",79358
"64526","The sourcing for this wine has shifted from Martinborough to Marlborough, but the wine is still well made. It's pale in color, with aromas of strawberry and tomato leaf, and light in weight. The flavors are crisp, clean and inviting, albeit with some herbal overtones. Drink it over the next year or two.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",64526
"42374","From the highest-elevation spot within the producer's Conn Creek vineyard, this wine is sticky and grippy in coffee, red cherry and billowing tannins that reach a soft, round approachability. The finish is part chocolate, part vanilla, both in proportion and in balance, the wine ultimately full of grace.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42374
"90846","With touches of wood and spice, this is round, soft and ready to drink. It has a core of red fruit flavor and an attractive touch of cool-climate acidity.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",90846
"38194","This is a really fragrant wine, with white hedgerow flowers that introduce its rich, full body. It has just a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear and quince flavors, although the texture also has a fine edge of minerality. Age for another 1–2 years.","White","Riesling","France",38194
"101826","A new wine from Norton named after the winery's Austrian owner, Gernot Langes, is a serious Bordeaux-style blend with creamy oak, vanilla, chocolate and espresso on the bouquet. It's deep, dark and full of cassis and berry flavors. All totaled, this is a prized offering that's textured and ripe. It has the right feel and the right stuff in general.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Argentina",101826
"26728","For the price, this is a good deal in a rich California Chardonnay from a major producer. The wine is dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, mangoes and honeysuckle, and the minerally edge that a Calera Chardonnay usually shows.","White","Chardonnay","US",26728
"50992","This delicious, compelling, full-bodied wine blends luscious fruit flavors like red cherry and boysenberry with stylish, spicy oak accents and a firm backing of acidity and tannins to keep the mouthfeel vital. The fruit and softly spicy nuances mingle beautifully and seem to melt in the mouth. It's great to drink through 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50992
"50031","This wine has a floral tone in the aroma that is quite lovely, along with strawberry, spice and pepper tones. On the palate, savory waves of spiced meat, balsamic and spice are rounded out by plum and cherry fruit.","Red","Merlot","Greece",50031
"63640","A big, deep, impressive wine that feels flashy from the first sniff to the last swallow. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, with a splash of Petite Sirah, it's enormously rich in berries, cherries and dark chocolate, with a pleasantly earthy note of olives and herbs. The finish is bone dry. This is a very fine value in a full-bodied red wine of such charm.","Red","Red Blend","US",63640
"97413","Blended with 15% from the Mornington Peninsula, this is a medium-bodied, supple Shiraz with enough crisp acidity for balance. The aromas are dark and loamy, but the palate surprises with red raspberries and darker, earthier, meatier undercurrents. Drink 2010–2018.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",97413
"91464","With 70 g/L residual sugar, this 100% varietal wine drinks quite sweet, with notes of peach, sage and dried Nestea Iced Tea.","White","Riesling","US",91464
"98552","Lots of forward blackberries, cherries, currants and mocha in this ripe wine. It's a bit rustic in the softness and simple structure, though.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",98552
"69448","Smooth and creamy, this shows touches of wood aging and flavors of ripe apple and peach. The toast brings out an attractive spiciness, leaving a complex, fruity finish.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",69448
"85123","Cedar, pencil and wild mushroom scents accent the nose of this wine—a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese. Generous tannins give additional weight to the overall concentration. The finish feels dusted with spicy clove.","Red","Red Blend","US",85123
"79667","The quality is fair for the price on this soft, one-dimensional wine. It has straightforward flavors of sour cherry candy and cranberry sauce.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",79667
"54650","A touch of honey brings a sense of sweetness to the flavors of lemon candy, pineapple juice, green melon and vanilla. Tart acidity provides fine vitality and balance. This shows real Napa Valley finesse.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",54650
"59112","Hints of oak smooth out the inherent herbal character of the grape, yielding ripe tones of apricot and pineapple. This wine is ripe and fruity and ready to drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Portugal",59112
"85735","Winemaker Bill Brousseau works to restrain the powerful ripeness that can come from one of the more famous vineyards in the appellation. This offers a nose with wound-up cranberry fruit, touches of hibiscus and rosebuds, and chipped-slate aromas. The palate shows juniper and pine-needle spice across a juicy black-cherry and black-plum core, with strong acidity and solid structure extending into a savory finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85735
"10688","The color and weight on this Spanish Cabernet are just right. After that, it becomes an insider's wine. Why do we say that? Because it's not like a Napa, Washington or Chilean Cabernet that oozes cassis, plum and sweet French oak. Instead, it shows the terroir of the Mas La Plana vineyard in northeast Spain, and with airing (decanting even better) it becomes a sexy, interesting, Old World Cabernet that delivers provoking, earthier flavors. And it should age well for another decade.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Spain",10688
"67880","This tops a thoroughly outstanding lineup of eight estate-grown Rieslings from Trisaetum. Unctuous citrus and stone fruits abound: a luscious mix of Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit, peach and apricot. There are hints of honey, caramel and butter, and everything is tightened up by defining acidity. Though entirely ageworthy, this is so thoroughly delicious already you'll want to drink at least a bottle or two immediately. Drink now through 2035.","White","Riesling","US",67880
"89300","Ripe, lightly spiced black cherry and berry aromas announce a good but basic wine. The palate is a bit tough in feel but it's solidly built. Candied, generic black-fruit flavors end simply, with modest syrupy sweetness.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",89300
"70463","From organic grapes, this is a soft, red-fruited wine. The tang of acidity is well balanced by the full fruit character. It's ripe and attractively structured.","Rosé","Rosé","France",70463
"47604","A very good Pinot Noir out of Potter Valley, one of inland Mendocino's cooler spots, made by Kenny Likitprakong, who also makes the Hobo and Banyan wines. This cinnamon and red cherry-tinged Pinot opens up with aplomb, getting more and more Burgundian in nose as it goes and at 13.5% alcohol, will get you pleasantly through a meal.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47604
"32855","Thickly concentrated in a rich style, this wine also possesses a balanced backbone of citrus and melon flavor, made more decadent by accompanying marshmallow and vanilla bean notes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",32855
"37061","This tiny-production wine continues to impress vintage after vintage, a small project of the Nunes family, who otherwise farm Nunes Vineyard. Aged in a selection of new and once and twice-used French oak, it impresses in wound-up kirsch, baked bread and cardamom spice, remaining both high toned and smoothly complex on the palate. Rose petals and citrus flirt into the body of the wine as well as the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37061
"26581","From a tremendous vineyard location known for its meticulous farming, this wine was made in small quantities. It exemplifies balance, pitting creamy, voluptuous texture against crisp apple and guava, the acidity never ceding entirely to the oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",26581
"41912","This Bordeaux blend brings expressive, dark, tannic, coffee/toasty flavors to the party. The juice is dark and tangy, tight and compact, but fully ripe and balanced nicely against the tannins and natural acidity. The flavors are layered and seamless, rather than floating along the top of the wine and relying on sugar and oak to fill in where the fruit is lacking. This should be your everyday go-to bottle for Cabernet.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",41912
"35455","Typical aromas of ripe peach, melon and white flowers are elevated on the nose. A slightly oily palate houses floral tones up front, leading to juicy nectarine on the midpalate. A playful, fuzzy feeling round out the finish.","White","Viognier","US",35455
"9788","Highly reputed for its red wines, Vacheron continues to display its skills with this latest vintage. The wine is rich and full with a combination of bright red fruits and a firm, integrated structure. It is a fresh wine now and one that should age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",9788
"29260","Terre di Giumara shows dark concentration and savory aromas of forest floor, barbecue sauce, blackberry and button mushroom. Bitter almond appears on the close and there's a touch of tight astringency as well.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",29260
"133","More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.","White","Riesling","US",133
"16830","Blue flower, dark-skinned berry, star anise, menthol and espresso show on the nose. The aromas carry to the palate, along with dried black cherry, licorice, toast and a hint of sage. Firm, close-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2012–2033.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",16830
"65027","Hints of rubber, iodine and graphite accent concentrated blackberry aromas in front of a chewy, pruny palate. Flavors of rubber and herbs share the stage with prune and raisin, while the finish is rich and plodding, with depth but limited complexity. Drink through 2018.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",65027
"16186","This beautifully balanced, flavorful wine combines vivid watermelon and canteloupe flavors with medium body, a rich texture and lingering finish. It has great concentration without being heavy.","Rosé","Rosé","US",16186
"39624","Ripe black plum, leather and Mediterranean scrub aromas lead the nose. On the round palate, smooth tannins support blackberry jam, vanilla and sweet almond flavors. Enjoy through 2020.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",39624
"92148","The nonexpressive berry and cherry aromas are closed. Light in feel, this tastes of citrus, plum and rhubarb. The lightweight finish is mildly herbal and green.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",92148
"85773","Very ripe, juicy and spicy, this is a forward, fruity wine that should be consumed within the year. It has rich plum and jam flavors, light tannins and a soft aftertaste.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",85773
"10891","Nothing subtle about this Zin, which offers a heady blast of grilled raspberries and cherries. It's a robust wine, with lots of alcohol and spices and a rich finish. This is your go-to summer barbecue wine.","Red","Zinfandel","US",10891
"50254","The aromas on this Petit Verdot seem pinched, offering only restrained notes of wild berry and tired smoky wood. This is a medium-bodied effort, which bears a humdrum midpalate and a textured finish that echoes the smoky wood tone.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",50254
"104127","This is soft, delicate and finessed. It's not a blockbuster, but a silky charmer that offers layers of red currants, Dr. Pepper, vanilla and sandalwood. Ready to drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",104127
"36168","With waves of raspberry, cherry, honeyed cream, cinnamon and caramelized oak flavors, this defines the word delicious. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity and delicate tannins. Just superb to drink now; try pairing it with lamb that's been salted and peppered, seasoned with a hint of rosemary.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36168
"53531","This most powerful of Grand Cru vineyards has yielded another blockbuster. Even in the 2011 vintage, the wine is a massive statement, packed with rich fruits, dark tannins and layers of blackberry and juicy acidity. The wine has a dry texture, that will soften slowly over many years. Drink from 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",53531
"54721","Succulent scents and flavors of cherry liqueur, laced with marzipan and a whiff of earthy funk define this new single-vineyard selection. Tannins are thick and offer suggestions of tanned leather.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",54721
"80133","This bold, ripe blend even contains some Muscat that gives richness and a touch of honey and spice to what is otherwise a dry rosé. The acidity acts as a balance to this attractive wine.","Rosé","Rosé","France",80133
"89166","A mix of pie cherry, raisin and prune fruit flavors, this is deep, ripe and yet still quite tart, with plenty of acidity. It penetrates the palate with consistent flavors, a fruit pastry impression wrapped in dark chocolate. The only question—how will it age, with fruit already this far along the aging curve?","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89166
"81383","Thick and concentrated, this wine needs more time to unwind, ideally through 2021, showing tightly sewn layers of blackberry, cassis, black olive and tar.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",81383
"18767","You'll find an herbal note in this wine, suggesting sweet green peas and dried herbs alongside riper touches of blackberry and cherry. Although it's pretty tannic, it's soft, making it drinkable now. It could be ideal with shepherd's pie.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",18767
"56240","Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, this is a fine, smooth and rich wine. Great tannins are cushioned within the ripe blackberry fruits and generous texture. It is already a delicious wine, although certain to age as well. The estate is close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2022.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",56240
"94045","Illogically, there are two second wines at this estate. This is the richer of the two (the other is Lions). It has intensity, spice, ripe apricot fruit and a smooth, dense texture. Its honey and botrytis notes are just right while the thread of acidity keeps it all in place. Drink from 2019.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",94045
"90919","Aromas of blackberries are set against freshly milled cedar, dried flowers, chopped herbs and a bit of iron. Oregano and thyme lead the palate, with slightly sour boysenberry fruit as well as espresso, dark chocolate and camphor, leaning on herbs more than ripe fruit.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90919
"27604","Like its stablemates, the Elton bottling has dropped more than a point of alcohol in 2010, and the winery's lineup overall tilts toward the thin and herbal. Here the cranberry fruit shows little charm. There's a spine of iron and a finish amply loaded with flavors of herb and earth.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27604
"62119","Here's a soft, juicy wine with melted tannins in the modern style and some nice blackberry flavors. It's young now, a saucy wine that hasn't yet fully come together. But all the pieces are there. Drink it at three or four years of age.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62119
"79476","Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon take the lead on this Bordeaux-style blend that brings overt notes of vanilla, coconut and dark fruit, with the barrel notes riding high. It's full bodied and rich with the oak overtaking the varietal flavors but still offering appeal.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",79476
"73799","This is a medium-dry wine that has more spice than sweetness. It is warm and full in the mouth, and accented with a touch of pepper, brisk acidity and lychee flavors. The wine is rich and ready to drink. Screwcap.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",73799
"34335","Lemon zest on nose and palate signal a very zippy, citrus-scented white with a rather neutral aromatic expression—as befits unoaked Chardonnay from a cool year. It is light bodied and cannot be beaten for freshness.","White","Chardonnay","Austria",34335
"65418","Medium weight and nicely focused, this brings spicy fruit flavors of cranberry and cherry into play. There's ample tart acidity, and aging 16 months in 42% new French oak has not turned it into a walk through a lumber yard.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",65418
"28410","Grillo, Catarratto and Chardonnay are blended together to produce a rich and creamy white wine, with overtones of vanilla, apricot and honey. It is fresh, not at all heavy or flat.","White","White Blend","Italy",28410
"32222","Earthy, gamy aromas are intense and suggest meaty berry fruits and animal hide. In the mouth, this mystery red blend feels jammy but soft at its core. Baked black-fruit and chocolate flavors finish with a chewy texture and notes of fudge and cassis. For the price, this is a generous wine that overdelivers; drink through 2019.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",32222
"87441","Plump, sweet and creamy in texture, with apple and citrus flavors that offer simple, straightforward pleasure. Good quality, impressive for the 50,000 cases produced.","White","Riesling","Germany",87441
"27664","The wine is rich—a beautiful blend dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre. The grapes gives both structure and a perfumed character to this ripe full wine. With acidity and layers of red fruits, it is worth aging. Drink from 2018.","Rosé","Rosé","France",27664
"94849","Put your nose to the glass and you will be rewarded with extreme floral fragrances that suggest naturally aromatic grapes are used over a Chard base. Ultimately, this is a very feminine, lady-like wine busting with white flowers and naturally sweet aromas.","White","White Blend","Italy",94849
"48276","Classic notes of lychee and rose petal waft on the nose of this delicate Gewürztraminer. Off dry in style, it's brisk and dancing, offsetting plush, juicy white grapefruit with spice and honey. Finishes briskly on a sugary pastry note.","White","Gewürztraminer","Germany",48276
"81583","Bernard Magrez's wine empire seems to have no limits, as he's recently expended into this relatively obscure little section of the Southern Rhône known for its white wines. This medium- to full-bodied blend of Grenache Blanc, Clairette, Viognier and Roussanne features modest pear and pineapple flavors and a refreshing zing of citrus zest on the finish. Drink now.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","France",81583
"46619","Fresh-squeezed apple juice, grapefruit spritzer and nearly sweet cherry aromas sit atop minerality on the nose of this blend of 46% Viognier, 19% Verdelho, 19% Vermentino and 16% Sauvignon Blanc. There's a lot of tart acidity, with a lingering apple flavor.","White","White Blend","US",46619
"36623","Soft and honeyed, with vanilla-tinged flavors of all sorts of tropical fruits that finish with a spicy hit of butterscotch. A blend of Chardonnay, Muscat and Chenin Blanc.","White","White Blend","US",36623
"32370","From two vineyards located in the warmer part of Santa Ynez Valley, this Sauvignon Blanc was mostly fermented in stainless steel, with a portion in neutal oak. The result is a nice, rich and creamy wine, slightly sweet in citrus, apricot and vanilla bean flavors, and balanced with crisp acidity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",32370
"64604","Truffle, leather, scorched earth, menthol and steeped plum aromas lead the way on this full-bodied red. The brawny palate offers dried black cherry steeped in spirits, blackberry confiture, licorice, cinnamon and mocha alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish. Give it a few more years to fully come together. Drink 2018–2026.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",64604
"101777","Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine shows a downright mesmerizing sense of purity with its aromas of purple fruit, herb, fresh flower, earth and iron. The flavors dazzle but win with elegance and sophistication along with a drawn-out finish.","Red","Syrah","US",101777
"14571","This is a soft, tropical-fruit flavored wine. It has a tangy, mineral texture that cuts through the riper fruitiness to give a wine that is easy and very drinkable now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",14571
"83775","Gentle spice and redcurrant notes promise a subtle wine. The palate does not disappoint and sings with translucent, light-footed elegance. This is all about charm and ease, about chiffon rather than velvet. Crisp freshness brightens and lightens everything. It's a mere whiff of a wine but a delicious one.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",83775
"12807","More than 75% of this wine comes from Ciel du Cheval vineyard, with the rest from Upchurch. A blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, it's reserved at present, with light aromas of woodspice, coffee, assorted dried herbs and mineral. The cherry and cassis flavors show a mixture of richness and restraint, persisting on the finish along with enough tannins to go the distance. It will be best 2022–2027.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",12807
"93801","Very rich and jammy, this full-bodied wine grown at 2,500 feet has spicy oak aromas, lavishly ripe blackberry and dried cherry flavors and a mouth-coating texture. Its vanilla, nutmeg and toasted bread aromas meld nicely with all the fruit notes for a complex, showy, wine.","Red","Syrah","US",93801
"38128","Vanilla and white fruits on the nose lead this fuller bodied organic Chard. On the palate, a spicy, robust style of white unfolds, making it ideal for everything from salmon to creamy poultry dishes. Nice spicy finish.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",38128
"26217","Pommard and Dijon clones planted in 2001 fuel this tasty wine. Its dusty plum and black cherry fruit carries a touch of dark chocolate, all framed by firm yet polished tannins. Built to age, it can be enjoyed now with a good decanting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26217
"45055","A ripe, powerful Pinot, this wine is bursting with sweet cherry, chocolate and vanillan oak spice. The palate brings forth more ripe fruit with chewy but well structured tannins and a savory finish. Drink now–2024.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",45055
"29306","Pedro Vargas has made a nice Merlot in this strongly herbal, plum and cassis concoction inviting in its layers of oak and tobacco. Soft, it finishes lean and is all in all integrated and well-made.","Red","Merlot","US",29306
"24749","This Pinot Nero is neutral on the nose with distant tones of small berry and violet. There's more power in the mouth, thanks to the long and silky nature of the tannins.","Red","Pinot Nero","Italy",24749
"30937","Light volatile notes distract from the aromas. It's a shame because the tart dark cherry flavors provide plenty of enjoyment.","Red","Syrah","US",30937
"104093","Made by Niepoort for importer Broadbent Selections, this is a structured wine, showing dry tannins and density. The fruit is all there as well, offering fresh acidity, crushed raspberries and red plums. Alongside the ripeness, there is a dry core of tannin.","Port","Port","Portugal",104093
"89874","This is a very fresh, very herbaceous wine. It's crisp with its pink grapefruit and lively acidity. Good with fish, but just as good as an apéritif.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",89874
"64413","Dusty, yeasty, waxy apple aromas open this Verdejo, which feels wet and juicy, with scouring acidity. Lemony flavors include a note of orange peel, and the wine finishes tangy and tart.","White","Verdejo","Spain",64413
"654","The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",654
"75799","Good price, but the wine is green and unripe, with that unpleasant meow odor that turns many people off.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",75799
"87185","Sharpness compromises this wine. Whether the acidity is natural or added, it's intrusive, cutting the palate and giving a sour candy taste to the blackberries, currants and cherries. Ready now.","Red","Syrah","US",87185
"27822","This plump and fruit-driven Barbaresco offers nuances of ripe cherry and forest berry backed by lingering tones of licorice, vanilla, dark chocolate and clove. The wine is distinguished by a precise and focused mouthfeel that is shaped by acidity and firm tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",27822
"94702","Allspice and black raspberries lead off the nose, followed by flavors of juicy plum and thyme on the palate. Accents of milk chocolate and earth add complexity to the otherwise straightforward selection. Nicely balanced with a strong, sweet-spice, lingering finish.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",94702
"77918","Move past the initial, yeasty simplicity of this wine. It's unusual, to say the least, a white wine made exclusively from this dark Bordeaux red. Skin flavors and light, lemony fruit are in play, with hints of cucumber, white peach and melon.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",77918
"69009","Made with 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Syrah, this opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, toast, leather and Oriental spice. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla and oak-driven spice alongside fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",69009
"56373","Lovely fragrances of pressed powder, black berries, rose and tilled soil waft from the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and savory herb alongside tightly knit but refined tannins. Fresh acidity balances this out but it's still young and not fully developed. Drink 2020–2030.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",56373
"50070","This appealing wine demonstrates the exciting potential for Malbec in Southern Oregon. Fresh, zippy acids underscore bright raspberry and black-cherry fruit, framed in chocolate with a dash of sea salt. The finish resonates with lightly applied baking spices and cayenne pepper.","Red","Malbec","US",50070
"49316","Rich and full, this wine shows some sense of structure. It has considerable acidity and flavors of cherry and red currant. With the dry tannins coming through on the finish, it will need some years to soften.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",49316
"64141","A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.","White","Riesling","France",64141
"11849","Gone far away are the days when a Chinon normally clocked in at 12.5% alcohol. Now, as with this Clos de l'Echo, there is more power. Here, the power is put to good use, giving both a bold wine and one that has a sophisticated balance of firm, dry tannins and elegant black plum fruits. Age this wine for at least four years.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",11849
"94633","A jumbled mix of aromas includes notes of rubber, berry fruits, plum, grass, fennel and oak. In the mouth, this is full and blocky. Rubbery flavors of plum and berry finish salty, savory and spicy, with unintegrated oak that stands out.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",94633
"39309","This is a fine Cabernet, with ripe berry, cherry and cola flavors, tinged with smoky oak. The tannins are firm but pliant, making it drinkable now, though it could develop bottle complexity over the years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",39309
"81361","Deep purple in color, with an inky nose that brings licorice and jammy black fruit aromas. This is a lush, soft-bodied style of Syrah with a meaty mouthfeel and candied, jammy flavors of blackberry and stewed black cherry. Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.","Red","Syrah","Argentina",81361
"52628","Shows unusual intensity for a Marlborough Pinot Noir, revealing powerful cherry fruit, slightly herbal underpinnings and a subtle frame of spice and vanilla shadings. The structure is firm without being hard, the tannins soft and welcoming. Drink now–2015.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",52628
"49738","A lacy spray of sweetness extends from start to finish on this fruity, fresh Kabinett. Fresh apple, pear and tangerine are honeyed and lip smacking, energized by a streak of lemonade acidity on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",49738
"101196","A tasty Sauvignon Blanc, with crisply acidic grapefruit, pineapple and lime juice flavors, touched with oak. A nice appetizer sipper, with some complexity. Good with asparagus risotto, bruschetta with goat cheese, a nice roast chicken with sautéed new potatoes and rosemary.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",101196
"22133","There's a shrillness to this wine, rich in overripe, preserved lemon and a daunting taste and aroma of oak. The body and weight of the wine don't overpower, but the fruit and oak don't seem in balance.","White","Chardonnay","US",22133
"36270","With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3–4 years, although not much beyond that.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",36270
"20638","American wine lovers should definitely make an effort to seek and taste Pinot Bianco, a white wine from northern Italy. The variety has excellent structure and softness for easy food pairing and offers measured tones of peach and melon that won't interfere with delicate seafood dishes.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",20638
"48648","This is from a great vineyard near the Wohler Bridge in Forestville, and the fruit is well-represented in this bottle. Boldly layered, and richly designed, it's fragrantly floral with cherry blossoms. Those scents are paired with contiguous flavors of raspberry and cherry. Within a framework of upfront but integrated tannin and oak, it finds balance on the earthy finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",48648
"33969","This vineyard straddles the cool-hot line between Anderson Valley and Alexander Valley, but in this vintage, warm weather won out. The wine is good, but too full-bodied, and wants the delicacy Pinot Noir demands. The flavors have a heaviness more akin to Syrah. —S.H.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33969
"79545","Crisp apple aromas lead to a spicy, yellow and melon-flavored wine. With its touches of vanilla and warm, ripe character, the wine is full and generous. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",79545
"10156","Very focused and pure fruit aromas and flavors give this medium-bodied wine a tasty and straightforward personality. The texture is relaxed due to soft acidity and tannins, and everything tastes fresh and clean.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",10156
"47344","Barolo Rocche di Castiglione is a classic wine with crisp lines, great structure and loads of complexity. Aromas of spice, red fruit, leather and tobacco are well integrated and never over the top. The finish offers compelling intensity with touches of chopped mint and licorice.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",47344
"86418","With vineyards close to the Gironde, this is a well-situated château. This 2012 is one of the best from the property for several years, giving ripe tannins, balanced wood and good black currant acidity. It's not for long-term aging, so drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",86418
"73953","Lightweight and lacking in texture, this wine offers fading red-cherry fruit, cola notes and leafy greens. Drink up.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",73953
"93823","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Sangiovese shows bright aromas of cassis and blackberry. Light touches of spice and leather lend the finish heft and determination.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",93823
"84863","Crisp red cherry and berry flavors are pristine and forward in this bright, vivacious wine. Yet it's also surprisingly nuanced with deft touches of bitter coffee bean, vanilla, bramble and herb that last through the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Germany",84863
"58166","A polished, softly delicious Merlot, at a good price for the quality. It's dry and richly tannic, with complex flavors of black cherries, red currants, red licorice, Indian spices and sandalwood. Ready now, but only 200 cases were produced.","Red","Merlot","US",58166
"18499","Crisp citrusy aromas include notes of crushed vitamin and ocean breeze. This is tangy and speedy on the palate, with racy acidity. Tangerine and lime flavors are stony, while this is fresh, lasting and citrusy on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",18499
"81005","Simple and refreshing, this opens with a light floral fragrance and a whiff of pear. The easy palate offers tart green apple and a citrus note alongside bright acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",81005
"36463","Here's a soulful red with earthy aromas wet soil, underbrush, ripe, violet, berry, leather and a funky whiff of game. The palate presents juicy wild cherry, crushed black raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon and grilled herb alongside firm, refined tannins and bright acidity. A tobacco note closes the finish. It's already accessible but also shows staying power. Drink 2018–20230.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",36463
"4759","This is soft, unfocused and gently fruity. Hints of herbal and citrus flavors give a green-fruit character to the wine, which has a tight, nervy aftertaste.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",4759
"20809","Ample helpings of allspice, clove and orange peel add dimensions to the hearty cherry and hibiscus on the nose of this entry-level wine made by the Talley family. Rich red cherry, vanilla, cinnamon and clove show on the sip. While it's not very complex, it is quite tasty for a midweek sipper.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",20809
"8843","Typically Calera's most luscious, delicious wine in youth. The year 2007 was kind, and the result is a Pinot rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and cola, wrapped into a silky texture, with near perfect acids and tannins. As good as it is now, it should develop over the next 6–8 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",8843
"65063","A subdued nose of earth and chocolate leads into a fresh, lively and finely textured palate of red and black cherry. The texture is crunchy and refreshing, with an aromatic, enticing echo. A very clean finish on a refreshing, cherry-flavored wine.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",65063
"10120","This reserve is the best of Kason's 2007 releases, with cranberry fruit, minty spice, moderate tannins and overall balance. The thinness of the vintage shows through, and this will need to be drunk now, rather than cellared. Aging in 80% new French oak puts some toast into the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",10120
"43838","A blend of 41% Grenache, 37% Syrah, 14% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 4% Cinsault from seven vineyards, this longtime Margerum-fan favorite shows boisterous wild berries, allspice-laced brioche, juicy hibiscus and fresh watermelon notes on the fun, inviting nose. It's juicy, light and easy drinking, with hints of anise and dried mint that give character to the bright red fruit.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",43838
"54122","A rich but well balanced wine, this features ripe flavors and integrated tannins. A juicy black-currant note sits with the dusty structure, with fragrant acidity on the finish. The Château Sainte-Barbe is at the end of the promontory that lies between the Dordogne and Garonne Rivers just before they meet.","Red","Merlot","France",54122
"70489","Lush flavors of cherry jam, red currants and licorice are enhanced with new French oak to make this wine softly delicious. A few drops of other red varieties, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, add to its structure and depth.","Red","Merlot","US",70489
"101346","Dark, smoky, herbal aromas come with cheesy notes of oak and horse hide. This has a wiry, high-acid mouthfeel and herbal, spicy, pinched dark-berry flavors. High acidity creates a racy sensation on an oaky, fast-paced finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",101346
"66955","The restrained nose of this bottling shows red cherry, dusty earth, sagebrush and a bit of rosebud. The palate blends the sour and sweet tones of candied cranberry with thyme and bay leaf, proving quite clean and tasty.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66955
"26817","A light, juicy and soft wine, it is already drinkable. It has red berry fruits, gentle tannins and acidity. A dry aftertaste comes along with fresh fruits. Drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",26817
"97349","Just beautiful, a crisp wine of authoritative structure that brilliantly shows off the ripeness of its fruit. Waves of Meyer lemon purée, Key lime pie, white peach, tangerine and spice flavors wash over the palate and last for a long, rich finish. Drink this bone-dry wine now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",97349

"37740","The nose is rather restrained but the palate comes alive with ripe lemon and zesty tangerine. This is dry and concentrated, with a lovely vein of lemon freshness that pervades and brightens the entire experience. Prepare to be refreshed. This is luminous, fresh and so illustrative of the 2014 vintage: A challenge that yielded such jewels in the right hands. Lovely now but with ample mileage. Drink 2017–2037","White","Riesling","France",37740
"13174","A pale-colored wine that has an attractive yeasty character that matches well with the crisp red fruits. It has a hint of tannin as well as red berries. The wine is fruity and ready to drink.","Sparkling","Portuguese Sparkling","Portugal",13174
"31758","This holds two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot. Oak aromas of butterscotch, woodspice and vanilla are out in front of cherry and herbs. On the palate, the oak flavors lead, followed by coffee and cherry. It seems a bit heavy-handed right now but may come together with time.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",31758
"8218","Leesy mango and lime aromas are fleshy, but attractive. A plump, juicy palate is holding its own, while flavors of pithy orange and melon end in a friendly, round fashion.","White","Verdejo","Spain",8218
"87802","This wine has classic style, showing a rather light, traditional color and woodsy, earthy, herbal aromas, with tantalizing and complex fruity and savory flavors. A firm texture and flavor complexity highlight elegance rather than ripeness. It was aged in barrels whose staves were seasoned four years before assembling.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",87802
"72202","Named after the mistress of Portugual's King João V who lived at this estate, the wine is a super-ripe expression of the warmth of an Alentejo wine. It is a powerful, structured although the tannins are surrounded by ripe berry and damson fruit flavors. It is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",72202
"69193","Racy and refined, this opens with alluring scents of fragrant white flower, citrus and white stone fruit. The vibrant, balanced palate delivers apple, white peach, tangerine and flinty mineral. It finishes crisp and clean.","White","Riesling","Italy",69193
"58009","This is rich, full of spicy fruit, apricot juice and white peaches. The fruits are topped by an unctuous honey character that pushes the wine towards sweetness while keeping a fresh flavor in the background. Drink from 2017.","White","Pinot Gris","France",58009
"4802","This full-bodied red opens with aromas suggesting French oak, raspberry jam coconut and exotic spice. The densely concentrated assertive palate offers licorice, dried cherry, tart cranberry and powdered sage while astringent grainy tannins provide an austere framework. You'll also detect the heat of evident alcohol.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",4802
"9304","Fleshy cherry fruit becomes immediately apparent, while on the palate the fruit acquires a spicy edge of appetizing white pepper. This is lip-smackingly fresh, even tart, but in a very appetizing, bracing way that will mellow with another year or two in bottle. The fruit is crunchy and juicy, the tannins are ripe and fine and wood smoke hovers deliciously.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",9304
"51933","Focused and elegant, this aromatic wine rewards your sniff test with highlights of pine needle and resin, along with beet root and a slight impression of wax. It's a bit stiff and tight, and should be decanted if you are drinking it any time before 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",51933
"63373","Fresh, crunchy red cherries are overcast by darker notions of iron oxide, peony petals and aromatic cinnamon. This makes for a brooding but fresh, intriguing but crunchy experience. This scintillates between light and dark and shimmers with a softly tannic grip. This is fresh, has backbone and immense purity. It elevates Zweigelt to a higher plane.","Red","Zweigelt","Austria",63373
"29033","Heavy oak on top of cherry aromas results in a chemical-driven, woody bouquet. This feels high in acid, with an oaky, resiny offset. Sour plum, vanilla and resiny flavors finish short, lean and citric.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",29033
"103923","This opens with aromas of forest floor, truffle, ripe berry, leather, crushed blue flower and a whiff of herb. The medium-bodied, concentrated palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and nutmeg alongside integrated tannins that give the finish grip. Drink 2018–2024.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",103923
"87210","This medium-bodied wine has a vivid smoky aroma that gives way to fresh strawberry and raspberry notes on the palate. It feels juicy, slightly tart and light.","Red","Merlot","US",87210
"99747","Wild berry, chopped mint, sun baked soil and violet aromas meld together on this solid savory red. The juicy straightforward palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2018.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",99747
"16223","Deep aromas of kirsch, ginger snaps and leather show on the nose of this ripe and hearty bottling from a vineyard named for the geographic feature that allows ocean air to cool down this region. Dried cherries, clove and star anise show on the palate, which is framed by firm tannins and cut by a steady but not overpowering acidity.","Red","Grenache","US",16223
"35768","While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage. The balance with the wood aging is so right that you feel the toast rather than tasting it. As it matures, the wine will deepen in intensity and power, certainly over the next 5–10 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",35768
"45592","Lovingston's medium-bodied Bordeaux Blend is pleasantly grapy on the nose with an undertone of darkly toasted oak, nuts and savory spices. The palate holds a decent amount of black fruit, but with a green, underripe vein and fairly high level of acidity and tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",45592
"103760","With massive fruit and power, this low production (300 case) Zinfandel will make lovers of the Shelton style exult, while others might find it lacking elegance. But there's no doubting the potency of the wild berry, licorice, cola, cedar and spice flavors, which earn this wine its high score.","Red","Zinfandel","US",103760
"64479","Marc Piro broke away from his day job at Au Bon Climat to produce this first vintage of his own delicious wine. Cranberry and pomegranate aromas meld with sagebrush, thyme and peppercorn on the nose. Bright energy pops on the palate, showing cherry, cranberry, sage and bay leaf flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64479
"5869","Fresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors. A long, firm, flavorful finish brings a slight hint of citrus  pith the longer it runs out.","White","Verdejo","Spain",5869
"104793","Aromas suggesting rose water, leather, woodland berry, forest floor, cake spice and a balsamic note lead the way. The taut palate offers juicy black cherry, tart cranberry, baking spice and chopped herb alongside firm, polished tannins. A note of star anise closes the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2023.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",104793
"13037","A touch of reduction still clings to the citrus and pear notes of this clean-cut wine. The palate fill out with notes of citrus and green, freshly cut Conference pear—it has juicy concentration and provides a lip-smacking finish.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",13037
"44472","Stalky cranberry aromas are incomplete and properly announce a soupy, clumsy palate. Green, weedy red-berry flavors have an accent of carob. Tannic and herbaceous on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",44472
"100127","Densely purple scents of blackberry jam, plum, cola, cherry extract and dried violet syrup overcome the nose on this wine from a property once owned by a famous composer. The flavors are quite jammy, but given complexity by nuances of dark chocolate and espresso beans. Decent acidity and solid tannins will make this last. Drink 2018–2024.","Red","Tempranillo","US",100127
"60874","A confected wine that shows polished wood and mint flavors but little fruit. It puts on a great show, but without depth.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",60874
"62152","Dusty apple and peach aromas are mostly pleasant. Chunky and pulpy in feel, this basic Chardonnay tastes of melon and peach. A dry fleshy finish includes a sprinkle of saltiness. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",62152
"57053","From the mica soil of Goulaine, this single-parcel wine is rich and full in the mouth. Aged for three years in tank, the wine is now mature, ripe and rounded with yellow fruits as well as a strong citrus element. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",57053
"18494","A classic blend of local Alentejo grapes along with Cabernet Sauvignon has produced a smoothly structured wine. With its juicy black fruit acidity and layer of dry tannins under the fruit, it is both ripe and ageworthy. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",18494
"72881","Pithy green fruit aromas are short but within normal parameters for the variety. Feels a bit heavy, with a baNAa influence. Flavors of soft citrus and melon are middling, while the finish is weighty.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",72881
"53283","This is a soft wine, ripe with apricot and melon flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage, round and gently fruity. Almonds and a tangy aftertaste give a crisp finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",53283
"103035","From vines close to the Sainte-Victoire mountain, the wine is crisply textured, with tangy red currants. It is a bright stylish wine, finely balanced and lifted with acidity and fruitiness. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",103035
"39708","Here's a big, lusty Zinfandel. It leaves little to the imagination, swamping the mouth with sweetly ripe raspberries, cherries and mocha. Perfect for drinking with a great cheeseburger or plate of lasagna.","Red","Zinfandel","US",39708
"33661","With an opaque purple tint and brawny, gaseous aromas of raw oak, bacon, black olive and blackberry, this old-vine Cabernet is blocky, tannic and bullish. Intense, toasty flavors of herbal blackberry and baked plum finish muscular, blackened, herbal and a touch bitter. Best from 2017–2022.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",33661
"85563","This has come to epitomize the Hawke's Bay style of Sauvignon Blanc, typical in it's ripe fruit and oak treatment. Hints of vanilla and cedar frame passion fruit and pink grapefruit notes, then leave a lingering impression of Creamsicle behind on the silky-textured finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",85563
"24836","Here's a finely crafted and rich expression of Barbaresco with evident oak tones that are enhanced by mature berry fruit, cola and creamy vanilla. The wine shows very nice saturation, richness and persistency. It also has a sour note of astringency on the close at this young stage in its life. Drink after 2015.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",24836
"75000","Hibiscus, rose petal and sour cranberry kick off the nose of this bottling, but its most compelling aroma is the stark and ethereal minerality, recalling iron and crushed gravel. Strawberry fruit pops on the palate, as does ripe cranberry, but that earthy soil and crushed rock quality rises to the top again.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75000
"7075","Good structured fruit, with ripe sweet cherry flavors, appears alongside hints of raspberries. Fresh, but with some weight and solidity.","Red","Gamay","France",7075
"31299","The aromas of wood spice, violets and dark fruit are high toned and brooding. The palate offers firm tannins but also a sense of balance that provides intrigue.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",31299
"100749","Ripe and wood aged, this is rich with ginger and tropical fruit flavors. Dense and concentrated, it is a full-in-the-mouth wine—powerful and very ageworthy. Give this five years.","White","Chardonnay","France",100749
"78954","Blue flower, ripe plum, baking spice and pine forest scents lead the nose. The palate is still tense and tightly drawn, showing tart sour cherry, star anise and a hint of espresso through flexed, fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink after 2020.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",78954
"103818","The vineyard is high up the slope, giving this wine that has good acidity and crispness. The acidity is light and bright, while the texture is concentrated and mineral. It is going to develop as a fine, ripe wine. Drink from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",103818
"53739","This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",53739
"22480","Intriguing layers of fruit and herbs interplay on the delicious nose of this bottling, showing bay leaf, thyme, oregano, pepper, hibiscus and cherry. The palate is rich and savory, with more of the same roasting herbs as well as fig, black olive, black pepper, fennel and purple-flower flavors. It's quite rich and delicious.","Red","Grenache","US",22480
"59241","Ripe and impressively rich for a wine from so far north in Burgundy, this has yellow fruits, crisp acidity and a textured edge of acidity. There is a mineral element to this otherwise creamy, fruity wine. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",59241
"75711","Intensely mineral, this dry, laser-focused Riesling expresses the stark purity of Mosel's 2013 vintage. Shimmering acidity bristles the palate, accentuating fresh apple and pear flavors. The finish is cool, steely and long.","White","Riesling","Germany",75711
"100157","A little smokier in flavor and a little firmer in mouthfeel than other comparable wines, this has an intriguing angular personality that's intended not for cocktail hour but for pairing with, say, a roast pheasant. It has tart-cherry and berry flavors, some light peppery, woodsy accents and lusty, gripping tannins. Best after 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",100157
"97173","A bit hot and crusty on the nose, with black fruit and herbal notes of olive and bramble. The palate is full but hard as nails, with a tannic bite that is wicked like a shark. Flavors are full and drying due to the tannins, with herbal accents. Finishing flavors of coffee and spice cement its dark, muscular status.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",97173
"47590","Leveled by 4% Grenache, this Syrah, which is made in Paso's Tin City district, is rich and lush on the nose. Black cherries and lavender-chocolate truffle are lifted aromatically by herbes du provence. The black-fruit-laden palate is dense with blueberries, maple syrup, dark caramel and touch of black peppercorn.","Red","Syrah","US",47590
"80083","The top red from Chocapalha, this comes from a single parcel. It has concentrated tannins, along with the minty flavors that come from new wood. Balancing that combination are the rich fruits: blackberry, damson along with a touch of licorice. It's a powerful wine that needs aging. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",80083
"98024","Made from equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this is dry, tannic and oaky, and it offers blackberry jam and black currant flavors.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",98024
"58955","Named after the matriarch of the Riboli wine family, who founded what may be the first tasting room in California, this shows light yellow fruits on the nose. The palate combines lemon and apple with a slight hue of brown spice, offering plump fruit with a tang.","White","Chardonnay","US",58955
"73042","A single-clone, single-vineyard, estate wine. Released young, it is oaky, liquorous and sharply volatile. Plenty of plum and sweet berry fruit flavors suggest a wine with the power to age, but at the moment it has not come together, and has a vinegary bite to the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",73042
"105984","This is predominantly Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah filling out the blend. As with many of the H3 wines, vanilla is the strongest and most noticeable flavor. The fruit is compact, and it tastes like hard cherry candy. There is plenty of power, but not much subtlety.","Red","Red Blend","US",105984
"50922","This is a polished and attractive medium-bodied wine. It offers classic apple and pear aromas, and light vanilla and nutmeg flavors. Balanced a little toward softness rather than crispness, it's very easy in texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",50922
"59355","This pretty wine showcases aromas of yellow flowers and exotic fruit. The bright palate offers honeydew melon, apple and a hint of almond alongside crisp acidity that leaves a quenching finish.","White","Garganega","Italy",59355
"26804","Young and tight, this new release from a founding Oregon viticulture family already shows good balance in a smooth, buttery, somewhat oaky style. The fruit flavors coat the tongue and roll into the seductive barrel notes. Let this bottle age until early 2016 and it will really shine.","White","Chardonnay","US",26804
"84431","Butter, pear and baking spice aromas are followed by a rounded palate with sweet fruit flavors. Pair it with baked chicken.","White","Chardonnay","US",84431
"101355","Not all that clean or clear up front, with aromas of sweated onion and field greens. The palate is fairly sharp and tangy, with pickled flavors of sour apple and lemon. Citrusy on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",101355
"524","Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper.","White","Pinot Gris","US",524
"93662","Featuring some dusty tannins on the finish, this is fairly structured for Aussie Grenache. Dried herbs and dried cherries are balanced by hints of dusty earth on the long finish. Drink 2013–2017.","Red","Grenache","Australia",93662
"35203","This powerful wine is sourced from 100-year-old vines in the famous Deaver vineyard. There's a touch of pepper behind the thick tannins and oak. It's a long lasting wine with leathery blackberry fruit that should come to the fore over time.","Red","Zinfandel","US",35203
"52749","Baked and rubbery up front, with asphalt, roasted peanut and black fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's solid and stately, with black plum and raspberry flavors, good balance and a taught, muscular structure. It tastes bright and mildly complex. Drink now through 2014.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",52749
"28608","Strong classy oak aromas lead blackberry and baking-spice scents on a potent but textbook RDD nose. This old-vines wine from a benchmark year is tight-fisted and linear in feel, with lemony acidity. Fully oaked flavors of blackberry and cassis sit comfortably on a bed of herb and spice notes, while this is oaky, spicy, steady and integrated on the finish. Drink through 2027.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",28608
"81036","Pieropan's basic Soave Classico offers refreshing aromas of stone fruit, honeysuckle, grapefruit and lime. The wine is light and crisp with tonic acidity on the close and an easy, direct approach.","White","Garganega","Italy",81036
"89126","A savory note of yeast swings along the green pear and grapefruit peel notes on this totally brisk and refreshing Grüner. Yes, the customary texture and spice are there but this is, as a sign of its vintage, totally streamlined and refreshing, with taut acidity reverberating in every corner. For those who like superfresh wines.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",89126
"90900","This is a finely etched wine with just the right balance between its ripe fruits and tannins. Structured while also juicy, it has a mint and black-currant freshness as well as a dry core that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",90900
"6721","An earthy, leathery aromatic character carries over to the palate of this wine, joined by ripe plum flavors. The blend here is 53% Mourvèdre and 47% Syrah, feeling full-bodied, firmly tannic and ready for cassoulet.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",6721
"34579","A heavy dose of petrol is the aromatic greeting, and it comes with hints of rubber, latex and waxy white fruits. Feels tangy and fresh due to blazing acidity, while it tastes both of tropical fruits and diesel. Long and chiseled on the finish.","White","Riesling","Chile",34579
"71937","Light, off-dry and refreshing, this would make an ideal poolside sipper. Hints of damp moss and fern add complexity to green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.","White","Riesling","Australia",71937
"30440","Fresh herb and black currant aromas lead to ripe black-cherry flavors. It's fruit-forward and provides a lot of easy-drinking appeal.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",30440
"74275","This is a stony, savory style of rosé, with its ample weight backed by firm acids and only modest melon fruit. It's a style better suited to food than casual sipping on its own.","Rosé","Rosé","France",74275
"58691","This pretty Brunello riserva shows elegant tones of candied fruit, prune, leather, rum cake and dried rosemary. The wine is smooth and fine, with silky tannins and a elegantly aged quality. Don't wait too long to drink this wine.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",58691
"74174","This wine is generous, rounded and soft. Rich red fruits dominate, exploding in the mouth with red cherry and raspberry flavors. It is a soft wine, perfumed with delicious, forward fruitiness. Drink from 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",74174
"22559","Cupinero is a softly oaked red that's immediately likeable. It makes an elegant first impression with sweet cherry, white peppercorn, chocolate and exotic spice. Wood tones are more evident in the mouth, where vanilla and toasted flavors take over. Drink after 2010.","Red","Merlot","Italy",22559
"29869","It brings a Northwest Cabernet profile of black currant, plum, licorice and light herbs with medium-bodied feel. A touch of sweetness rounds out the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",29869
"40116","Veins of smoke and petrol thread through layers of pressed apple, pear and tangerine in this sprightly semi-dry Riesling. It's a delicately concentrated wine but bolstered by crisp lemon acidity and touches of bramble and spice. Drink now through 2019.","White","Riesling","US",40116
"52636","With only 56 cases imported, it may be a challenge to track down some of this full-bodied, slightly chunky Pinot Noir. The oak is a little too evident at this early stage, with toast and vanilla notes laying atop deeper notes of black cherries and spice, but give it 2–3 years and it shouldstart to sing.","Red","Pinot Noir","New Zealand",52636
"19444","There is an almost tropical touch to the apple and lemon fruit: this is almost like vanilla-spiced apple tart with lemon zest. Very appetizing with that unusual vanilla-edge and more of that tropical lychee. Overall, this is balanced and very fruit-driven.","White","Riesling","France",19444
"27386","This blends 51% Merlot with 29% Zinfandel, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah, combining nicely for a full-bodied expression of chocolate and dried dark cherry. On the palate, it becomes dusty and somewhat rustic, with an intensely juicy finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",27386
"21912","Toasted aromas come along with fragrances of espresso, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate delivers raw red cherry layered with mocha and coffee bean alongside astringent wood tannins that generate a drying, bitter finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",21912
"56134","Close in quality to Cabernets costing far more, this has elaborate blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. The all-important mouthfeel is dry and crisp, with fine tannins. It's not an ager, but shows plenty of class.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",56134
"106238","Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers. It's still a bit reserved.","Red","Syrah","US",106238
"98854","A terrific value, this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Mataro and 20% Shiraz features a forward bouquet of slightly jammy mixed berries. The palate showcases vibrant red fruit on a supple bed of tannins, capped off by a savory, tapanade-laden finish that makes it more than a simple fruit bomb. Very silky and drinkable, it's the ultimate wine-bar wine, as the name suggests.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","Australia",98854
"47038","A softly polished wine that's ready to enjoy soon, this shows classic aromas of black fruit, spice, tobacco leaf and underbrush. It has a delicious black-cherry flavor, punctuated with black pepper, clove and a hint of bitter almond.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",47038
"28809","Light and prickly in style, with citrus aromas along with tight cherry and plum scents. Runs lean in the mouth, with short, tart red fruit flavors in front of a crisp, sheer finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",28809
"19608","This is still rather closed, but eventually reveals aromas suggesting red berry, clove and a balsamic note that carry over to the bracing palate along with raspberry extract. It's tightly tannic, with an Amaretto-like finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",19608
"65267","Light, almost delicate wine, offering freshness, green fruits and a fine tangy texture. The citrus is prominent, but the wine as a whole is easy, fresh, developing quickly, touched finally with caramel.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",65267
"2198","The nose of this wine leads with forward oak and vanilla aromas. The palate offers more personality and ripe, luscious fruit flavors, with additional notes of spice and toast. While it shows some complexity, it's fast approaching its optimum drinking window, so enjoy soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",2198
"75457","This very tannic wine is fierce and astringent at this time. It's almost old-fashioned in its puckery dryness. True, it has a deep core of ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and cola flavors that could emerge after sufficient aging, but it's not a certainty.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",75457
"39180","Though very pale in the glass, this wine holds no shortage of interest. Honey and roasted marcona almonds consume the nose, and the palate blends bright citrus, lemon curd and cinnamon, all propped up by a perfect, judicious use of oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",39180
"19704","Chunky obtuse aromas of berry fruits are a bit damp and volatile. This is heavy and severely tannic, while blackened berry and prune flavors come across a bit stewed. A drawing tannic finish brings this to a close.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",19704
"5127","This blend of 55% Grenache Blanc, 26% Viognier and 19% Roussanne smells like golden sunshine, with aromas of hot beach sand, lemon pound cake and vanilla pudding. The palate shows pan-fried green apples, red apple flesh and fortune cookie flavors. It makes a good alternative for lighter Chardonnay lovers.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",5127
"1258","This wood aged Chenin Blanc has a strongly oxidative character. It has lost its fruit in favor of grilled almonds, toast and intense acidity. Drink this mature wine now.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",1258
"67201","Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 Gewürztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",67201
"56748","From grapes grown in Coombsville, this blends in tiny additions of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Earthy in leather and fresh compost, it remains light-bodied and dry, despite a large tannin presence, the finish marked by pencil shavings and herbs.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",56748
"75387","Made entirely from organic Sangiovese grapes, this opens with delicate red cherry and underbrush aromas. Ripe strawberry and raspberry lead the palate, revealing easygoing tannins. Enjoy soon.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",75387
"33191","Fuligni delivers a bright and sharp Brunello with medium build and tight forest berry aromas. The acidity leaves your mouth as clean as a whistle, and the wine imparts lingering tones of chopped mint, cola and dried ginger on the close.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",33191
"73248","Crunchy acidity marks this Viognier, giving it a palate brightness and making the apricot, tangerine, peach, pear and honeysuckle flavors finish drier than they probably really are. It's an exotic, rich wine that drinks well with Vietnamese fare, or a peanut-starring Cambodian beef or chicken dish.","White","Viognier","US",73248
"2633","Made with 50% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot, this has subdued aromas suggesting underbrush, clove, dark-skinned berry and French oak. The smooth vibrant palate delivers red currant, unripe cherry, mocha and dried sage alongside fine-grained tannins. An orange zest note closes the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",2633
"105513","Truffle, underbrush, mature plum, saddle leather and a balsamic note emerge on this robust red. The hearty, one-dimensional palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice and grilled herb alongside solid if not very persistent tannins. You'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the rather quick, drying finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",105513
"5142","Rich and structured, this is concentrated with tannins as well as generous sweet black fruits. The tannins and the accompanying acidity mean the wine should age. Drink now, although it will be better from 2016.","Port","Port","Portugal",5142
"4650","Comprised of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot, this is a juicy, savory and lengthy wine, with herbaceous elements of cedar, brush and peppercorn. A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",4650
"58327","With zesty acidity, this Pinot shows all the marks of a wine that wants two or three years in the cellar. Right now, it's delicately structured, dry and tart, with cranberry, sour cherry candy and ripe tomato flavors. A few years in the cellar will bring out a mushroomy earthiness that will make the wine extremely satisfying.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",58327
"78010","Aromas of green pepper, blackcurrant and toasted oak abound on this Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola blend. The polished, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, licorice and espresso alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",78010
"59873","Plum, toast, violet and savory herb aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. The tightly compacted palate delivers toasted oak, concentrated black cherry, dried sage, tobacco and licorice alongside a backbone of assertive tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",59873
"36541","Grapy aromas are spicy and woody. This is a full, packed truckload of a Malbec with earthy, baked flavors of blackberry and prune. Licorice and a mild blast of bitterness replace the wine's dark-fruit character on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",36541
"26374","Puckery lemon-lime acidity is a bright contrast to sweet honey tones on this medium-dry Riesling. Shades of dusty minerals lend a savory tone to ruddy apple and pear flavors on the palate.","White","Riesling","US",26374
"104545","A gold-colored wine, intensely sweet and with intense acidity. The combination gives a wine that is lemon and honey in a glass. There is a liquorous feel to the smooth texture. And it is still very young. Drink after 2017.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",104545
"83028","Here's a youthful Pinot Noir that tastes like it's still in the barrel. It's a bit heavy and very fruity, offering scads of red and black currants, cola, mocha, cedar and spice flavors. Could develop silkiness and complexity in the bottle after 2009.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83028
"91500","Brambly red-fruit aromas mix with notes of sweet milk chocolate and dust. It feels crisp, tight and fresh, with raspberry and lightly herbal plum flavors. This finishes taut and fruity. A blend of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",91500
"73295","Chardonnays from Mount Veeder are rare, but the mountain can be a good home for that variety. Godspeed's 2012 is dry, brisk in acidity and enormously rich in tropical fruit, pear and apricot fruit flavors, enhanced with oak. Drink this Chard now with fancy fare, such as wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tartare and chicken lasagna.","White","Chardonnay","US",73295
"28135","Pretty hibiscus nectar and lychee notes add an exotic twist to this dainty late-harvest Riesling. Light on its feet, it's deliciously juicy on the palate with showers of pink grapefruit and stone fruit. Finishes clean with a brisk, black tea note.","White","Riesling","US",28135
"91465","You'll find luxuriously ripe apricot, pineapple, white currant and peach flavors in this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Chardonnay. It's a bit stewed in fruit, though, and ready to drink now with sweetish fare.","White","White Blend","US",91465
"72439","Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",72439
"17069","This is a food-friendly Cab. It's made in an elegant style, with fine acidity and firm tannins that frame black and red currant, plum, mocha and cedar flavors. Lovely now, but so balanced, it should develop for ten years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",17069
"37251","Fresh scents of just-picked rose, bright red berry, baking spice, leather and an earthy hint of game unfold on this stunning wine. The full-bodied palate offers juicy mature cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, carob, chopped wild mint and clove alongside firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity. Gorgeous!","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",37251
"28462","It must be challenging to grow Pinot Noir in this warm region, but this bottling shows some promise. Raspberry fruit lingers behind tarry rubber and black olives scents, and the palate blends bitter and sour with a bit of spice, trending toward the forest-floor style with hints of pine, soy sauce and seared fruits.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28462
"39722","Here's a beautifully evolved Brunello with notes of cherry, cola and spice backed by dark and penetrating notes of blackberry, plum and tar. This wine delivers thick, solid aromas and a bold, succulent style with smooth softness and intensity in the mouth. Very nice.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",39722
"82369","This is the inaugural vintage of a new estate wine, from a 30-acre property on Eastside Road across the Russian River from the winery. Pear compote, anise and lemon candy wrap around voluptuous layers marked by green apple and orange peel, offering richness and weight in hearty measure.","White","Chardonnay","US",82369
"90633","This wine has both great richness and a cool, stylish side. It's structured, with a strong streak of minerality as well as as spice and pepper. It has a cool, restrained feel at the moment, waiting for the time to burst out with its complex structure. Hold at least until 2017.","White","Pinot Gris","France",90633
"75330","Deep, lavish and creamy aromas of fudge, espresso, cola, vanilla and perfectly ripe black currants and berrries greet the nose with measured force. The wine lands on the palate with aplomb, framed by silky yet grippy tannins and boasting flavors of espresso, dense blueberry, black peppercorn, bay leaf and pencil shavings. The woody angles will intensify with age; drink 2018–2032.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",75330
"70090","This pure, single vineyard Viognier enters the mouth rather soft and silky, with well-structured flavors of cantaloupe melon, grapefruit and pineapple. It shows good concentration, focus and length, and will age nicely for another five or six years.","White","Viognier","US",70090
"53729","Fully ripe, juicy pears glow from the core of this balanced, rounded wine, with an edge of marzipan, bitter almond and a wonderfully textured center. The palate is rich but dry and stays on the side of restraint, despite the fullness.","White","Pinot Gris","France",53729
"37712","Rich and flashy, from the get-go. It's dry and smooth, with fierce tannins giving a hit of astringency to the ripe, oaky black currant and crème de cassis flavors. Give it five years in the cellar to start to mellow.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",37712
"24710","Here's the quintessential Soave Classico that veers on the side of informality and easy-drinking appeal. The wine is redolent of white peach, citrus and Golden Delicious apple.","White","Garganega","Italy",24710
"42919","With 22 to 24 months in new French oak, there's a lot of richness to this wine in the form of raspberry sauce, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction. There's plenty of fruit to support those heavy flavors, though, with vibrant cherry and plum flavors in the medium weight mouth. Cola and spice add interest to the close.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",42919
"97472","Fulfills one of the main tenets of California Syrah, which is to feel velvety and vital in the mouth. The vineyard is better known as a source of Pinot Noir, and its cool-climate terroir lend brisk acidity, firm tannins and a cured meat note to the ripe blackberries and currants. Very delicious, and the price is great for the quality.","Red","Syrah","US",97472
"84168","Blended from several popular grape varieties, this wine tastes a tad tired and oxidized. The citrus and tropical fruit flavors are beginning to turn dried out and sherried. Drink up.","White","White Blend","US",84168
"51938","This is a full-bodied, rich and round Cabernet Sauvignon. Juicy, mouthwatering cassis fruit is framed by cedar, vanilla and baking spices, while the finish showcases fine tannins. Given the quality of this wine, it's a shame that Wynns' high-end john Riddoch Cab doesn't get exported to the U.S.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Australia",51938
"105161","This wine is partially barrel fermented and blended with a small amount of Sémillon. Herb, citrus and passion fruit aromas are followed by flavorful yet sleek tropical fruit notes that linger on the finish. It brings a whole lot of appeal.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",105161
"90318","This is all about rich, tarry red fruit flavors, layered with some dense fruit tannins. It's a warm wine from a hot place, concentrated and full. With flavors of superripe black fruits, this could be aged, but is definitely ready to drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",90318
"16653","This gentle, quaffable wine offers light flavors of strawberry and apple. There's generous acidity, and despite the fairly substantial alcohol, it's modest in its proportions.","Rosé","Rosé","US",16653
"87734","In terms of price, this wine can be considered the entry-level wine for the increasing range of Douro wines form this famed Port estate. This wine is all about fruit—bright red fruits—and just a touch of spice and toast from the wood aging. Drink the wine from early 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",87734
"40806","Savory, meaty aromas of leathery berry and spice are attractive and a touch woody.

A juicy, tight finish confirms that this is a very nice Malbec.","Red","Malbec","Chile",40806
"2332","Dusty, leesy aromas are powdery, with little fruit character. This feels stony on the surface but not deep. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish cidery and slightly bitter.","White","Albariño","Spain",2332
"4160","This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",4160
"15983","Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out. But for soft melon and pithy flavors, and the fact that it's made from the obscure Prensal and Muscat, we like it well enough.","White","White Blend","Spain",15983
"30644","Bright and crisp with clean, fresh flavors of apple and pear. It's got some pretty honeysuckle in both the nose and the mouth, and the overall texture, balance and length puts it in with some of Washington's best.","White","Riesling","US",30644
"18401","Gradations of textures ripple on the palate of this full-bodied dry Riesling. It's unctuously rich and fruity, full of ripe peach and honey flavors, while also elegant, struck by tones of steel and lemony acidity. A touch of saffron persists through a long, lingering finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",18401
"95000","Elegantly structured, this opens with aromas of underbrush, red berry, tobacco and savory herb. The linear palate offers bright red berry, crushed strawberry, licorice and cooking spice, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",95000
"101944","This is a creamy-textured Shiraz with mouthfilling flavors of brown sugar, blackberries, vanilla and a hint of peppery spice. It falls off a bit on the finish and doesn't seem to offer much in terms of ageability, but it tastes pretty darn good right now.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",101944
"100851","Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits. The wood aging is subtle, just a hint of smokiness and toast. This is one of those wines, from a great white wine vintage, that will age many years. Drink from 2024.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",100851
"93292","The '06 displays bright and crisp flavors of currant and cherry. Tannins are substantial, with a satisfying earthy streak underscoring notes of graphite and olive.

"98021","Sebastiani has had good results with their Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, and this bottling continues that tradition.

A wonderful wine for restaurants at a price that's affordable.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98021
"100584","Yellow fruit nuances abound in this slightly sweet-tasting offering from an area better known for growing Cabernet. Pear, pineapple and lemon aromas and flavors predominate, finishing with a bit of heat and slightly rough acids.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",100584
"53493","Jammy, gritty berry aromas set up a rubbery, full-force palate that doesn't tread lightly. Roasted, almost burnt black-fruit flavors finish firm. Overall, this feels right, while the flavors run a touch baked, rustic and stalky.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",53493
"86180","An ideal Italian whites to pair with spaghetti alle vongole or fried fish. The bouquet is redolent of almond paste, stone fruit and citrus. There's a very well-defined streak of sassy spice on the crisp finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",86180
"50497","An intense wine, its spice finely integrated with a more fruity character. It has the classic Gewürztraminer lychee flavor but this is balanced with acidity, ripe baked apple and mineral structure.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",50497
"5553","Red berry, spice and floral notes of rose and blue flower lead the nose on this wine. The palate delivers ripe red cherry and raspberry accented with thyme, sage and mint with hints of espresso and toast. Well balanced, it conveys just enough freshness and firm but fleeting tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",5553

"99030","The color of this very sweet wine is deep amber. Aromas are savory and rich, while flavors are unctuous and nutty. It's fun to drink, and tastes like a mature wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",99030
"87312","Interesting highlights of English Breakfast tea and toasted grains complement the strawberry fruit in this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 46% Malbec and 8% Syrah. Layered and complex, it shows pleasing hints of lightly composted earth.","Red","Red Blend","US",87312
"4024","Black cherry, black currant and spice notes are nicely integrated. This has a narrowly defined palate that sings of ripe fruit. Dark, toasty, slightly bitter blackberry is the core flavor on this oaky, peppery, voluminous Carmenère.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",4024
"6668","This vineyard, at 900 feet, gives a cool take on Chardonnay. It is tight, structured and mineral in character. Vanilla from the wood aging mingles with the taut citrus fruit. The richness will develop as the apricot flavors develop. Drink this fine wine from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",6668
"13880","You'll find an unusual note of freshly crushed black pepper in this Pinot Noir. Not overwhelming, but enough to vie with the cherries, cola and sandalwood. It's an excellent wine, dry and silky, although not on a par with the magnificent 2007.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",13880
"31969","The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",31969
"89545","Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",89545

"19425","Dark, ripe, tarry aromas announce a macho Malbec. This is jammy and pulpy in texture, with more than enough extraction. Herbal, woodsy black-fruit flavors are supported by an oaky, resiny finish with black-pepper spice notes. Drink through 2018.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",19425
"28602","Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.","White","White Blend","Spain",28602
"61994","Delicate whiffs of orange blossom and tangerine zest intensify on the palate of this off-dry Riesling. While racy and lithe in body, it penetrates on the palate with juicy white grapefruit and apricot notes.","White","Riesling","Germany",61994

"22436","Merlot makes up just over half of this wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon (39%) playing second fiddle and Cabernet Franc and Malbec rounding it out. It's expressive, with aromas of fig, golden raisins, eucalyptus and red fruit, with the aromas seeming slightly dried out. The palate is fruit forward and textured, while still showing restraint and length.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",22436
"81177","Tremendous concentration is evident right from the start. The deep color and intense black cherry and blackberry fruit start it off. Streaks of tar and red licorice power through a mouth-filling midpalate and into a finish with exceptional length and balance. Drink now through 2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81177
"71285","Very fruity in flavor and smooth in texture, this Rhône-style blend of 67% Grenache with Mourvèdre and Syrah is easy to enjoy. It is full-bodied, feels rich and mouth-filling on the palate and remains light in tannins and acidity.","Red","Red Blend","US",71285
"32188","Vanilla and banana jelly, manuka honey and muscovado sugar—layer upon layer of fruity sweetness with tropical overtones of pineapple is revealed on the luscious palate. Such liveliness is engendered here with a seemingly endless finish. A total triumph.","White","White Blend","Austria",32188
"4593","Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new. The wine would benefit from a firmer texture, though, as it's on the soft, one-dimensional side.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",4593
"47889","Ripe notions of juicy pear and hay flowers have a lovely zesty edge on the nose. The palate confirms this with concentrated counterpoints of honeyed fruit and bright citrus zestiness. This is full on and rich, and a touch of residual sweetness gives this extra heft and conviction. It is the citrus freshness that provides structure and direction. The finish is merely off dry, so this will shine alongside various dishes. Drink 2017–2025.","White","Pinot Gris","France",47889
"25739","Aged for 14 months in wood, this wine is smoothly structured and offers considerable dark fruits and rich tannins. It has power and concentration from the texture and the fruit. It is an ageworthy wine from a great estate. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",25739
"84079","Radiant and structured, this is initially closed but slowly opens to reveal engaging aromas of woodland berry, violet, star anise, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note. The vibrant, full-bodied palate boasts great energy while offering layers of wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and licorice. Bright acidity and firm, polished tannins provide balance. Give it time to fully develop. Drink between 2020 and 2035.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",84079
"98019","Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades. Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015–2025.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",98019
"91213","Racy, zesty aromas of honey and squeezed orange form the nose of this still-tight wine, a blend of 62% Grenache Blanc and 38% Rousanne from a vineyard at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The crisp palate offers pear and apple cider flavors with a finish of honeydew melon. A perfect pairing for halibut and shellfish.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",91213
"7387","Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea.

"70928","This unusual Oregon Malbec carries intense, rustic aromas mixing plum, grape, spice and saddle leather. Despite its very tight tannins, the wine tastes open and grapey, reminiscent of a Washington Lemberger, though not quite as soft.","Red","Malbec","US",70928
"59598","The Riesling and Gewürztraminer grapes used to make this Alsace-like blend were harvested late to allow for concentrated sweetness. It has a perfumed character and a steely edge of acidity. The finish hints at honey, and it has a crisp texture.","White","White Blend","Portugal",59598
"49283","Heat and power emerge immediately from the nose of this slightly brownish Montepulciano. Dig deep and you'll find prunes, blackberry, tobacco and resin. The wine is simple overall with gritty tannins.","Red","Montepulciano","Italy",49283
"7307","All the proper structure of young Gevrey-Chambertin with the addition of rich, generous fruit. The core is of wood and dry fruit tannins, the fruit of rich black plum juice. At this stage, the wine is firm. Give it 5–6 years to open up.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",7307
"53277","Electric pink in color, this brings wild strawberry, cherry, watermelon and spice aromas. The palate is broad and heavy, lacking lift.","Red","Sangiovese","US",53277
"81860","This is pretty good Cab at a fair price. It's rich with sun-ripened cherry pie, blueberry jam and mocha flavors, along with firm yet supple tannins. Drink this wine with beef stew.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",81860

"75034","Pretty in honeysuckle and gardenia, this bright wine, blended with 5% Sémillon, recalls fresh-squeezed lemonade before the sugar, refreshing and intensely delicious. The acidity is balanced by enough weight to dial the volume down and flavors of rich, lush melon.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",75034
"93226","This is a ripe, full wine that has firm tannins and a smooth texture from the Aragon (Tempranillo) in the blend. It is full of ripe berry fruits, along with attractive acidity. Spice and toast finish this attractive wine. Drink starting now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",93226
"52098","This is lightly herbal and beautifully complex. The fruit is a sweetly ripe mix of boysenberry and blueberry, notched with highlights of pepper and leaf. Everything is supported with perfectly proportioned acids and fine-tuned tannins.","Red","Syrah","US",52098
"41876","A rich nose of cloves, exotic spice and tobacco give this red a distinctive edge. The palate offers pronounced allspice and tobacco, touched by sweet oak, tea and red fruit. A good everyday wine with an exotic touch.","Red","Red Blend","Greece",41876

"2204","This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",2204
"88139","From one of the cooler sites sourced by the producer, this wine is remarkably rich and foreboding, sultry in chalky tannin and lingering blueberry and blackberry notes. Deeply satisfying and complex, it's structured and firm, with a sizable presence of toasty oak and a jolt of dark-roast coffee at the end.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",88139
"69356","Penetrating flavors of preserved peach and honey are nuanced by layers of saffron, pollen and high-toned acidity in this sun-kissed auslese. It's delicate in body, yet concentrated in flavor and ripples of sweet nectar seem to amble endlessly on the finish. Gorgeous now, but should develop well for decades to come.","White","Riesling","Germany",69356
"62967","Deep blackberry syrup, chipped slate and sharp black-plum skins show on the nose of this bottling. The tannins are very chalky and a bit overwhelming on the palate at first, but then open to reveal zesty but dense blackberry fruit and a touch of peppercorn. A solid choice now, it will be even better in a couple years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",62967
"100509","Winemaker Randy Lewis made this wine, a showstopper in fleshy texture and supportive oak. Characteristics of charcuterie and spicy apple pie combine in a complex tension of savory and richly layered concentration, leaving a memorable impression as it traffics in nutmeg on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",100509

"62390","Beeswax and dried chamomile flowers, baked apple and lanolin, lemon rind and a touch of honey: while these aromas are rich on the nose, they become even more bountiful on the palate, filling mouth and mind with their high-wire acrobatics that teeter between steely precision and decadent richness. This late harvest style shows off Riesling's aromatics to great effect. The finish is incredibly zesty and fresh. While this is already evolved, it shows no signs of tiredness and is sure to delight for years to come. Concentration and balance are phenomenal. The haunting aroma of lanolin gets under your skin. Drink now through 2030.","White","Riesling","France",62390
"67100","Saintsbury brings a Pinot Noir-like touch to this Syrah. It's silky and transparent, with an elegant mouthfeel, but shows Syrah's weight and depth, with blackberry, blueberry, leather and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",67100

"46060","From the producer's family estate site planted in 1982 on Eastside Road, this is a nuanced elegant expression of the variety, earthy and pungent in baked bread. Baked plum, strawberry and dried herb are accented by forest floor and a rich hit of maple.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",46060
"100147","Though the aromas of orange and apple blossom, honey and peach extract feign a touch of sweetness, this wine's steely minerality belies such a conclusion. And so does the palate, where a lemonade acidity and wet slate element cut clean through fresh apples and pear flesh, revealing that it's not sweet at all.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",100147
"90513","This bottling is extremely chalky on the nose, with white rock aromas dusting its Asian pear, buttercream and grapefruit pith scents. The palate is tense and Chablis-like in style, offering lemon pith and sour orange rind flavors that settle into more lavish almond cream tones on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",90513
"19960","This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove. This is toasty on the finish, which has drying tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",19960
"8070","This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5–7 years' aging.","White","Chardonnay","France",8070
"68922","Bacon aromas and very dense tannins give this a lean, rather than fruity, character. It does have some density along with a more juicy black-fruit finish, although high amounts of toast also show strongly.","Red","Merlot","France",68922
"23057","An intense portrait of Napa Cabernet, bursting in red cassis, plum and herbes de Provence, this is a balanced, softly layered wine with well-managed tannins. The time in French oak has provided structure as well as power. Toying for more time in bottle, it should be enjoyed through 2022–2027.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",23057
"3549","VillaBella delivers a generous Amarone from the Classico zone with loads of spice and characteristic blackberry and cherry fruit. On the one hand, the wine tastes a bit overripe with strawberry marmalade. On the other, the firm tannins and natural freshness keep it in check. Age this wine another five years.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",3549
"62052","This is too oaky, with dominating aromas and flavors of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla. The oak-derived tannins are discernable, but the underlying wine is dry and crisp, with flavors of raspberries and cherries. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",62052
"3128","A rather pungent, slightly sweaty nose presages a wine that offers loads of passion fruit flavor. While it lacks a bit of dimension and complexity, this medium-bodied offering will work fine alongside citrusy ceviches and the like.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",3128
"24220","Compared to this estate's Rosé de 1ère Taille, there's not that much to distinguish it. It may be a little rounder and fuller, a little more fruit-forward and less elegant, but it shares the primary notes of crushed stone, citrus and a refreshing brine-like minerality.","Rosé","Rosé","France",24220
"79905","A crushed carnation aroma accents the ripe fruit core of strawberry, raspberry and mango on this selection. The palate is juicy and fruit forward, with red berry flavors, medium acidity and a subtle earthy spice that unfolds on the finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",79905
"70901","A fairly coarse wine, thin in texture and tart, with unbalanced green peppercorn, mint, berry and cola flavors. Syrah, Mourvèdre, Grenache and Counoise.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",70901
"58694","An ambitious Cabernet that's part of Raymond's program of highlighting individual appellations within Napa Valley. This wine is delicious, exhibiting rich, deep flavors of black currants with tasteful accents of oak. While it's fine to drink now, the tannins and long finish suggest up to eight years in the cellar will be beneficial.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",58694
"100242","Light and fresh, with modest grapefruit flavors matched by herbal notes and some flowery aromatics. Probably best as an apéritif. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",100242
"49685","Aromas of spicy plum and black cherry lead the nose. On the fresh, savory palate, accents of white pepper and clove add depth to layers of ripe, red berry. Supple tannins support the juicy fruit flavors.","Red","Barbera","Italy",49685
"51374","Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, which is dominated by toothpicky vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Underneath is a fine, crisp wine, with tangerine and sweet Meyer lemon flavors.","White","Chardonnay","US",51374
"103957","Aromas of white peach and honeysuckle yield to flavors of grapefruit, peach, jasmine and orange blossom. This wine is smooth in the mouth and the zesty finish is characterized by lingering floral flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Morocco",103957
"92025","This wine is tangy and cool in character. Red fruits are poised, reflecting the light color of the wine. Fresh and crisp, this is ready to drink.","Rosé","Rosé","France",92025
"5175","A smoky wine with black currant flavors that bring together spice and fruitiness. The wine has a light touch, licorice and stalky tannins ending with attractive juiciness. It is ready to drink.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",5175
"57827","From a vineyard within the Santa Rosa Plains, this wine opens in pretty, floral aromas of violet and gentle rose. Seductive, it follows with bursts of blood orange and wild strawberry that remain faint and delicate on the palate, light and clear in color, and elegant in intensity. Still, there's enough backbone to the wine to keep it fresh and alive through the long finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57827
"10828","This is a crisp, fresh and fruity wine. With its sliced apple, pink grapefruit and lemon-zest texture, it has both fruitiness and a hint of minerality from the schist of the Douro. Drink now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",10828
"875","This wine's enticing rose, blue flower, menthol and herb scents come together in the glass. On the taut, precise palate, tightly knit, refined tannins enwrap crunchy red cherry and juicy cranberry flavors. White pepper and clove notes add depth, while bright acidity lends balance. Drink 2023–2035.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",875
"63703","Sweet, verging on honeyed, this lush wine features plenty of superripe apples balanced by just a dash of citrus and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Could use more complexity.","White","Riesling","Germany",63703
"1778","Slightly sweet and quite light in body, this wine has modest peach and herb aromas, generic fruit flavors and a soft texture.","White","Riesling","US",1778
"65160","The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",65160
"92140","The lighter-style nose that focuses on red plum and cherry is a welcome change from all of the heavy Malbecs out there, but the wine doesn't follow through on the palate. It becomes astringent, with tastes of tomato, stewed berry and cranberry.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",92140
"14276","Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Gris, this is fine and delicate, with citrus, flower, vanilla, smoke and doughy yeast flavors that finish crisp and dry. Drink now.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",14276
"247","Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",247
"103932","This blend of 70% Blaufränkisch, 20% Pinot Noir and 10% Zweigelt has aromas of cranberry, pomegranate and dried cherry with flavors of blackberry and red raspberry. There's a pleasant touch of spicy black pepper in the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Slovenia",103932
"68052","Stéphane Brocard is based in Marsannay the northernmost vineyard in Burgundy's Côte d'Or. This wine comes from two small parcels with 35-year-old vines. It is already fruity and attractive, although the tannins do promise aging. Crisp with the pure acidity of the vintage, it will develop well and should be drunk from late 2017.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",68052
"64356","This wine is crisp, full of red apple and green-plum flavors, with a touch of minerality in the tangy texture. From chalky soil, it is tight and bright with lively acidity. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","France",64356
"82455","Charming aromas of tobacco leaf and strawberries promise good things to come but the palate does not follow through. While some boysenberry flavors appeal, the wine is thin in the mouth. The tannins are a bit overly gripping now but the wine does not have the fruit ripeness or concentration to benefit from cellaring.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",82455
"16888","This robust Zin is meaty in Italian sausage aromas, with streaks of cedar and dark plum intertwined throughout. Balanced in terms of acidity and weight, it finishes in a generous helping of leathery tannins and oak.","Red","Zinfandel","US",16888
"30415","This is Marimar's unoaked Chardonnay from the estate vineyard. In keeping with past vintages, it's so rich and savory, you won't even notice the absence of barrel influence. The wine is rich and complex in tangerine, apricot, lime, lemon and vanilla flavors, brightened by exquisite acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",30415
"106236","Fully ripe fruit flavors are accented by light toast and spice notes in this full-bodied and extremely smooth-textured wine. Dense ripe blackberry and dark chocolate flavors seem to coat the palate, and moderate tannins provide good grip.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",106236
"68276","Rock-solid aromas of toasty oak, black fruits and leather are textbook for Ribera del Duero. This is structurally sound, with deep earthy blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors that announce quality wood work. A long warm toasty finish means this ends as well as it opens. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",68276
"54052","A rich gold color and spicy, complex aromas get this wine off to a great start. It follows with ginger, cinnamon, baked apple and lemon on the palate, which sets up a layered flavor profile supported by fine bubbles and fresh acidity. The finish lingers on slightly nutty and doughy notes. Enjoy through 2022.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",54052
"16945","This is a mint- and licorice-flavored wine, with its wood aging prominent at this stage. Full bodied, rich and concentrated, it shows strong signs of extraction that give it a bitter finish. Age this tannic wine for 2–3 years or more.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",16945
"105825","Slightly gritty dusty aromas are low on fruit. This feels plump and round, with modest acidity. Simple melon and mild citrus flavors finish with pyrazine-driven notes of bell pepper and jalapeño.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",105825
"18870","Unoaked Chardonnays can be fairly neutral, but this one is anything but. Creamy and textural, it's laced with mixed flavors of grapefruit, gooseberry, lime and lemon zest. Delicious on its own, or pair it with gently seasoned seafood or poultry.","White","Chardonnay","US",18870
"6376","Light and spicy, this wine surprises and delights. It shows a tannic underbrush of firmness and grit that's seasoned in tart acidity and flavors of rhubarb, currant and black tea. It's well balanced and enjoyable now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6376
"13914","This is a beautiful Zinfandel. It exhibits all the wild, exotic forest berry-cherry flavors you could want, flooded with briary spices and notes of currants and mint that go on forever in the finish. Yet it also has Napa's perfect tannins and the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon. First-class Zin, a chef's dream to play with.","Red","Zinfandel","US",13914
"94882","From a cooler section of the Napa Valley, this Chardonnay offers simple, crisp and creamy aromas and flavors of apple and pear, toasty oak and vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",94882
"13671","This is a thick and savory wine, compressed and somewhat flabby on the palate. A curious nose takes time to develop into full-bodied black cherry and blackberry.","Red","Grenache","US",13671
"19910","This wine is still coming out of its shell, with lightly reduced aromas of mandarin orange, fresh flowers, and citrus. It drinks bone dry, with silky-feeling fruit flavors providing intrigue but not entirely delivering. The aromas and flavors don't seem to match up.","White","Riesling","US",19910
"82258","This intense wine opens with an alluring fragrance of crushed flower, vineyard dust, bright berry, leather, cooking spices and balsamic notes. The structured palate delivers ripe black cherry, prune, cracked black pepper, toast and licorice alongside vibrant acidity. The fruit richness stands up to the assertive tannins but it ends on a mouth-drying finish. Drink 2020–2040.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",82258
"30862","Bright and juicy, this is a fresh, red-fruited wine, ripe and fragrant. The tannic element is almost an afterthought.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",30862
"8616","From an estate in Rutherford that can't be named, this delightfully balanced Cab offers succulent plum, black olive, raspberry and cinnamon to great effect, melding the myriad sides of its personality well. Integrated oak and a medium-weight body allow the wine to breathe and expand on the palate, finishing in dust.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",8616
"37508","Brown pear, banana and gooey cherimoya aromas show in this blend of 36% Marsanne, 33% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay and 6% Viognier. A beeswax element comes through on the palate, but the treacly, tropical flavors predominate. A decent acidity keeps it all in check.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",37508
"57353","Herbaceousness marks this wine, which doesn't seem to be ripe enough. True, there are some pretty black-cherry and chocolate notes in the aroma that carry through in the mouth. But it drinks thin, although not rough, and there's a green chlorophyll note that no amount of aging will get rid of.","Red","Merlot","US",57353
"3641","This ripe wine is already delicious with its full, bold fruits and peach and mango flavors. It's full of rich fruits and touched lightly by spice. Drink this generous wine from 2018.","White","Chardonnay","France",3641
"12376","Tasted alongside far more expensive Napa Cabs, this one held its own proudly. It shows impressive blackberry, currant and mint flavors, with a smoky, ashy overlay of oak. The firm tannins suggest modest ageability. Drink this dry, balanced Cab now through 2010.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",12376
"86363","Defines Carneros in its rich, nuanced aromas of fig, ripe peach, tangerine, nutmeg and oaky vanilla. Winemaker-induced complexities from barrel fermentation and lees aging. Tremendous depth of flavor, it just sings on the palate and is so rich and spicy. The ultralong finish is sweet and satisfying.","White","Chardonnay","US",86363
"68300","Barolo Leon makes a wonderful first impression thanks to its aromas of ripe berry fruit, Indian spice, cola, licorice and ginger. There's deep dimension and personality here and the wine ends with firmly polished tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",68300
"10801","Smoky, rubbery aromas run alongside berry and plum scents. This is full, loamy and soft in feel. Flavors of berry and cassis are short yet ripe and earthy, while the finish is mellow and easygoing.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",10801
"95337","Late disgorged, this wine combines 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay from the vintage, exploding in well-honed, equal flavors of strawberry and white peach. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh and lively as it builds toward a dry, lemony finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",95337
"45733","This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",45733
"87570","Toast aromas accent ripe pears and golden-delicious apples in this soft, easy-to-like Chard that only lacks a bit of depth. A slightly bitter note on the finish should become less noticeable over the next few months.","White","Chardonnay","US",87570
"36994","Big, tough, gutsy, fruity, tannic. In other words, Petite Sirah, and classic at that. Shows very ripe, deep and long-lasting flavors of blackberries, blueberries, currants, chocolate, cedar and spices, in a bone-dry, full-bodied red wine. Good now, and should develop over a decade.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",36994
"85991","This easy-to-drink blend of 50% Shiraz, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot starts off jammy, with black cherry liqueur and clove notes before settling down and developing some interesting peach and mocha nuances. The persistent finish, lined with velvety tannins, makes it stand out from the crowd. Best Buy. —J.C.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",85991
"57171","This rather deeply hued, yellow-gold wine offers aromas suggesting orchard fruit, toasted almond and crushed rock. The palate shows tart apple and green pear accompanied by vibrant acidity.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",57171
"76424","Leg of lamb with a rosemary-garlic marinade and white beans would pair nicely with this darkly concentrated wine. This is a thick, savory expression that offers loads of ripe fruit and prune flavors, with spicy notes of teriyaki and hickory smoke.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",76424
"45713","Bright, appley aromas and ripe apple and peach flavors make this light-bodied wine fresh and appealing. It tastes slightly off dry, with an engagingly smooth texture.","White","Riesling","US",45713
"2031","This very complete wine offers dark tannins, ripe berry fruits and a velvet texture. It's rich, relying on blackberry and black plum flavors and a dense structure. Mouth-filling, it delivers delicious fragrant acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",2031
"65947","There's a wild array of aromas to this appellation blend, including wild mint and huckleberries. It's bright red fruit at first sip, then the wine downshifts into cloves, wet asphalt and anise. A direct but clean and very appealing selection, ready for enjoyment now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",65947
"89440","This is a strongly flavored Cabernet. It has upfront blackberry and red cherry jam flavors, with some sweet spicy notes from French oak barrels. It's not a wine you want to age, but is smooth and flattering now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89440
"98782","With fresh, pure fruit flavors, great balance and very full body, this wine will be great at the table. It has a dry but velvety feel, moderate tannins and good acidity, all of which lift up the great cherry and boysenberry nuances and give an overall impression of freshness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",98782
"25769","Dry and withered, with green, minty tartness. Offers hints of red cherries, although oak adds sweeter notes of vanilla and smoke.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",25769
"88633","Aromas of black-olive juice, animal hide and seashell fail to offer much fruit, even with swirling. A tough palate shows no clear point of entry, while herbal black-fruit flavors draw in rather than expand on the finish. This is a Syrah-led blend with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Graciano, aka Tintilla de Rota. It hails from Cádiz.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",88633
"36649","The Encruzado and Malvasia blend is both fruity and intensely perfumed. It has a touch of lychee as well as crisper grapefruit. Drink the wine starting now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",36649
"5751","Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",5751
"35560","Rustic, earthy aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by dark tannins and bitter chocolate flavors. That leaves little room for the rich berry fruits that are struggling to come through. Allow time for this toughness and firm extraction to soften. Drink from 2016.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",35560
"94393","Light in color and sizzling in Asian spice, this wine is made by Sam Spencer from a variety of top-notch vineyard sites, including Durell and Wildcat Canyon, as well as locales farmed by the Sangiacomos. Light to medium in body, it features soft texture and well-integrated oak. An element of exotic Mediterranean spice never quite lets go atop the black cherry and strawberry notes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",94393
"79933","Zesty blackberry and boysenberry are lifted by white pepper and a touch of thyme on this wine's deep and dark yet fresh nose. Steadily growing acidity frames the palate, where flavors of wet clay and olallieberry paste dominate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",79933
"78263","The nectarine and mild vanilla aromas are subdued yet solid. On the palate, it's all about stone fruit flavors, such as peach and nectarine, with apple and cider notes on the balanced and healthy finish.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",78263
"63605","Understated stone fruit and mineral flavors dominate the palate, with peach-pit and citrus notes on the finish. Round and resinous in the mouth; nose offers a white peppery, plasticy bite.","White","Riesling","Australia",63605
"68035","Just two barrels were made, from a mix of Syrah and Pinot Noir. It's a pale, pretty rosé, with flavors of watermelon and strawberry, and good concentration through the mid-palate.","Rosé","Rosé","US",68035
"33915","This wine just bowls you over from the first sniff, a lush mix of white flower and citrus-rind aromatics. It's precise and penetrating, leading into a thoroughly captivating palate of sharply defined grapefruit, peach and papaya, underscored by racy minerality.","White","Viognier","US",33915
"64130","This lightly cloudy wine displays aromas of orange marmalade, candied pear and citrus peel. Honeyed dried apple and pear flavors display exquisite balance and length.","White","Riesling","US",64130
"80203","This blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot seems slightly muddled, with notes of dried herbs, flowers, barrel spices and plum. Flavors are soft and chocolaty, with an elegant styling and grainy tannins.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",80203
"71516","Attractive and layered with a blueberry and raspberry fruit core accented by notes of sweet spice, orange oil, ashy tobacco and a touch of dark purple florals. The gripping tannins are fine and balanced, with skin-driven fruit flavors dominating the palate and a fudgy chocolate and sweet spice note lingering on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Israel",71516
"70774","Smoke and pressed apple notes are savory on the nose, but the palate of this zesty off-dry Riesling is fresh with sweet-tart peach and honeydew. It's refreshing and straightforward in style, but finishes with lingering mineral complexities.","White","Riesling","Germany",70774
"4861","Smells like wet dog, with sweaty red fruit. The palate is high in acid and low in volume, with snappy, semisour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Settles on the finish but still it's sharp and lean. 80% Tempranillo and 20% Malbec.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",4861
"67018","This stalky, tight wine has a smoky character, lean black-currant fruits and a tough, possibly unripe fruitiness. It is developing fast, drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",67018
"82982","From vineyards at 400 to 1,800 feet in elevation, this wine opens with an intensely aromatic nose of honey and caramel. Sultry and seductive, with full-bodied fruit concentration, it emanates spicy fig, pear and quince, finishing bright with stony minerality.","White","Chardonnay","US",82982
"60735","The dark color and heady aroma of crushed ripe plums suggest this wine's size, an impression confirmed when you take a sip. It's a big wine, extracted in cherry and raspberry jam, with hints of orange rind, anise liqueur, white pepper and smoky oak. The vineyard is in the emerging Petaluma Gap region. Drink now–2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60735
"82647","There is plenty of color and extract in this tannic wine. Blackberry fruit is at the core, and though aged in one third new oak, it is not evident in the flavors. A balanced and beautifully proportioned wine, which accurately captures the AVA's strengths.","Red","Merlot","US",82647
"103508","Comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend displays ripe, round, flavorful fruit, along with a leafy component. The barrel aging has added butterscotch and chocolate notes to the mix. The wine stops just a bit short, but further bottle age may help to lengthen the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",103508
"102434","Spicy and woody, with a pungency on the nose. The round palate is full of red-berry fruit and a fair amount of supporting oak. That wood is confirmed on the finish, where things turn a bit buttery and rich. Fortunately some lively tannins and cleansing acids keep things from getting bogged down. A good everyday Cab. Best Buy.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",102434
"78824","This is unusual in that it's heavily oaked, as evidenced by aromas of varnish, hard spice and resin. The mouthfeel is fresh on top of resiny, while flavors of dry oak, spice and mild apple and citrus operate in the background. While this wine has depth of body and acidic lift, it's dominated by the barrel.","White","White Blend","Spain",78824
"59996","There are brambly, wild cherry aromas and flavors in this wine, as well as a little cocoa, but this Sierra Foothills Zin is still fairly tight and hard to tell which direction it will go from here. A majority (80%) Zin, there's also 20% Syrah that was cofermented with Viognier in the blend.","Red","Zinfandel","US",59996
"54401","Fans of New Zealand's SBs will like this wine's racy nose, which is packed with minerals, some stoniness, melon, and a hint of grassiness. Citrus is in full force in the mouth, aided by a touch of green herbs and a white-pepper spice. The finish is elegant and offers hints of grapefruit. It's a youthful, fresh wine; one that will go well with salads or fish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",54401
"81691","This is made in a deeper, richer style than this producer's nonvintage. It has weight and concentration, and its acidity is balanced by the ripe orange and red apple flavors that are cut by a steely edge. On the finish, acidity and fruit come deliciously together.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",81691
"43764","This cool-vintage Syrah is lightly herbal and complex up front, with blueberry and boysenberry aromas. Compact and tight in the mouth, this is firm and shows no leaks or weak spots. Herbal plum and berry flavors finish toasty, and the overall feel is firm, serious and in balance. Drink through 2015.","Red","Syrah","Chile",43764
"106240","Produced by the winemaking team of Casa Santos Lima in Lisboa, this wine has rich black fruits and a soft texture. Its depth, concentration and richness are finely integrated—full and fruity with a core of firmer tannins. Drink now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",106240
"45299","Ripe red fruits give this wine a juicy feel. The fruit is balanced, with new wood and caramel flavors offering a smooth contrast to each other. The smoky aftertaste is warm and ripe.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",45299
"105296","Underbrush, coconut, espresso and floral aromas lead the nose. It's full-bodied but lean in terms of fruit richness, offering exotic spice, roasted coffee bean and a hint of licorice while aggressive grainy tannins leave a mouth-drying astringent finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",105296
"43954","From Stonetree vineyard, this tightly styled Syrah offers white pepper laced into plummy fruit. There's a pretty floral/violet streak, and also darker notes of tar and smoke, suggesting some coiled power behind the rather light front end.","Red","Syrah","US",43954
"46316","Juicy and fruity, this has apple and lemon flavors that combine with a steely edge. It's refreshing and crisp, with a bright, lively character, and a tang on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","France",46316
"40134","Made from red grape Nero d'Avola vinified without skin contact, this full-bodied wine has sensations of red apples, pink grapefruit, mineral and white pepper. Crisp acidity gives freshness but the warmth of evident alcohol on the midpalate throws off the balance.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",40134
"73516","This murky fortified wine pushes some blackberry fruit forward. The liquorous brandy flavors come up strongly, and the wine finishes with flavors of dried leaves.","Red","Tempranillo","US",73516
"80435","Lots of rich flavors in this affordably priced Chard. It brims with golden mango, orange jam, buttercream, butterscotch, glazed donut and caramel flavors, finished with zesty acidity.","White","Chardonnay","US",80435
"45917","This wine is showing excessive oakiness at the moment, but it's so young that it could easily meld into the fruit with another few months in the bottle. Sharp and youthful, it has some real fruit power from the Gamache vineyard grapes. Apple and citrus rind dominate, with a touch of butter in the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",45917
"68830","Fresh key lime aromas meet sweeter tangerine and floral scents on the nose of this single vineyard bottling. The acidity is punchy on the palate, with tangy green fruit flavors that recall Anjou pear and lime skins.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",68830
"81377","Made with 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Pinot Nero, this savory sparker offers aromas and flavors of wild cherry, juicy strawberry, orange zest and a hint of cake spice. Fresh acidity and a vibrant but refined perlage provide the backdrop.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Italy",81377
"51984","The 2012 vintage was a cool one in Marlborough, and it shows in this wine, especially when compared to the fine, elegant 2013 Te Koko. This is grassy and herbal, even hinting a bit at green peas, yet still offers a compelling texture and ample length. It may even outlive the 2013, even if it doesn't quite reach the same heights.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",51984
"79347","The wine balances the sweet spiciness of Gewurztraminer with a good level of acidity. That gives the wine a light touch while allowing the rose and bergamot character of the grape to shine through. The wine is ready to drink.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",79347
"76505","While dainty in structure, this light-footed Riesling is intense and concentrated, with ripe stone-fruit and tangerine flavors. Nervy lemon-lime--like acidity and shades of slate and steel add depth and balance.","White","Riesling","US",76505
"13832","Herbal aromas of olive and eucalyptus are stronger than the wine's briary berry scents. Herbal berry flavors are savory and feature a lot of olive, while a roasted meat note is the closing act.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",13832
"14808","When some of the greatest Cahors weigh in at 13.5% alcohol, there is no need for this 15.5% monster. It's a shame, because there is much to admire here, with the powerful bitter chocolate and the sweetest berry fruits, a wall of polished concentration. It needs aging for four years at least.","Red","Malbec","France",14808
"69602","An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.","White","Verdejo","Spain",69602
"23870","Hints of spice and pollen add dimension to ripe peach, apple and honey notes on this decadent but composed Riesling. It's lip-smackingly sweet on the attack, but sharp, steely acidity and hints of tea leaf extend long on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",23870
"31671","Aromas of dark berry, licorice and chopped herb lead the nose. The structured palate offers red and black cherry, clove, tobacco and a hint of orange zest alongside firm, ripe tannins. Drink 2018–2024.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",31671
"24305","This wine is comprised of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Dusty earthiness frames its green, vegetal flavors, wrapped in ripe, sturdy tannins and bitter leather and clove notes.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",24305
"30395","With 35% Sauvignon Gris in the blend, this wine is attractive to drink now. Perfumed white fruits with hints of apricots—it's lively and light.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",30395
"66675","This is an outstanding value in a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir—soft, subtle and spicy, with sweet strawberry and cherry fruit. All neutral oak fermented, the mouthfeel is smooth and supple, and the flavors have a sexy, delicious quality that says “drink me now!”","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66675
"59861","Unlike most Dolcettos, this is laid back; it doesn't announce itself with a great blast of fruit. Instead it offers a package of spices and blackberry jam throughout the palate. No great intensity here but there is an easy elegance to the wine, culminating in a solid, medium finish.","Red","Dolcetto","Italy",59861
"49591","Leather, truffle, ripe berry and a whiff of oak-derived spice lead the nose of this 100% Sangiovese wine. The taut palate delivers mature plum, black cherry and licorice flavors, its fine-grained tannins leaving a firm, dry finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",49591
"38562","From a selection of vines, this is a powerful, complex wine that boasts ripe tannins, sweet acidity and a juicy black currant character. It has structure and density that certainly indicate aging, so keep the wine for at least five years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",38562
"9101","Made by legendary Steve Clifton for a property owner just west of Happy Canyon, this wine shows pure purple fruit aromas of blackberry syrup and blueberry, enhanced by a sprig of spearmint. The palate offers red cherry, boysenberry and lighter blueberry fruit, with a splash of milk chocolate, fudge and dark gravel notes completing the layers.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",9101
"74394","This wine is very ripe and jammy in aroma, and delicious like fresh blackberries in flavor. Full bodied, it's almost sweet and very smooth in texture. Made with the Lodi Native hands-off winemaking protocols, it's as close to pure, beautiful fruitiness as a wine gets.","Red","Zinfandel","US",74394
"93508","A lightly herbaceous aroma and bright citrus flavors make this light-bodied wine fresh and easy to drink. It smells like fresh-cut grass and lemon, tastes like grapefruit and honeydew melon, and feels soft and smooth.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",93508
"39291","Tastes soft and high in alcohol, with flavors of chocolate, cherry pie filling and spice. An appealing wine that's for drinking now.","Red","Red Blend","US",39291
"93586","Here's a very elegant and ethereal expression of Nebbiolo with measured aromatic accents of drying mineral, wild berries and Indian spice. This is a delicate and feminine wine with freshness, tartness and a very fine quality of tannin.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",93586
"54080","Crisp and compact, the 2011 Diana Madeline undoubtedly needs at least another couple of years in the cellar. The nose is leafy and herbal, but the flavors show cherry fruit framed by subtle shadings of vanilla. The tannins are firm, imparting a drying sensation to the long finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Australia",54080
"96396","Here's a vibrantly fruity, fresh young wine. It's light in texture and silky, with crisp, lip-smacking flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, cola, clove and cinnamon. Delicious now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",96396
"48516","Fresh-squeezed grapefruit, pomelo, Key lime, lemongrass, green papaya and Anjou pear combine for a very green, fruit-driven nose on this bottling from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach. The palate is a tad ripe but shows apple soda, lime juice, cherimoya and apple-custard flavors.","White","Albariño","US",48516
"63467","Here's a rich and enjoyable Pinot Grigio with natural aromas of cantaloupe, almond nut and passion fruit. The wine is clean and light in the mouth and does a good job of keeping the palate refreshed.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",63467
"102148","This blend of the two classic grapes of Vinho Verde, Loureiro and Alvarinho, is packed with fruit. Apples, lemons and a touch of ripe pear just fill the palate. It is a dry wine, refreshing and crisp with a mineral aftertaste.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",102148
"3268","Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet. It's a chunky, heavy wine with thick, jammy plum flavors that have strong herbal undertones. Warm, grabby and baked on the finish, which is plodding.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",3268
"67922","A wonderful wine that has preserved its freshness while welcoming elements of toasty maturity. It is crisp, definitely on the dry side, with red currants, bright wild strawberries over the purest acidity. It's sure to age over many years, but, if you must, can be drunk now.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",67922
"1306","Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, dark spice and game come together in the glass. On the palate, notes of ground pepper and anise accent a core of dried black cherry while dusty tannins give it a firm finish. Drink soon.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",1306
"88282","Heavily oaked and charred aromas of saucy berry fruits and espresso lead to a choppy, astringent palate. Reedy plum and berry flavors are a touch herbal and saucy. It feels tannic and drawing on an oaky finish that sports a clove note. Drink from 2018–2026.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",88282
"39281","Part of a wine series made from indigenous varieties of northeast Italy, this easy-going effort shows medium structure, with a creamy fullness. The finish has bright endnotes of cut grass, lime and honeydew. It's perfect for appetizers or light summer lunches.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",39281
"1928","Jammy black-fruit aromas are woody, reduced and come across cheesy. A thick, tannic, oaky body is home to flavors of plastic, creamy oak, vanilla and charred berries. This is pasty, oaky and creamy on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Chile",1928
"3391","This wine has been in bottle a while, perhaps to round out its flavors components, which tend toward candied cherry and spice. Aged in American oak, the tannins remain tight-grained and the aromas focused, but the wine falls somewhat flat on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",3391
"72060","Wood aromas are out front, with notes of vanilla, dill and char, making it hard to get at the fruit. On the palate, the oak almost completely obliterates any sense of the fruit underneath as well. The variety is completely lost.","Red","Grenache","US",72060
"99900","Aromas seem advanced, with notes of cherry liqueur, leather, barrel spices and raisinated dark fruit. The dried-fruit flavors are full with chalky tannins. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",99900

"41842","If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately.","White","Pinot Grigio","Argentina",41842
"28520","The Sullivan designate mixes Pommard, Wädenswil and Dijon 777 clones, which were aged 10 months in 30% new French oak. It's similar to the winery's Dardis bottling in terms of the balance between fruit and herbs, though here there is a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Otherwise, it's a friendly mix of black cherry, cola and chocolate: forward and open.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28520
"33835","A complement to the winery's Estate-labeled Tempranillo, it's made in a more fruit forward, less tannic style—though there are still firm, grainy tannins aplenty. It has notes of pencil shavings, red fruit and sweet spices accented by mouthwatering acidity. Try it with food—preferably Spanish tapas—to see it at its best.","Red","Tempranillo","US",33835
"45352","Toast, espresso, oak and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the palate offers dried black cherry, raw cranberry, orange zest and oak. Raspy tannins leave a bracing, drying finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",45352

The lightweight palate offers clean flavors of peach and melon, with zippy acidity and a brisk finish. It's super tasty and easy to like, so enjoy now.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",73925
"73399","The initially effusive nose of strawberries and caramel quiets rather quickly, replaced by cola and tree bark. There's more of the same in the mouth, finishing with a stemmy note. —J.C.","Red","Pinot Noir","Australia",73399
"102768","The nose is closed and gives away little. Fresh, clean and lemony, the palate is colored slightly by fresh pear but there is not much besides. Drink as fresh as possible.","White","Pinot Blanc","France",102768
"65554","A light, pale raspberry flavor seems to run a mile wide and an inch deep. Seeming slightly sugary, this just doesn't have any weight.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",65554
"97823","A blend of 73% Petite Sirah with 17% Zinfandel, this is a black, inky wine, as to be expected, from Spring Mountain's longstanding York Creek Vineyard. Dusty, earthy and mouthfilling, it is out and out savory. Tastes of black pepper and gamy oak lead to a lingering finish marked by more peppery spice.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",97823
"29088","Smooth and rich, this shows notes of apricot, intense pepper and spice, with a dry, firm structure. There is a tangy orange zest character that gives some tightness, suggesting it can age.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",29088
"38937","Green bell pepper and gooseberry notes dominate this Sauvignon Blanc, although it does have notes of honey and Meyer lemons. It's bright in acidity, and the finish is spicy and clean. For the price, it's a good value.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",38937
"48260","Easy berry and plum aromas come across clean and pure. This has a staunch mouthfeel with rubbery, pinching tannins. Earthy, ripe berry and plum flavors turn even riper on the back palate and finish, which lingers in a solid state.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",48260

"63736","Refined and aromatic, this rewards your full attention. Polished cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors come with a light dash of herbs and penetrating acids. The delicate side of Pinot Noir is on display here, but in a most ageworthy package. Drink now through 2026.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63736
"90614","This is a light, fruity wine that's ripe with perfumed quince and tropical fruit flavors. The palate is satisfyingly balanced with tight, bright acidity. This is wine that is not for aging, and ready to drink now.","White","Pinot Gris","France",90614

"48684","Bright red-fruit tones of hibiscus and pomegranate meet with dried fennel on the complex nose of this bottling from the winery owned by pioneering vintner Louis Lucas and his friend, Judge Royce Lewellen. It's light bodied, but with a grippy texture, showing candied rose petal, thyme and roasted red-fruit flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",48684
"6164","Rich, satisfying and full bodied, this wine is packed with delicious fruit and spice flavors while structured by good acidity and fine tannins that keep the texture lively. Layers of cherry, currant, cedar and cinnamon fill the flavor profile, and a long finish completes the package.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",6164
"9273","Fully mature, this calls to mind an inexpensive village Burgundy: one that is just a touch past its prime. Delicate secondary fruit flavors and firm acidity are in place, with residual hints of tomato leaf and flesh.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9273
"35116","Tastes highly confected, with strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors that come across almost like bubble gum or cotton candy. Dissappointing.","Red","Shiraz","Australia",35116
"92432","Vermentino makes a great companion to sushi, Mediterranean fish dishes, light pasta salad or chicken salad. There's a zesty touch of fresh sage or rosemary on the nose followed by peach, citrus and melon aromas.","White","Vermentino","Italy",92432
"73200","Classic Dry Creek Zin. There's a reason this warmish Sonoma region is so famous for Zinfandel, and here it is. The wine is strong and spicy and tannic, with profuse wild berry, pine cone, red currant, cherry liqueur and cola flavors, made piquant with Indian spices. Despite its exuberance, it's dry and balanced. Just lovely if you're in the mood for Zinfandel.","Red","Zinfandel","US",73200
"46369","This powerful blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc by longtime urban winemaker Benjamin Silver comes together in a big way. Aromas recall rosemary-crusted beef, boysenberry, sweet tar and, thanks to the oak-aging, both caramel and vanilla. The rich palate shows black cherry, black raspberry and a pinch of tarragon.","Red","Red Blend","US",46369
"16007","Grapy aromas suggest minerals and iodine along with wet animal fur and plum. It's firm and tannic on the palate, with herbal, rooty plum and berry flavors and a tight finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",16007
"58117","Berry and plum aromas are clean and composed. The wine feels juicy, pure and medium to full in body. Flavors of cherry and plum are spiced up with a white pepper note, while oaky spice and dusty pepper flavors create a lasting, long finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",58117
"39392","From a parcel of vines in the Meursault village appellation, this attractive, soft wine has ripe grapefruit and pear flavors to go with the crisp acidity and the lightest touch of wood. Drink from 2015.","White","Chardonnay","France",39392
"46389","Fresh, even vigorous pear and lemon zest notes make a promising opening. The palate is light but has a concentrated, almost fizzing core of peppery, citrussy freshness and delivers lots of verve. This is a collaborative effort between a German star chef and an Austrian winemaker to celebrate this variety's endless versatility with imaginative cooking. I think they've done themselves justice.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",46389
"68376","Dark and rich in color, this dense, gamy and smoky wine offers licorice and leather in equal proportions. It's still young and grippy on the palate, but time should soften its layers, which do mellow on the finish. Cellar through 2017,","Red","Syrah","US",68376
"20730","This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon with 40% Merlot is youthfully exuberant and full of life. Plum aromas lead into pencil and clove, the fruit at first subdued in order to make way for the complexity of savory seasonings. Ready to enjoy, it packs a refined punch of leather on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",20730
"14393","This is a textured wine from a six-acre vineyard. It has fine tannins as well as red-plum skin and red-berry fruits. It is balanced and fruity although the texture does give it a tangy edge that should soften out from 2017.","Red","Gamay","France",14393
"57815","Both the fruit and the aromatic foliage of wild raspberries rise first from the glass. They are followed by richer, delicious strawberry and cream notes, with hints of almond patisserie and strawberry shortcake. The palate is resonant with yeasty, rounded autolytic notes that frame the wonderfully wilful English hedgerow character. The mousse is lively but soft and the finish long and echoing.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","England",57815
"58240","Produced from organically grown grapes and bottled without added sulfur, this wine is full of life. With its juicy fruit and jammy texture, bursts with blackberry and black plum flavors. It's likely to age quickly, so drink from 2018.","Red","Malbec","France",58240
"31224","This focused white opens with alluring aromas of citrus, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of baking spice. Made with Malvasia Istriana, Friulano and Riesling Renano, the savory palate offers juicy peach, nectarine, apricot and ripe pear. It has a tangy lemon-drop finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",31224
"12692","Full bodied and balanced, this conveys aromas of menthol, underbrush, savory herb, fennel, tilled soil and leather.

"20040","The fruit that was used to make this Pinot Grigio was sourced from a High Valley vineyard situated at an elevation of 2,000 feet. The resulting wine is full of citrus and green apple aromas and flavors. The finish shows a touch of sweetness.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",20040
"34150","The color on this is surprisingly evolved, showing more brick than garnet, while the nose offers underbrush, tobacco, fennel and red berry. The palate is closed and rather lean, offering raw red cherry, licorice, menthol and mineral alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",34150
"81461","A bit muted and easy-drinking with soft notes of tart green apple and lemon peel throughout. It's brisk and prickly on the tongue with a fleeting finish; drink up.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","South Africa",81461
"22939","This is the top cuvée from Pouilly-Fuissé's most famous estate. It is a big, round wine, its curves opulent and generous. There are yellow fruits, particularly apricots, and the wine is given some sinew by its acidity and by the light spice aftertaste.","White","Chardonnay","France",22939
"57803","The top red from Adega Mayor, this is serious and impressive. Its firm, dry and dusty tannins are balanced by an intense blackberry flavor and contrasted with licorice and coffee notes. As it ages, it will become more intense and elegant.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",57803
"3877","Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",3877
"79114","Light in color, this shows red cherry and strawberry flavors. The tannins are soft, creating an easy wine that is ready to drink.","Red","Gamay","France",79114
"101492","Dusty leather, cedar and pencil shaving notes integrate seamlessly with the moderate oak and firm tannins of this wine from a vineyard originally planted by Robert Pepi. Its medium-bodied power makes it friendly for the table or as a before-dinner glass, the finish marked by a pronounced bittersweet chocolate flavor.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101492
"87156","At this scale (170,000 cases imported), the quality is remarkable. Leafy notes accent pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, coming together in a harmonious, easy-drinking finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",87156
"56654","Fuzzy apricot skin and peach form the backbone of this white that's stainless-steel and neutral-oak fermented, giving just a suggestion of barrel age. Tingly in acidity it's a balanced wine with oomph.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",56654
"1527","An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1527
"94380","Quite dark in the glass, this very concentrated blend of 37% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 28% Mourvèdre shows boisterous aromas of black currant, blueberry, vanilla, violet and clove on the nose. Rich as expected in body, the bottling offers nutmeg and black-cherry-syrup flavors on the sip, with a touch of prune as well. It's a heavy-duty attention grabber.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",94380
"19773","Tastes like a rustic Zinfandel, with spicy, briary flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and dark chocolate. The tannins are somewhat green and angular.","Red","Primitivo","US",19773
"18538","Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",18538
"66299","This ripe, charred, dark-as-night Malbec captures the lush essence of Argentina at its finest. Deep aromas of licorice, blackberry, coffee and toast set up a full, layered palate, with vanilla, baking spice, black plum and blackberry flavors. A lusty finish with licorice, mocha and tobacco notes is generous and dandy. Drink through 2023.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",66299
"28762","New oak figures prominently on the palate of this generous and ripe wine, an impression that's nicely offset by ample structure and juicy acidity. It's balanced and approachable, so enjoy now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28762
"101491","This full-bodied and complex wine has loads of personality. An exotic, slightly earthy aroma leads to fruity richness and good viscosity on the palate, with a creamy texture and wonderful sense of layering.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101491
"81746","With forward pineapple jam, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla and smoky oak flavors, this will satisfy Chard lovers. It's dry, with a creamy mouthfeel.","White","Chardonnay","US",81746
"90710","Exceptionally ripe and juicy, with briary wild-blackberry and cherry flavors. It's a good wine, a little coarse, but nicely dry and spicy. A brief decant will help soften the tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90710

"66261","This wine opens with very flinty aromas of struck graphite and pencil shavings, with touches of fermenting orange and cranberry. It's light in weight but darkly flavored on the palate, with slate and clove spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",66261
"38713","Done in a forward tutti–frutti style, this puts all the flavor right up front. Grape candy is what comes to mind, with a light tannic finish. It's a good gulping wine for decks, campers and picnic outings.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",38713
"11346","Despite some grit and tar on the nose, this Rioja opens well with spicy cherry and plum aromas. A standard, mild palate is satisfactory, while lightly roasted slightly briny plum and berry flavors end with a hint of saltiness.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",11346
"60345","Certainly a bigger, denser wine than the Carneros Pinot. The plummy-berry flavors are wrapped in sturdy, rich tannins, with extra notes of earth and herbs. Feels weighty on the palate, a wine of importance, not to mention elegance. The density suggests meats on the bone.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",60345
"13774","The smell of canned mushy peas pours out of the glass and just won't release its iron-handed grip. That same intense vegetal character is present at all other points as well, from the thick palate to the murky finish. It doesn't have much going for it, but at least it's consistent.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",13774
"66520","Lemony freshness marks a certain tartness on a light, lissom, fresh palate. With more time on palate there are hints of savoriness and some textured spice. Drink soon.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",66520
"40315","Coniale is one of those beautifully balanced Italian Cabs that is plush and dense, but elegant and fine at the same time. The wine boast ripened blackberry and cassis and there is not a green note in sight. Indeed, soft spice and firm tannins promise a bright aging future.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Italy",40315
"67781","Here's a lush and modern Rosso di Montalcino with bright aromas of spice and vanilla that play background roles to fresh cherry and raspberry. The wine boasts a smooth, supple texture and sweet fruit on the finish.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",67781
"95853","Jammy, scratchy, oddly spiced aromas set up a drawing, cloying palate feel. Gummy strawberry and raspberry flavors finish short and briny, with a sweet, chocolaty note.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",95853
"101143","The grapes were farmed biodynamically, fermented with wild yeasts, and just two barrels were aged in new oak. The stiff berry fruit is cloaked in details of stem and earth, tart acids and a whiff of compost.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",101143
"48427","This is bold and assertive, yet mellow. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the house style of soft approachability and complexity, offering tiers of blackberry, currant, sage, dried herb and smoky oak. Drink now–2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",48427
"96712","This wine's ripe berry, vanilla, toast, raisin and cedar aromas set the stage for an intense palate with choppy tannins. Its blackberry, caramel and vanilla flavors are rich and ripe, tasting pure on the finish, with a strong punch of chocolaty oak. Drink through 2024.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",96712
"37396","This Chard is smooth in the mouth, with white stone fruit on the palate, plus white pepper and mineral notes that extend through the finish. What's here is pleasant enough, but more of these good things wouldn't hurt.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",37396
"13097","Light-bodied and yet offering a depth of complexity, this is resplendent in rhubarb and spicy anise, layered and textured in silky waves of fleshy flavor. A well balanced and approachable selection that's enjoyable now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",13097
"9243","A softly textured wine, this has richness coming from black and red berry fruits. Wood and juiciness combine well in this attractive wine that will be ready to drink in a few months.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",9243
"104547","The Middle Reach is an informal name for the warmer, northern part of the valley that should have its own appellation. In this wine, you'll find elaborate apricot, tangerine, Meyer lemon and peach flavors, alongside brisk acidity and oak influences. It's a gorgeous wine for drinking soon.","White","Chardonnay","US",104547
"21608","Opens like a full-bore barrel buster with heavy char and leather. With time it settles on coffee, toast, chocolate and fig aromas. The palate is big and chewy, with peppery, toasty blackberry fruit and then more toast and coffee on the finish. Seems as much about the barrel as the fruit.","Red","Malbec","Chile",21608
"62799","Although this is the winery's reserve-level blend, it doesn't work well in this vintage. Vague and muted, the mix of grapes lacks focus, offering just a thin, generic red wine with a chalky aftertaste.","Red","Red Blend","US",62799
"33112","Forest, Yatir's top-of-the-line offering, is always a dense and powerful wine that can age. Right now, the wine smells young and a bit closed, hiding some of its beauty and nuance behind the upfront black plum, cassis and cherry fruit aromas. Hints of fruitcake spice, bramble, cigar box and leather occasionally flicker in the background, revealing what time has in store for this dark beauty of a wine. Big and rich right now, with a full structure and gripping tannins. Drink 2016–2022.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Israel",33112
"46742","Aromas and flavors of green apple and white peach come together on this lively, elegant white. Racy acidity lifts up the creamy flavors while a mineral vein ties it all together.","White","Pinot Bianco","Italy",46742
"57366","Syrupy red cherry, hibiscus and fruit-punch aromas show on the nose of this good-deal wine, along with touches of graphite and crushed potpourri. It's broad and a touch ripe on the palate, with pomegranate and marjoram notes.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57366
"4263","Typical light and fresh Grüner, with an attractive burst of lemon acidity as well as a creamy texture. Delicious, crisp wine. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",4263
"91754","This blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah offers balance and harmony, with no aromatic element out of place. It presents a steady wall of black fruit, soft cherry, tobacco, rum cake and dark leather. The soft, velvety tannins make this a great pasta or lasagna wine.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",91754
"97180","A nice, flavorful and dry Syrah for drinking now with barbecue or a rich lamb or beef stew. Soft and gentle, it's rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, beef jerky, pepper and smoky oak.","Red","Syrah","US",97180
"33098","Although the 2010 vintage was cooler than the previous two years, this Chardonnay still offers rich and luscious notes of crème caramel and baked pear. The intoxicating bouquet picks up layers of lemon zest and mineral.","White","Chardonnay","US",33098
"66830","This wine aims to call attention to the tendency of Clone 17 (also known as the Robert Young clone) to provide baked apple and ripe, almond flavors and aromas, which this bottling does, in spades. Caramel, oak and vanilla round out the rest of the experience, which is balanced, but big in ripeness and wood.","White","Chardonnay","US",66830
"36437","While this Chardonnay is rich, it is also well balanced. It offers light spice, rounded yellow fruits and just a touch of minerality to give texture, plus toastiness to add interest. The end brings out the acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",36437
"26805","Spicy cherry and plum aromas are dark yet austere. Racy, acidic and full of energy across the palate, this coastal Pinot delivers snappy beams of red plum and raspberry flavors before a lightly spiced finish that goes the distance.","Red","Pinot Noir","Chile",26805
"37191","For the first release of this wine, the oak unfortunately is almost completely overwhelming. Vanilla, green wood, mocha and mint overpower almost any sense of varietal aroma and flavor.","Red","Touriga Nacional","US",37191
"103609","A solid wine with firm tannins, this has structure as well as black-currant acidity. It still has a dry core although this will certainly soften over the next few months. It has the potential to be a ripe fruity wine from early 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",103609
"7599","This wine nicely displays the fleshy pear, melon and citrus notes of unoaked Chard. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. What it isn't is particularly complex, but it will still go well with any number of seafood or chicken dishes this summer.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",7599
"82715","This wine is a unique blend of Syrah (55%), Petit Verdot (a whopping 27%) and Malbec. Aromas of firepit, woodspice, dried herbs, lemon and barnyard are followed by surprisingly elegant fruit flavors, with Petit Verdot's often burly tannins nowhere to be found.","Red","Red Blend","US",82715
"55102","A light and fruity wine with attractive red fruits and acidity. There is just a touch of tannin to hold the friendly fruitiness together.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",55102
"56676","The winery's first 'Sweet Riesling' is somewhat aromatically reticent for the variety with notes of lychee, jasmine and apricot. The palate lives up to the label though with sweet (70g/L residual sugar) apricot and fresh mango flavors that linger on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",56676
"26800","A light hint of toastiness gives this wine complexity. Balanced and beautifully ripe, offering notes of apricots and fresh acidity, it's a pour that can be drunk now and will be better from 2016.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",26800
"83595","Brooding aromas of dates, herbs and cherry lead to full-bodied coffee and pit-fruit flavors that show a sense of balance and finesse.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",83595
"18441","While aromatically demure and light in body for a Gewürztraminer, this lip-smacking wine offers loads of fresh pineapple, grapefruit and tangerine flavor. It's medium-sweet in style yet refreshingly brisk through a moderately long finish. Drink now through 2018.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",18441
"28603","This was the first winery to make a truly white Pinot Noir (back in 2004). Produced exclusively from Pommard clones, it's barrel fermented and aged much like a Chardonnay. Along with great texture and length, there's plenty of acid supporting its palate-pleasing mix of white peach, melon and gooseberry. It finishes with a thread of lightly buttery caramel.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28603
"62467","Simple and fresh up front, this Verdejo deals common apple and nectarine aromas in front of a plump yet juicy palate. Flavors of citrus fruits, peach, saline and herbs finish pithy.","White","Verdejo","Spain",62467
"35611","The dark raspberry, plum, herb, vanilla and spice aromas and flavors are rich and high octane. It's not for the faint of heart but offers plenty of appeal.","Red","Grenache","US",35611
"39268","Tight and spicy, this offers a mix of red fruits, strong streaks of clove and licorice. There's an underlying taste of stem, and the acids leave a chalky aftertaste.","Red","Syrah","US",39268
"13400","Clean and fresh, with mineral undertones to the white grapefruit and fig flavors. Grassy upfront, providing that expected herbal edge. Drink now.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",13400
"17792","Aromas of blueberry and boysenberry are active and come with a whiff of animal fur. This feels chunky but not to the point of collapsing on itself. Flavors of plum, blackberry and juniper finish with clove notes and mild bitterness.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",17792
"32083","This appellation blend hits all the right Pinot points, with candied red cherry, strawberry and cinnamon spice. The palate blends cooked cranberry and sour cherry with anise and a touch of garrigue. A reliable sipper, especially for the price.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",32083
"13629","It's difficult to find the aromas of apple, pear and jasmine. This drinks off dry with nicely balanced acids.","White","Riesling","US",13629
"51824","Leesy aromas of vanilla and white flowers feature notes of peach and melon. This is round on the palate, with pear, honeydew and apple flavors. A rebound of leesy vanilla reappears on a mellow finish. Drink immediately or wait for the 2014.","White","Verdejo","Spain",51824
"83037","Alluring scents of wisteria, citrus and white peach lead the nose on this elegant sparkler. The lively palate doles out Bartlett pear and green apple alongside a creamy mousse and vibrant acidity, while a white almond note closes the finish.","White","Glera","Italy",83037
"23583","Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with black plum and clove aromas that carry over to the palate together with notes of toast and smoke. Gripping tannins leave a mouth-drying finish.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",23583
"80915","Crisp lemon aromas follow through to an equally crisp wine. It has a touch of pepper as well as citrus and green-plum fruits. The acidity and the tangy texture are given weight by the lees aging. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",80915
"75507","A bit on the hot side, reflecting the extra warmth that the Pope Valley region of eastern Napa Valley gets during the summer. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's massively flavored, huge in jammy blackberries, cherries, cassis and dark chocolate. The tannins are considerable, the finish long and ripe. Best to open this wine by 2015 or so.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",75507
"86232","Stiff tannins are matched to sharp raspberry and boysenberry fruit, crafting a well-defined, young and potent wine. This may benefit from another year or two in bottle, but it's already a tasty, albeit tight wine with a mix of fresh fruit and astringent, herb and cracker flavors.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",86232
"72801","Spicy, herbal plum and berry aromas are a bit rubbery and offer a sweet hint of cinnamon powder. This is deep and ripe on the palate, with rooty flavors of blackberry, fig and baking spices. Lasting rooty nuances blend with cocoa notes and mild heat on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",72801
"69200","A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is indeed a sturdy red table wine. The tannins are dense and chewy, the fruit submerged beneath barrel flavors of toast, caramel and nougat. It spent 20 months in 50% new French oak.","Red","Red Blend","US",69200
"46737","Wiry raspberry and plum aromas put this in the red-fruit category. A loud, tannic, expansive palate blazes with acidity, while fully toasted oak gives this a burnt element to match raspberry and red-plum flavors. Hard tannins and bold acidity make for a long, rugged finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",46737
"50911","Now in a smart clear blue bottle, this is Aveleda's estate wine. It is always a classic, with just some extra weight to give it distinction. The flavors are apple, brightened with lime, finishing with vibrant acidity.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",50911
"10947","These vines date back to the mid-1970s and were originally planted by Dick Erath. This is their final vintage, as they've been removed. As a last hurrah it's a fine one, an intriguing melding of floral, mint and citrus components. With 13g/L residual sugar, it's just slightly off dry, with good palate penetration and superior length.","White","Riesling","US",10947
"103824","Bracing acidity offsets plush and penetrating peach and marmalade flavors in this delightfully honeyed auslese. It's bold in flavor yet so sprightly in demeanor, finishing long on lingering tones of saffron and spice. It's delicious now but structured enough to continue to improve through at least 2026.","White","Riesling","Germany",103824
"103338","Aaron Jackson blends extreme coastal vineyards from Cayucos, Cambria, Pismo Beach and San Simeon into this wondrous wine, which shows blackberries, black cherries, damp fennel and wisps of blood on the nose. Mashed plums and Bing cherries emerge on the palate, along with black olives, elderflowers and a coyote brush grip.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",103338
"63801","The nose on this wine from American Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick is a bit reluctant to show itself at first, then lets go of rounded red and purple fruits, with freshly turned soil and dust. Ripe black cherries and tart plum skins mix on the earthy palate, and the tannins will unfurl with more time.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",63801
"85520","Just three barrels were made of this rather unusual wine. It's a seemingly disparate mix of raspberries, gun metal, dried seaweed and carpaccio, yet somehow it all comes together. The length is impressive. This is one of those wines that will thrill some tasters and puzzle others.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",85520
"41909","Initially this smells like iodine and inner tube, but with time it freshens up. Plump, dense and chewy on the palate, this Cabernet tastes a touch stewed, with prune, blackberry and peppery flavors. A dense finish is chunky and chewy but awkward.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",41909
"14981","This wine combines ripe raspberry and cherry flavors with sweet, smoky oak tones. A wine to drink now, it shows classic Russian River acidity, and it bears a minerally, salty profile that lends structural elegance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14981
"63042","Very big, modern, sweet and oaky. And that doesn't mean it's bad, because the richness, high alcohol (15%), buttery barrel notes and candy-like qualities are all rendered well. Still, be on the watch for creamy oak, cinnamon, café mocha and butter more than precise, angular fruit character. Should get more integrated with another year of bottle age. The boisterous blend is Garnacha, Syrah and Mazuelo.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",63042
"6080","Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant.","Red","Tempranillo","US",6080
"4857","An awkward, unbalanced wine. Has green, vegetal flavors alongside sweet candied raspberries.","Red","Zinfandel","US",4857
"40132","There is dialed-high acidity on the front palate of this wine, followed by lean layers of pineapple and fig. Aged in 40% new French oak, the toast notes are subtle and the finish satisfyingly soft.","White","Chardonnay","US",40132
"12910","The 2009 vintage has produced a more subdued expression from Barbaresco's celebrated Basarin cru. This has a tight, tannic grip, with tame aromas of wild berry, cola and ginger.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",12910
"60932","Chocolate and raspberry join forces in this jammy, soft and round wine that's sizable yet approachable. This is a good go-to for midweek meals and parties, with a medium body and respectable finish that will pair with a wide range of foods.","Red","Merlot","US",60932
"26974","An alluring nose of mocha, dark fruit and tobacco spice starts this stylish Shiraz. Rich, integrated flavors of mint, cherry and a touch of smoke are appealing and serious. A lingering finish adds to the classy character. Pair with a savory stew.","Red","Shiraz","South Africa",26974
"92993","Fresh and enticing aromas of blackberry, raspberry, cedar and green olive are abundant in this Bordeaux-style blend. The palate is bursting with jammy berries, molasses, cedar and vanilla. The tannins are supple but smooth and are a matched well for the rich body. The finish is long and full of depth.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",92993
"56438","Pear and apple aromas lead the way on this fresh, spritely wine that tingles the palate with a lightly spritzy feel. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but would work perfectly with baked fish.","White","Chardonnay","US",56438
"90046","Aromas of plum, cranberry, wood spice and herb are followed by concentrated red and black-fruit flavors. A silky mouthfeel and firm tannins only add to the enjoyment.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90046
"49217","Dusty spice and resiny oak aromas sit on top of pedestrian apple, pear and melon notes. This Chardonnay from a complicated, rainy vintage feels round and chunky, and sort of oily. Oaky peach flavors finish with little but barrel spice.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",49217
"96771","Tastes more like a Zinfandel, with peppery flavors of wild blackberries and briary mulberries, edged with tobacco and balsam. Tannic, too, with a rough mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",96771
"66511","This copper-colored wine has good, light cherry and apple aromas, and fresh, tangy but lean fruit flavors. It is nicely dry, well balanced and a bit crisp in texture.","Rosé","Rosé","US",66511
"8322","Cabernet specialist Venge tinkers with white blends under the Spettro designation, with inconsistent results. This 2010 is mainly Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, with a splash of Chenin Blanc. It's a good, sound white wine, dry and crisp in acidity, with mineral-infused pear, citrus fruit and apricot flavors. No oak is evident.","White","White Blend","US",8322
"53303","From one of those rare properties in Pauillac that are not classified growths, this wine is ripe, dark, still smoky and very structured. It has some of the weight of the vintage although in a restrained way, giving juicy black currant fruits behind the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",53303
"31004","A fine blend of ripe cherry, berry, spice and herb flavors, all framed in toasty oak and spice nuance. Smooth but bright on the palate, with a zippy finish and subtle earth tones at the end.","Red","Merlot","US",31004
"105190","This is an attractive wine with its ripe red fruits contrasted with the tangy orange zest and acidity. It's definitely a food rosé, very dry and with bright acidity shining through at the end.","Rosé","Rosé","France",105190
"67567","This winery's basic Pinot has had a mixed record over the years. The '08 is dry and silky, but not particularly interesting at this price. It has gentle cherry, raspberry, cola, spice and oak flavors, offset by crisp acids. Drink now.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67567
"50573","This wine starts out a bit reduced, along with aromas of melon and red apple. It drinks a hair off dry, with a blend of stone-fruit and tropical flavors.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",50573
"84511","Woody smelling up front, this is a thick, ripe Malbec with sweet plum and berry aromas and flavors. Despite feeling fat, this has adequate acidity to match resiny oak and jammy berry fruit. Wood spice is the dominant flavor on the finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",84511
"93124","Vanilla and butter touches give this medium-bodied, rather oaky wine extra richness. Its soft, creamy texture and muted fruit flavors are a bit unusual for the type, but it's still quite enjoyable to sip.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",93124
"13042","Jammy berry aromas include a seemingly misplaced note of cinnamon. This feels full, blocky and tannic, with old-fashioned clamp. Flavors of oak, plum and cherry form a familiar whole, while this tastes earthy and dry on the finish, with modest heat. Drink through 2021.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",13042
"45398","An almost neutral nose nonetheless gives slight hints of crisp citrus. An ultralight body provides easy, clean-cut drinking with a superdry, citrussy finish. Drink soon.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",45398
"10834","Grass, citrus fruits, feline and canned green-vegetable aromas lead into a plump, round palate. Green bean, passion fruit, lemon-lime and bell pepper flavors end with strong influences of arugula and asparagus. This is coastal-driven and green, but good.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",10834
"42612","Another in the new N&N; line, the Sullenger features red and black fruit, herbs, some earth, and an appealing whiff of sautéed pancetta or bacon. Commendable richness in support of black-plum flavor and coffee notes. Its poundcake-like density urges cellaring.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42612
"61343","Tart, sugar-frosted fruit comes to mind—candied red-currant and passion-fruit preserve. This is a wine on a tight-rope walk between tropical richness and lively tartness—it is thus just made for desserts that put equally tart fruits center stage. Alluring and different, with a lifted edge of pine resin, this is certainly a wine for felicitous experimenting.","Red","Blaufränkisch","Austria",61343
"39815","This is one of those wines that tastes dramatic and important. It's marked by rich, thick tannins, but they're ripe and smooth, and frame complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, grilled teriaki beef and black pepper, enriched with smoky cedar. Texturally, it's medium-bodied and velvety, like a Merlot.","Red","Syrah","US",39815
"44882","Floral and citric, with clean, juicy aromas that conjure memories of orange blossoms and fresh lime. The palate is light and mildly citric, with melon and papaya flavors bringing a tropical edge. Ready to drink now.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",44882
"13548","This wine comes from a vineyard, created in 1894, in which the vines are planted against walls to get the maximum reflected heat. It is a majestic wine—a smooth wave, opulent and rich with intense acidity and just a hint of spice. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will be even more impressive from 2018.","White","Chenin Blanc","France",13548
"83825","Dusty stone-fruit and white-flower aromas are mature, while the palate is linear and citric. Dry salty flavors of pineapple and tangerine finish with notes of mustard, lemon and brine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Argentina",83825
"7571","Dark on the nose, with peppery spice, mocha, basil and secondary berry aromas. Shows power and density in the mouth, with burnt, blackened flavors of blackberry, plum and pepper. Even more peppery on the finish. More black and dark than typically herbal and spicy.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",7571
"102583","Baking spice, dried flower, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of coconut lead the nose on this straightforward Barolo. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast and vanilla alongside firm, tightly knit tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",102583
"99741","Aromas of dark-skinned berry, French oak, wild rose and a whiff of Alpine herb lift out of the glass. Linear and tense, the taut palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, clove and a hint of espresso alongside a backbone of firm fine-grained tannins and bracing acidity. Drink 2017–2020.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",99741
"43224","Duras and Syrah grapes take credit for this ripe, spicy wine. With its red fruit and plenty of pepper and caramel flavors, it's a full-bodied rosé—much better with food than by itself. Drink now.","Rosé","Rosé","France",43224
"46757","This is bright in notes of apple blossom, lemon and lime, with additional hints of mineral and oak. Developing in the glass, it offers flavors of grapefruit and lemongrass from middle to end, while the finish is lightly marked by a honey accent.","White","Chardonnay","US",46757
"72153","Spice, pepper, chocolate and a hint of stem are all wrapped into this light-hearted Cabernet Franc. The pretty, sweet, cherry candy core gives it immediate appeal. Drink up.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",72153
"37231","This wine starts out brooding, with aromas of vanilla, herbs and brown spices. The cherry flavors are full bodied yet show subtlety, with a captivating mouthfeel and meaty flavors on the finish that increase the interest.","Red","Syrah","US",37231
"98220","Depth and complexity are key parts of this ripe Malbec that opens with hints of mushroom and stewed berry fruits along with cedary oak and tobacco. Mature and dense on the palate, this mixes blackberry fruit with raisin and prune, then follows with tea, spice and chocolate flavors on the back palate and finish. Drink now.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",98220
"104807","This is a concentrated wine that is structured and packed with red fruits and solid tannins. It feels weighty and rich; the juicy character is balanced by a firm, dry texture. For aging over several years.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",104807
"31667","Here's a savory, focused red made with 80% Nebbiolo, 10% Croatina and 10% Vespolina that opens with aromas of dark berry, tilled soil and crushed aromatic herb. The delineated palate offers black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and sage alongside firm but polished tannins. It shows depth and breeding. Drink through 2025.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",31667
"5378","This Viognier from the outlands region of Elqui is minerally but low on fruit aromas. A fresh, linear palate offers lettuce, lime and other limited green-leaning flavors, while the finish is lasting and firm, with zesty acidity.","White","Viognier","Chile",5378
"82450","Fresh but faint aromas of hay, candlewax and grass open this honest but simple effort. The palate lacks intensity but displays a bit of a mineral streak. Disappointingly short on the finish. Imported by Nelwood Wines.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",82450
"43069","The aromas of this light-bodied wine are herbal and savory, while the flavors resemble melon and celery. It has a smooth style, with more of a ripe texture than a tart one.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",43069
"38517","Heavy oak is a front-row theme throughout this tannic, extracted, black-tinted Garnacha. Hot fudge sundae and sawmill aromas lead to a palate that's as tannic as sandpaper. Its charred, heavily oaked flavors finish chocolaty, with a lasting and overbearing taste of clove, lacking balance and clarity of fruit.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",38517
"72303","Quite light, with tart rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's more than a hint of peppery herb, and a tart, quick finish.","Red","Sangiovese","US",72303
"102221","Sharp in acids, with a knife-like cutting quality that slices right through and across the wine's natural cherry flavors. The tannins are bigtime, too. Doesn't seem at all likely to improve in the bottle.","Red","Barbera","US",102221
"95286","Earthy blackberry flavors include carob and herbal accents. This is drawing and high in acidity, while earthy, herbal flavors of raspberry and plum are a bit green. Charred oak, clove and leafy berry flavors take over on the finish.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",95286
"34542","Fruity and floral aromas of blackberry and violet lead the nose along with a trace of kitchen spice. The easygoing palate presents juicy black cherry, spiced blueberry and a white pepper note alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2017.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",34542
"89211","Good results almost always occur when J. Lohr, most of whose red wines come from Paso Robles, uses Cabernet Sauvignon from this Napa Valley vineyard. The 2009 is the best effort yet: It's very rich in black currant flavor, yet it is perfectly balanced, with fine acidity and smooth tannins. Drink this lovely wine now and over the next six years.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",89211
"72079","This perfumed wine, with a dry tannic core, is just beginning to soften. The potential for the black fruits is already there. Drink this solid wine from early 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",72079
"51228","Orange peel and zesty tangerine follow aromas of honey and butterscotch. Moscato della Torre is a smooth and generous wine with intense flavors and medium acidity. Drink it alone or with aged cheese.","White","Moscato","Italy",51228
"28101","This over-the-top wine has an unusually deep color and a potent, charred-wood aroma, followed by sweet-seeming oak and dried-fruit flavors. It's medium bodied and a touch tannic in texture.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",28101
"92131","Made from a field blend of old vines, this is a dense wine. Full of tannins and with a strongly mineral texture (you can almost taste the dirt), it is solid with rich fruit, acidity and hints of wood aging. This powerful wine needs to age another year, so drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",92131
"40066","Pretty harsh, with unripe, green tannins and tart pepper and blackberry flavors. The price is pretty good, at least.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",40066
"67605","This Red Mountain Syrah spent a year in French oak, half new, half once-used. The fruit is wrapped in smoke and coffee, graphite and mineral scents and flavors. Crystal clear and densely packed, this shows none of the funk common in many Washington Syrahs, but an almost claret-like structure and grip. It should age well for a decade or longer.","Red","Syrah","US",67605
"94373","Pungently earthy in cigar box and compost, this is a compact and densely powerful wine, full of blackberry-jam flavor dipped in chocolate and cinnamon spice.","Red","Zinfandel","US",94373
"78862","An estate-grown vineyard-designate, this impressive offering is smooth in cherry, berry and clove, with wisps of black pepper dancing around its edges. The finish is long and spicy. It's complex yet fun, and will do well at the table though it's also easy enough to enjoy on its own.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78862
"100598","This lighter-style Cab offers berry-fruit and black-tea flavors, and nut and oak finish. It's an easy quaffer, but nothing to mull over.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",100598
"94873","Aromas of resin, vanilla, toast and espresso carry over to the palate. It's dense and sweet with drying tannins on the finish. This isn't an ager so enjoy soon with hearty first courses or medium seasoned cheeses.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",94873
"7968","Aromas of mature black plum, espresso, wild rose and spice emerge on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, menthol, mint, white pepper, well-integrated oak and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",7968
"35808","Woody, wet herbs of oregano and thyme mix with bitter chocolate, a whiff of smoke and extract cranberry and blueberry on the nose of this winery's top-end bottling. Dark flavors of black cherries, blueberries and pencil lead show on the highly structured palate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",35808
"33396","This opens with intense aromas of violet, ripe dark-skinned berry and baking spice. The bright, succulent palate shows black cherry, crushed raspberry and black pepper alongside fresh acidity and smooth tannins. Enjoy through 2018.","Red","Barbera","Italy",33396
"66989","A blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of sunbaked earth, dried herb, dark berry and a whiff of underbrush. The soft straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry and a hint of spice framed in easygoing tannins. Drink soon.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",66989
"77679","Punchy yet secure aromas of apple, pear, grass and green herbs are expansive. A forward, layered, sensuous palate delivers yeasty, toasty apple and pear flavors. On the finish, softness, depth and richness share space alongside acidity and length. Drink through 2019.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Spain",77679
"103399","This is a lush and okay expression, with forward notes of wood-grilled apple, buttered toast, caramel corn and honeydew on the nose and mouth. The mouthfeel is round and creamy, with ample acidity to cut the wine's weight and dense, rich flavors. Flavors of honeycomb and sweet spice hang on to the close. Drink now–2019.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",103399
"16227","This tropical mélange of fruit and blossoms lives up to its equally ebullient packaging. While deft in body, it bounds from the glass with floral perfume and juicy watermelon and cherry flavors. It's zesty and bold yet spry and fresh—an aptly named accompaniment to summer.","Rosé","Rosé","US",16227
"90178","Quite dark in the glass, this bottling, which includes a bit of the other main Bordeaux varietals, shows concentrated blueberries, blackcurrant, cola and fudges notes on the nose. It's soft and rich on the palate, with fine-grained tannins revealing more dense, dark fruit, touches of mint and chocolate, and a nice floral component.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",90178
"101367","Earthy and rustic, this Pinot Noir is lightweight, with a hint of red cherry. There is an unpleasant bitter aftertaste.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",101367
"30757","Rich, ripe aromas of mango and guava lend a distinctly tropical feel to this off-dry Riesling. It's juicy and lush on the palate, with sweet grapefruit and tangerine flavors offset by a swathe of fresh, green herbs on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",30757
"80790","This has a toasty edge that complements the ripe red fruit and attractive lemon and yeast character. It seems to be well on its way to maturity, retaining a fruity style while its flavors are beginning to dig deeper.","Sparkling","Champagne Blend","France",80790
"50040","Elegant, aromatic, and expressive in the nose, this blossoms into a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, bark, spice and sassafras. Good acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the tannins and the finish. Though very light for Syrah, this has good balance and length.","Red","Syrah","US",50040
"73370","Aromas of celery, arugula, snap pea, dusty apple and citrus announce a clean palate with scouring acidity. Lemon-lime and grapefruit flavors are typical of Casablanca SB, while a fresh, citrusy finish brings a green-herb element into play.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",73370
"74033","Made from organically grown grapes, this wine opens in grass and grapefruit pith, crisply inviting one in. Lemon zest complements the refreshing juiciness while the finish has a bit of a bite, giving an edgy complexity.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",74033
"95229","Neutral on the nose except for some oily rusticity. The palate is full with okay acidity and sweet flavors suggestive of mango, pineapple and melon.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",95229
"33806","Fresh and light with ripe fruit notes of red apple and apricot spiced with hints of white florals and lime zest. The medium weight mouth is juicy and clean, the ripe stone fruit flavors carrying through to the close. Drink now.","White","Viognier","South Africa",33806
"14908","The wine's barrel aging comes through immediately, with its toasted nut and vanilla nose. On the palate, the wine is balanced—with its citrus fruit, spice and touch of flowers. Elegant and easy to love—a good use of oak.","White","Chardonnay","US",14908
"86854","Here's a young, hedonistic Pinot that captures the essence of RRV from a perfect vintage. Although it's ripely forward in cherry, pomegranate, Dr. Pepper, red licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, it shows a structural sophistication that elevates the score. Beautiful now, and should improve over the next 6 years.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86854
"51364","Curious hints of sweet spice and chocolate accent yellow plum and cherry flavors in this slightly off-dry Riesling. The palate boasts a penetrating array of fruit-salad flavors highlighted with a streak of lemon and lime. Finishes moderately long.","White","Riesling","Germany",51364
"60006","Sweet vanilla mingles with ripe cherries and plums on the nose and palate of this supple, soft Long Island Merlot. Bright acidity and a hint of green, leafy herbs add freshness on the palate. Finishes on a slightly grippy, tannic note.","Red","Merlot","US",60006
"23702","The 2009 Abtsberg Superior is inferior to its Herrenberg counterpart, but remains a very good wine. Hints of sweat and wet stones mark the nose, while the fruit is more expressive on the palate, coming across as greengage plum and bright citrus. Medium bodied; crisp on the finish.","White","Riesling","Germany",23702
"29450","This bold, fruity wine is all red berries and ripe cherry flavors. It has good juiciness, soft tannins and it will be ready to drink soon. A bright wine, with great acidity at the end.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",29450
"88275","The nose is shy but a deeper sniff reveals ripe notes of green pear. These also appear on the compact and slender palate, accented by a bright lemon freshness. It's refreshing, clean and bright, and the finish leaves you wanting more.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",88275
"103202","This lush, ripe Syrah has its precision points across the bouquet—namely graphite, mint and pure black-fruit scents. On the palate, this blends juicy liveliness with layered richness. Flavors of blackberry, dark plum, chocolate, mixed spices and fresh herbs add up to one yummy, well-oaked, balanced wine. Drink through 2018.","Red","Syrah","Chile",103202
"45411","This is completely dominated by oak. It doesn't have the fruity richness to support the toasted notes and invasive wood sensations. It finishes on an astringent note.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",45411
"72478","Dried red cherries, dark strawberry, mulberry, light baking spice and freshly cracked pepper show on the nose of this balanced bottling of 40% Mourvèdre, 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache and 10% Counoise. The sip starts with a dusty character, and then lovely flavors of light purple fruit, lavender powder and intriguing florality ensue. It drinks great now, but will age marvelously. Enjoy from 2018–2033.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",72478
"9534","The aromas smell disjointed, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla and maple syrup. The palate is quite sweet and ripe, with abundant baking-spice accents.","Red","Primitivo","US",9534
"38118","Sharp and sassy for the most part, but with airing things improve a bit and you start to find red fruit and honest spice. The feel is lean and vibrant, with jumpy acids creating a crisp mouthfeel. Will settle somewhat but won't ever deliver much in the way of rich berry fruit or a chewy mouthfeel.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",38118
"48364","Full in flavor and body, this sturdy wine based on Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris with a dash of Chardonnay has crisp acidity to keep it lively. It smells like pears and honeydew melon and tastes dry but generous and a little buttery, and finishes clean.","White","White Blend","US",48364
"93463","Newsome-Harlow's Shake Ridge is true to its famous Foothills vineyard source year after year and 2009 is no exception. The wine is a little muted at first, gamey even, with looming, site-specific, tarry structure. Give it a rest and it should open up in beautiful ways, its big, blueberry bones impeccably tamed.","Red","Zinfandel","US",93463
"40411","This is mustardy smelling, with salad-like aromas. It feels round, plump and a little heavy, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. Chunky in feel and briny in taste on the finish. Not as good as past vintages.","White","Verdejo","Spain",40411
"47799","Smoky leaf tobacco aromas are typical of young Cabernet Franc. And this wine, aged only in tank, is certainly much too young. It's full of brittle tannins and acidity that needs to soften. Wait until late 2015 before drinking.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",47799
"79351","Peach, honeyed limes and apple sauce aromas lead the nose of this blend made with 62% Viognier, 26% Grenache Blanc and 12% Rousanne. Caliza's Carl Bowker demonstrates great restraint in these often bombastic white Rhônes, so the apple-led palate is subdued, showing bits of spice or a touch of mustard on the end.","White","Rhône-style White Blend","US",79351
"102215","Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",102215
"29564","Hailing mostly from renowned Les Collines (44%) and Lewis (41%) vineyards and rounded out by up-and-comer Stoney Vine, this wine isn't fully ready to reveal its aromatic charms. Notes of dried herb, green olive, licorice, earth and boysenberry are out in front of brooding blue and red fruit. The flavors, however, are in full bloom, with palate-coating, focused and almost creamy cherry and plum notes that persist on the finish.","Red","Syrah","US",29564
"9442","The bouquet on this blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is toasty and elevated, a clear invitation to dig in. In the mouth, the flow is silky smooth and just snappy enough, with finely etched acidity pushing raspberry, plum, herb and cocoa flavors. This is excellent in every way; drink now–2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",9442
"42103","Overripe and pruny, this has a Porty richness and a heavy feeling. It's unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",42103
"28096","This is an extremely faint and subtle rosé, with delicate aromas and flavors of pineapple, tart cherry and orange rind. It's light-weight and thin on the palate, with a clean but fleeting finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",28096
"64634","This wine tastes taut, young and tannic, as ripe red and black cherry are held in by good acidity and strong tannins that give a bite to the mouthfeel. Made from 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, it is full bodied but not heavy, feeling very vibrant and structured.","Red","Red Blend","US",64634
"32979","This structured yet polished wine, made from a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Aglianico and 20% Merlot, opens with intense aromas of tilled earth, mature black fruit, leather, graphite and spice. The Juicy palate offers fleshy blackberry, black currant, black pepper and mineral alongside silky smooth tannins. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2025.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",32979
"33030","Pressed boysenberry aromas highlight simultaneously dark and fresh fruit on the nose of this bottling by Adam Lee, which also conveys Earl Grey tea, lavender, hibiscus and crushed pencils. The palate picks up the same tack, offering delicate fruits and florals, from cranberry to elderflower.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",33030
"32198","Muddy, earthy notes enter the fruity fray of peach on the nose. The palate comes across as clean and zesty. The body is fresh, fruity and easy with an off-dry finish.","White","Gewürztraminer","France",32198
"85064","From vineyards north of the Douro River on the plateau, this wine shows both richness and a fine cool, elegant style. The wood aging has given the wine depth and extra richness, adding to the berry fruits with spice and hints of toast. It's a wine to drink soon, full of fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",85064
"72709","The youngest red in the Couly-Dutheil range is just such pure, exuberant Cabernet Franc. It is perfumed, ripe with black currant fruit and a layered with acidity. Its fruitiness makes it a wine to be drunk young, its tannins giving structure rather than aging potential.","Red","Cabernet Franc","France",72709
"48416","The Red Queen bottling is Evening Land's most limited in terms of production. The grapes are sourced from a block in the estate vineyard at the highest point of the hill, and the wine is aged in 30% new French oak for 14 months. Tasted a few weeks prior to its official release, it was stubbornly unyielding, even after a full 24 hours. Given the pedigree of this estate, and the superb quality of the two other 2010 Pinots, it is reasonable to expect this to come out of its hard shell and earn a much higher score.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",48416
"78376","Easygoing and fresh, this ruby-colored wine offers sweet cherry nuances with lighter aromas of almond and ground cinnamon. It's a cheerful and sunny wine that shows good integrity of fruit and a clean, crisp finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",78376
"42482","Made from a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 15% Alicante, 10% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of black currant, bell pepper and clove. The palate offers mature black cherry, ginger and a hint of vanilla while firm tannins grip the finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",42482
"75787","Haras is the base-level label for Haras de Pirque, and frankly this Chardonnay tastes, smells and feels like a base-level wine. There's a damp lack of clarity on the nose as well as sweet apple, cinnamon and spice flavors. Finishes fleshy and bland.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",75787
"103061","This 100% Merlot wine from 30-year-old vines is one of the producer's limited productions. The wine is superrich in the plump, generous style. Its black-plum fruits give it the weight and ripeness as well as the smooth texture. There is a bite of pepper from the alcohol that spoils the opulent full aftertaste. Drink from 2018.","Red","Merlot","France",103061
"1586","Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",1586
"34098","Earthy with an expansive mouthfeel, this brambly, savory Syrah reveals hints of herb and deep, dark black fruit. It comes from a great vineyard site and is structured to age; give it air before enjoying with a proper cassoulet.","Red","Syrah","US",34098
"60736","Cool and crisp, this tightly herbaceous wine has a concentrated, juicy, green fruit character along with a tangy texture. The fruits are complemented by the tight, acidic aftertaste. Drink from 2014.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",60736
"27545","Stewed prune, leather, violet and clove aromas come together on this. The solid structured palate offers juicy black cherry, raspberry and a hint of star anise alongside youthfully assertive tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink after 2023.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",27545
"13742","There's a minerally, earthy tone from nose to finish on this medium-sweet Riesling, balanced by a palate that's lush in ripe stone fruit and mango flavors. Sharp, laser-focus acidity kicks in on the midpalate, finishing long, with hints of warm spice and honey.","White","Riesling","Germany",13742
"12865","A very tender touch of peach is felt on the nose. On the palate it is bright lemon freshness that takes over. Despite the lemony concentration on the dry taut palate, there is a wonderfully light touch. A zesty edge of pleasantly bitter pith accentuates the citrus freshness perfectly. This is luminous and refreshing, vivid and bright. The finish is totally citrus-focused and lip-smackingly moreish. Drink 2017–2035.","White","Riesling","France",12865
"19427","Smooth and supple, this mix of Syrah, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec offers generous mixed berry fruit in a fresh, enjoyable style. What's missing is a sense of focus, rather than just blending of four disparate grapes.","Red","Red Blend","US",19427
"29690","Cinsault dominant, with Grenache and Rolle (or Vermentino), this is an enjoyable sipper of tart cherry and strawberry, with a delicate blossom note lingering underneath. Pair this with a some relaxation on a porch on a hot summer day.","Rosé","Rosé","US",29690
"5383","A pink-meets-tan color is the greeting on this peachy Pinot Grigio that smells like fresh applesauce. A spunky palate of stone fruit and moderate acidity deals additional notes of waxy melon.","White","Pinot Grigio","Chile",5383
"93474","Soft, supple and structured, this wine is richly crafted in pencil shavings and cedar, with denser, fuller flavors of red cherry and raspberry. With a bite of burly power, it contains 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot.","Red","Merlot","US",93474
"86688","This Riserva expression of Merlot from cool-climate Alto Adige delivers fantastic intensity and purity. The aromas of cherry, spice, leather and red rose are chiseled and crisp. The wine is soft and velvety in the mouth with a long parade of berry fruit flavors on the long finish. Serve this wine with sophisticated meat dishes or cellar age five to ten more years.","Red","Merlot","Italy",86688
"47465","This tropical mélange of fruit and blossoms lives up to its equally ebullient packaging. While deft in body, it bounds from the glass with floral perfume and juicy watermelon and cherry flavors. It's zesty and bold yet spry and fresh—an aptly named accompaniment to summer.","Rosé","Rosé","US",47465
"41800","This wine has a lovely rustic component that suggests forested earth and leaves. Juicy and explosive in cardamom and black cherry flavors, it offers a full-bodied experience of ripeness and concentration.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",41800
"46528","Perbacco is a beautiful expression of Nebbiolo with soft, linear harmony and well defined aromas of black fruit, cola, spice and leather. It tastes compact and firm on the tongue and offers a long, delicious finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",46528
"6908","This low-alcohol offering exhibits less weight and richness as a result. Still, it's a pleasant, lean white that relies on lemony flavors to provide crisp refreshment.","White","Pinot Grigio","New Zealand",6908
"88050","Rich and dense, this is a ripe, wood-aged wine, now showing maturity. It has weight, red berry fruits and a firmer structure of tannins. It is ready to drink, but could age another year.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",88050
"68989","This ripe wine fully expresses the fruitiness of the vintage while also having a firm, tannic structure. It does need to age, although juicy black currant is already showing through. Wait until 2017.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",68989
"82931","Supple and inviting, from the nose of flowers and dark fruits, to the chocolatey tannins that lick the back of the throat, this is a fully-realized, smooth and most accessible red wine.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",82931
"9468","A good Pinot Noir for everyday drinking. It's very dry and crisp and silky in the mouth, with complex flavors of cherries, cola, licorice and beef jerky. The acidity suggests rich, oily fare, like lamb or salmon.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",9468
"4158","Slightly funky scents of asphalt and sweaty socks come along with graphite, pressed blackberry and New Mexico chile. The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",4158
"84895","A delicious Grenache sourced from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Vineyards, a high-elevation, cool-climate site with a peppery opening note that extends itself through dense chewy tannins and the bright fruitiness and inviting aromatics we all love about Grenache. A very nice bottle of wine with great backbone and depth that should age another 5–10 years.","Red","Grenache","US",84895
"37836","A tight, steely and fresh wine, this is dominated by grapefruit, citrus and nervy acidity. A strongly herbaceous character gives a fruity, crisp aftertaste. The blend is Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillion and Muscadelle.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",37836
"75502","Dark and earthy, a thick, heavy wine with plummy, chocolatey flavors and big tannins, although the acidity is soft. The main drawback is residual sugar. Once that sugar hits, the palate is discombobulated.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",75502
"46624","Montesei shows authentic Soave Classico aromas of pear, stone fruit and dusty mineral at the back. Aged only in stainless steel in order to maintain its aromatic freshness, the wine feels smooth and richer than you'd expect on the palate.","White","Garganega","Italy",46624
"64100","For all the richness, and there's plenty of it in the pineapple, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla notes, this Chard has a gunmetal minerality that grounds it. The “Nu” designation indicates that it's unoaked.","White","Chardonnay","US",64100
"92511","Searching for New World Chardonnay that's restrained, crisp and only 12% abv? Steve Webber at De Bortoli is your man. This medium-bodied Chardonnay displays a hint of custard to its texture, while the flavors are citrus driven and refreshing.","White","Chardonnay","Australia",92511
"48356","This 100% varietal brings a fruit-forward profile of candied red currants, cranberry and spice. It has fresh, medium-bodied flavors, with the concentration a bit wanting.","Red","Merlot","US",48356
"77283","Neutral on the nose to the point of dull and mute. The palate is more wet than complex, and the flavors of apple, candy and toffee are basic at best. For a half-bottle priced at $25, this is underwhelming and far too simple in all facets.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Chile",77283
"8636","A Châteauneuf-style blend, based on Grenache, that's clean, fresh and savory. It shows cherry, currant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped into a soft texture. Oak adds a pleasant, subtle note of smoke.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",8636
"88035","Tastes like the grapes really struggled to get ripe in this chilly vintage. The wine is bone dry and tantalizing in acidity, with green flavors of chlorophyll and gooseberry that just manage to veer into Meyer lemons. Difficult on its own, but gains a few  points for elegance and a clean, steely minerality.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",88035
"90388","Melon and pineapple fruit flavors offer something a little different from other white varieties, and while the wine is full and round in the mouth, it remains focused on the finish, a touch of honey balanced by citrusy notes. Drink now.","White","Viognier","Australia",90388
"26230","Ripe red fruits in a warm, soft texture. It's a finely balanced wine that hits all the buttons with its fruity character, touch of spice and  fresh acidity to finish.","Rosé","Rosé","France",26230
"100286","The nose does not give too much away. But the palate holds grapefruit zest cushioned by red fruit aromas that are reminiscent of rosehip and hibiscus tea. Lovely, grown-up, restrained and serious enough for food with lasting length and elegance.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",100286
"5568","A wine launched to celebrate the foundation of Krems (Chremisa) in 995, this full-bodied, rich wine is packed with tropical fruits, just a touch of spice and a rounded texture. Flavors are of pineapple, mango, apricots and melon. The ripe acidity gives a great finishing lift.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",5568
"50742","Full-bodied, rich and slightly warm, this assertive Tavel boasts notes of raspberry, peach and melon. It's a bold, fruit-driven style that brightens on the finish, where crisp acids and a chalky feel add texture.","Rosé","Rosé","France",50742
"28016","This is an easy, gentle wine to drink now. It's softly tannic and dry, with cherry, red currant and cocoa flavors. Shows enough complexity to warrant pairing with an upscale steak.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",28016
"105971","From a vintage that pushes the fruit out in front, this is loaded with tart, tangy blackberry, boysenberry and huckleberry flavors. At first stiff and compact, it blooms open to reveal streaks of sandalwood, sassafras, iron filings and clean earth. It's a high-wire wine with aging potential at least until 2030.","Red","Syrah","Canada",105971
"65118","Giuseppe Rinaldi awes and amazes with the Cannubi-San Lorenzo-Ravera Barolo, but is slightly less successful with this wine from the Brunate and Le Coste crus. The wine is lively and fresh but is also less intense on the nose. The mouthfeel is dominated (at this early stage) by thick, bitter tannins that will no doubt soften with time.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",65118
"69081","Light as gossamer, this nimble off-dry Riesling enlivens the palate with delicate bursts of lemon and lime accented by blossom and pear. Brisk and clean on the finish, it's best enjoyed for it's youthful refreshment.","White","Riesling","Germany",69081
"20612","From Sardinia, this is a delightful rosé made with native grapes. It offers strawberry, crushed cherry and myrtle berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a slightly sweet finish.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",20612
"99671","A late-harvest blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Sémillon from a good year for botrytis, this is dark gold in color. It offers sweet, lush and satisfying swaths of dried apple and orange that linger on the palate, finished with a drop of honey.","White","White Blend","US",99671
"5649","Heady aromas of yellow stone fruit, grapefruit and a touch of light baking spice lead the way. The full-bodied palate shows apricot, yellow peach, mineral and a hint of nutmeg alongside lively acidity that leaves a tangy finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",5649
"25011","Aromas of mature plum, blackberry, toasted oak and vanilla carry over to the palate along with coffee and espresso. Raspy wood tannins give an astringent finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",25011
"19536","An astonishing Pinot Gris, certainly among the best ever made in Oregon, this rich, luscious, mouthcoating wine is totally irresistible. Chardonnay-like unctuousness, ripe pear and apple fruit, plus hints of honey, butter and spice make it practically a meal in itself.","White","Pinot Gris","US",19536
"68016","This boxed Malbec is burgundy-colored and opens with spicy reedy aromas of dried herbs and red-berry fruits. On the palate, this is tight but shallow in the midtier. Flavors of baked plum and berry fruits come with a note of cocoa powder prior to a stable finish.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",68016
"91859","Sweetly forward in blackberry, cherry and raspberry fruit, this Cabernet's buttered oak adds to the impression of candy. It's a tasty wine, and it wants to accompany foods that have a sweetness to them, like pork or beef with caramelized onions.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",91859
"25824","The nose is rather closed but eventually reveals red berry, rose, cake spice and a whiff of leather. It's young but balanced, with bracing tannins and bright acidity that support the tart sour cherry, white pepper and sage flavors. It closes on a mocha note. Drink 2018–2027.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",25824
"65018","A small percentage of Petit Verdot helps darken this wine, a touch of saddle and leather at the fore of the aroma. From there, inky blackberry and plum jockey for position against the solid oak and firm-grained tannin, a call out for steak clearly heard.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",65018
"5936","This shows good crispness, with an apple flavor and zesty acidity. The fruitiness is balanced by a mineral edge and a touch of caramel.","White","Chardonnay","France",5936
"24919","This delicate wine exudes swathes of lemon chiffon and white flowers, offering similar experiences on the palate. Staying light in oak, it has texture and body to spare, without ever overpowering, making for a food-friendly, versatile wine.","White","Chardonnay","US",24919
"48693","This variety is an extreme rarity in the state but shows plenty of promise in this nascent growing region. Aromas of cherry, herb and spice lead to broad tart full cherry flavors that show a sense of purity, finesse and length.","Red","Zweigelt","US",48693
"93504","Aromas of lees and buttercup come with a hint of tropical fruit. This fading, Albariño is plump and generic in feel, without much cut or minerality. Melon, apple and pithy citrus flavors finish similarly, with mild bitterness.","White","Albariño","Spain",93504
"23191","Dark alpine strawberry and black plum notes converge on the nose of this wine, which also offers a tart element. Vivacious black raspberry, pencil lead, crushed vanilla, clove and a slight herbal edge show on the palate, proving to be a more savory rather than fruity take on Zin.","Red","Zinfandel","US",23191
"103273","Nervy on the bouquet, with forceful, fiery red berry scents. The mouthfeel is fresh and clacky, while flavors of red plum and dry blackberry are solid and clean. Offers a dusting of light oak and spice on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",103273
"21264","This wine is uncomplicated in approach, light bodied enough to be food-friendly and approachable. It has notions of apple and tropical fruit at its core.","White","Chardonnay","US",21264
"66852","As light in color and silky in texture as a Pinot Noir, with refined tannins and a fine burst of acidity. The flavors are characterized by the cherries and raspberries associated with Grenache, along with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, bacon and a floral note. The alcohol is a little too high for comfort or ageability.","Red","Grenache","US",66852
"56163","With a high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured wine, the freshness coming from intense blackberries. Spice and bitter coffee flavors mingle with the tannins, promising some good aging for the vintage.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",56163
"81678","This is a firm wine, tightly-wound, with whiffs of mineral and cement. Plum and cherry flavors mingle with notes of dried herb, earth and brown spice. The wine rolls along into a lengthy finish, with excellent body and balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",81678
"75724","Basic berry and plum aromas are a bit foxy and herbal. This feels choppy and scratchy due to raw tannins. Generic black-fruit flavors are short and salty, while this ends with a clipped feel and medicinal berry flavors.","Red","Malbec","Chile",75724
"43662","Bright, jammy aromas and ripe, lively, chocolate and cherry flavors give a lot of personality to this velvet-textured wine. Medium to full bodied, it has a good blanket of fine tannins to coat the tongue and give the wine grip.","Red","Malbec","US",43662
"84334","Crisp and steely, this is a bright and fruity wine. It has a tight texture cut with acidity and citrus flavors. The wine is lively, packed with fruitiness that has a delicious refreshing aftertaste. Drink from late 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",84334
"17715","A big, warm, baked wine made from Merlot, Garnacha, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon. It has baked aromas in front of a full, balanced palate that hits with dark fruit, molasses and warmth. Does a good job of blending ripe black fruit and chocolate with proper tannins and acidity. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",17715
"74919","This wine is ripe, with good balance between acidity and the rich yellow fruits. It has a lightly tangy character, although it is more about delicious juiciness and a warm, generous character that is lightly sustained by toast. Drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",74919
"78979","For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",78979
"104809","This opens with simple fruit tones of cherry and cassis backed by evolved aromas of spice, leather and cola. It shows impressive purity and a long, silky finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",104809
"14733","This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel. The smoked meat, charcuterie and blue-fruit flavors don't hold back, bringing a lovely sense of texture and detail. It's an intense wine that completely demands your attention.","Red","Syrah","US",14733
"100400","Innocuous red fruit and a density of baked plum provide a fruity plushness in this travel-size wine, 100% varietal with ample tannin.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",100400
"13983","Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.","Red","Red Blend","Argentina",13983
"33567","Blended by Jean-René Matignon, technical director of Château Pichon Baron, this is a smooth, ripe wine with balanced wood and spice flavors. They give weight to berry fruits, rich plums and fragrant acidity at the end. Drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",33567
"75851","Crushed iris, baked plum, cedar, tobacco and new leather aromas seamlessly come together on this bold full-bodied red. Smooth and ripe, the full-bodied palate doles out mature black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and mocha framed in well-knit, velvety tannins. Drink 2018 through 2026.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",75851
"45230","For whatever reason, Keating's 2010 Zin represents a vast improvement over the '09. It's a pretty, polished Zinfandel, the kind called claret-style to distinguish its elegance and balance. Classic Dry Creek Valley, with wild berry, cola, sweet tobacco and spice flavors and briary tannins.","Red","Zinfandel","US",45230
"41968","A pale wine with almost sugary flavors. It has a strawberry fruit character and soft acidity.","Rosé","Rosé","France",41968
"68803","This is prototypical Gisborne Chardonnay, featuring a whack of spicy oak and buttered popcorn allied to tropical-fruit and peach flavors, brought into focus by mild citrus (tangerine) on the finish. A very fruity and somewhat simple style, yet executed perfectly.","White","Chardonnay","New Zealand",68803
"70079","This is a ripe, vigorous young Petite Sirah. It's strong in tannins, with just enough acidity to make the black currant, roasted meat, plum and cedar flavors bright. This needs time; give it 5–6 years, and it should glide through 2020.","Red","Petite Sirah","US",70079
"57326","From a tiny patch in the tiny Guenoc Valley, where the Langtry winery lies, this Sauvignon Blanc is partially barrel fermented, and it shows in the texture. In taste, expect Mandarin orange and melon, along with acidity that's high and mighty.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",57326
"16457","Rich, deliciously fruity and ripe, this combines warmth with a more mineral undertow that cuts through the palate, creating a wine that is refreshing and mouth-filling. It would be worth aging for two years or more.","White","Chardonnay","France",16457
"29636","Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",29636
"3046","This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish.","White","Pinot Grigio","Australia",3046
"31902","Vegetal and metallic on the nose, this Verdejo fails to improve as it goes along. It's dilute in feel, with celery and grassy flavors. It finishes bitter and flabby.","White","Verdejo","Spain",31902
"102887","While hints of earth and bramble on the nose seem a touch savory, the palate of this concentrated semi-dry wine is richly flavored with fresh peach, orange and apricot. It's juicy and fresh, accented by soft orange acidity and a brisk finish. Drink now through 2018 to enjoy its fruity vitality.","White","Riesling","US",102887
"73843","Ken Wright recently sold the vineyard to Angela Estate, but continues to make these wines for the owners. The 2013 is sleek and refined, with pristine clarity. Let it breathe and it warms into nicely rounded flavors of cherry fruit, along with highlights of orange peel and pekoe tea. Finishing notes suggest coffee grounds and dark chocolate.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",73843
"98451","This opens with earthy, almost funky aromas of game, leather, blue flower and tilled soil. The palate offers red cherry, black raspberry and baking spices balanced by brisk acidity and firm tannins. Drink now through 2016.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",98451
"102384","This wine tastes heavy and rounded, with whiffs of petroleum and peppermint on the entry that settle down over time. With ripe fruit and oak at its core, it's a wine for fans of a more generous style.","White","Chardonnay","US",102384
"15871","This pure varietal wine conjures up apple and pear juice, finished dry and crisply defined. There is no particular nuance to it, but it's well made and quite quaffable.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",15871
"55444","The wine is dry, soft, elegant and lovely, with full-bodied black cherry, currant, red licorice and cola flavors. It certainly is one of the best Syrahs you can buy at this price.","Red","Syrah","US",55444
"76431","This red blend of 59% Zinfandel, 20% Petite Sirah, 14% Syrah and 7% Malbec has depth and concentration, as well as length. It has flavors of black and red berries, accented by cinnamon.","Red","Red Blend","US",76431
"100234","Big, full-bodied and very much a product of the 2010 vintage, this structured, generous wine needs time. The dry tannins are still prominent, giving a tough edge to the more generous, concentrated fruits. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",100234
"60393","Whiffs of white pepper and fresh young pine trees give nuance to the supple raspberry and wild red-berry fruit aromas on the nose of this bottling. It's light in body and texture once sipped, so throw a chill on it to enjoy the nice anise notes, juniper character and pomegranate backbone.","Red","Grenache","US",60393
"54507","Amber to the eye, this wine features an enticing bouquet of almond blossom and toffee. It is slightly chalky on the palate, with a sophisticated mélange of baked apple, peach, smoked meat and pencil-lead flavors. A touch of brightness marks the soft finish.","White","White Blend","",54507
"74137","This easy-drinking wine has a bouquet of honeydew melon and lime juice. Flavors of lemon, tangerine, guava and white peach with a soft hint of baking spice continue into the finish, which is marked by flavors of stone fruits and nutmeg.","White","Chardonnay","Israel",74137
"76403","This blend of Incrocio Manzoni, Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto opens with tutti frutti aromas of ripe banana, pineapple and pear that carry over to the palate, along with mango. The savory palate also has a certain salinity that restrains the exuberant fruit.","White","White Blend","Italy",76403
"97046","An easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc thats fermented in barrel and stainless steel, this has a depth of pear, tangerine and lime flavors. Creamy and rich, it will make a consistent companion to most fish dishes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",97046
"89341","Raw oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean aromas carry over to the palate along with licorice and espresso but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent, grainy tannins clench the bracing finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",89341
"74908","From grapes grown near the town of Los Alamos comes this wine from a San Diego-based family. Complex aromas suggest red cherry, blackberry, shiitake mushroom and black peppercorn. The palate is tighter, with cranberry, tart yet dark raspberry, iodine and sanguine flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",74908
"27265","A little on the sharp, green and minty side, with tart acids framing cherry, black raspberry and smoky wood flavors. A good wine that could use more lushness and richness.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27265
"55671","Feels a bit too soft for balance and aging, but otherwise a charming wine. Dry and silky, it offers complex flavors of cola, black raspberries, figs, cinnamon and sandalwood, with a long, spicy finish. Now–2012.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",55671
"102653","Aromas recall pressed rose petal, tilled earth and a whiff of sage. The soft palate doles out raspberry jam, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. There isn't much complexity but it's fresh and already enjoyable. Drink through 2019.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",102653
"92754","Dusty red fruit dominates in this otherwise muted, mellowed and somewhat demure estate wine, soft in texture and approach that cranks in acidity.","Red","Malbec","US",92754
"47088","From a small region just north of Pouilly Fumé, this is light and fruity. It's soft, just herbaceous and full of green apple and grapefruit flavors that give a fresh, lively character. It's completely ready to drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",47088
"28362","A bouquet of spicy black pepper intoxicates on the opening of this wine, followed by captivating waves of savory blackberry, leather and dust. The grapes are sourced from one of the producer's coolest sites, With well-integrated, unobtrusive oak, the wine is soft and delicious now, offering plenty of meaty undertones, but will intrigue further over time, through 2022.","Red","Syrah","US",28362
"86062","Ripe and flashy, this Cabernet is a bit rustic now. The vineyard is quite high up in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the flavors show that intense, mountain concentration of blackberries and cherries. Without history to refer to, it's hard to predict this wine's future, but you might consider cellaring it for 6–8 years to see what happens.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",86062
"28083","A coppery orange color, this opens with aromas of mealy melon, peach and strawberry. The palate is a departure from the nose—surprisingly astringent in tart currant and red-plum skin flavors that finish sharp and fast.","Rosé","Rosé","France",28083
"69800","Brooding and powerful, this ripe and regionally representative blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre shows caramelized blueberry, chocolate sauce, crème brûlée and coffee bean on the nose. It hits the palate with density that masks the fruit at first, and then unleashes waves of fudge, elderberry, blackberry, licorice and jet-black coffee laced with black cassis.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",69800
"88232","This wine's fruity aromas of red cherry and strawberry carry over to its bright, juicy palate together with black pepper notes. It's savory and easygoing, with round tannins that make it ready to enjoy soon.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",88232
"103995","The palate is subdued with modest apple and lemon notes, but brisk lemon-lime acidity and a hint of white florals adds some complexity. Dry and full bodied on the palate, it's an easy white to accompany everyday dinners of fish or chicken.","White","Chardonnay","US",103995
"82349","This is a potentially juicy wine with acidity and red fruits coming through the structure. It has the weight for the tannins and a rich background feel. Drink starting from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",82349
"1065","Rubbery berry and plum aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is juicy, bright and focused, with good raspberry and plum fruit. Textural balance is an attribute, while the finish is round, lively and full of tasty berry flavors. Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",1065
"30435","Waxy papaya and melon aromas maintain freshness despite this getting on in age. A lean, snappy palate is par for the variety and origin, while tangy tangerine and lemon flavors finish sharp and whispy. Drink now.","White","White Blend","Spain",30435
"94809","Highly intriguing aromas of forest floor, damp pine trees and blackberry reduction sauce power the nose on this blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec. The flavors are quite broad and welcoming, with purple and blue fruits, but also herbs of oregano and thyme. It's tasty but not showy, a wine that's happy in its own skin.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",94809
"86694","One for the cellar. It's dry and locked down in hard tannins, the kind that sting your gums. Even so, they can't quite mask the torrents of blackberry and currant fruit. It's strong, intense and dazzling. Lay this young wine down until at least 2015.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",86694
"16299","This starts out with textbook aromas of red and black fruits that are pure and easy to get into. It shows kick on the palate, with oaky flavors of coffee and chocolate that accent ripe berry and mild herb notes. It's toasty and spicy on the finish, with a gritty feel.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",16299
"4020","Slightly sour and funky in earth, this is a restrained white aged in a majority of stainless steel, in addition to smaller percentages of oak and acacia. Crisp and minerally, marked by stone fruit as well as citrus, it finishes rich in caramel and vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","US",4020
"98772","Rich, ripe and fruity, this wine wears its tannins easily. With layers of acidity, red-berry fruit and a dark, dry core, the wine is impressive and set to age. The aftertaste is both sweet with the generous fruit and dry with tannins, finishing firmly. Drink from 2020.","Red","Pinot Noir","France",98772
"94462","Stagecoach Cabs are always impressive for their power and depth, but this one seems like Stagecoach on steroids. It's insanely rich and extracted with blackberry and cherry jam flavors, along with plenty of sweet oak. It's so rich, it could use 7–8 years to calm down.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",94462
"87588","Offers mild berry fruit allied to some green bell pepper and herb aromas.  A bit light and tart fo a single vineyrd wine, but still good.","Red","Merlot","US",87588
"3186","This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",3186
"3508","The smoky, spicy aromas and richly oaked flavors of this medium-bodied wine are tempting and delicious. While the wine's personality comes mostly from new oak nuances, good fruit flavors lie underneath.","Red","Red Blend","US",3508
"34215","With attractive wood flavors, this is a wine with spice, toast and citrus flavors. Orange and yellow fruits come through the lime acidity and zesty texture. Drink from 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",34215
"51517","If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity. Waves of honey and tropical fruit coat the mouth, wonderfully balanced by zesty acidity, and while it is sweet and lush it never seems cloying or heavy. Delicious now–2015, at least.","White","Riesling","Germany",51517
"95433","Black cherry fruit with a bit of black olive and a hint of smoke lead quickly into an oaky finish with plenty of roasted coffee and tobacco flavors. A lot of barrel, but the fruit is simple, not distinctively varietal.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",95433
"32889","Lusty, deep Malbec from Patagonia. The nose is a puddle of rich berry, spice and chocolate, while the palate is snappy and alert even if the flavors veer toward roasted black fruits, sweetness, cola and sautéed mushroom. A bit tannic and biting on the finish, with earth and oak standing out.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",32889
"40446","Enticing aromas of blueberry syrup open this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Melnik, Syrah and Petit Verdot. Flavors of cherry, tart cherry pie, blueberry and red raspberry come with a burst of acidity before the persistent finish.","Red","Red Blend","",40446
"16533","The Vila Santa Reserva boasts wood aging as well as lush, rich fruitiness. The touch of woody spice emphasizes the green- and white-fruits that give this rounded wine a full texture. There is a plush feel that promises some aging, although the wine can be enjoyed now.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",16533
"35508","This wine starts off well, with a pretty nose and fruit that shows nice ripeness. But once in the mouth all the fruit seems to disappear, and the wine falls flat.","White","Riesling","US",35508
"99763","There's tremendous fruit on this Zinfandel, mostly of the red and black forest berry type. It's also spicy, showing Zin's cinnamon, nutmeg and white pepper notes. The criticism is that high alcohol makes it feel hot and finish glyceriney sweet.","Red","Zinfandel","US",99763
"64132","This inky, concentrated bruiser opens with lemony oak, graphite, earth tones and deep black-fruit aromas. Like the nose, the palate is intense and ripe as Tinto Fino gets, with smooth, manageable tannins. Flavors of blackberry, prune, cassis, lemon rind and tobacco end with power, class and depth; drink from 2017–2027.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",64132
"97541","Arresting and perfumed, this wine displays aromas of stargazer lilies, fire pit, tapenade and smoked meat, displaying exquisite nuance and detail.

It displays a rare sense of delicacy and intensity that is breathtaking.","Red","Syrah","US",97541
"106506","Whiffs of crushed minerals and smoke lend nuance to this dry yet intensely fruity wine full of Meyer lemon, peach and melon flavors. It's brisk and dancing on the palate with a bracing hit of lime acidity that lingers towards a long, steely finish.","White","Riesling","US",106506
"41316","Here's a classic example of why Americans are buying Pinot Grigio. The wine is marked by fresh, zesty acidity that cleanses the palate and is so compatible with things like goat cheese and grilled veggies. Very slightly sweet, it shows flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, pineapples and clover honey.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",41316
"72682","The 2010 vintage wines from Washington can be unforgiving on release but this wine—already a full five years old—is an exception. It shows a compelling assortment of jammy red and black fruit along with milk chocolate and barrel spices. The flavors convey both power and finesse with a spot-on sense of balance and a long finish that kicks it up a notch. It's drinking beautifully now but has a long life in front of it. Best from 2020 to 2027.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",72682
"72818","This wine is jam in a bottle. Floods the mouth with ripe, spicy flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries, wrapped into a light, silky texture.","Red","Zinfandel","US",72818
"51430","This is a layered, earthy selection, with upfront aromas of leather and cigar box complemented by fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The medium-weight palate is lush and velvety, and the tannins are fine yet firmly structured. Boysenberry preserves and black pepper linger on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","South Africa",51430
"101176","This progressive domaine in Tavel reaches into neighboring Lirac for this wine, which is a high 70% Cinsault (the balance is Grenache). It's fresh and citrusy despite having ample weight, ending on a zesty note.","Rosé","Rosé","France",101176
"79281","This is a delightful and fresh Chianti, with a fragrance of violet, cherry and a whiff of underbrush. The palate offers bright wild cherry and raspberry along with notes of white pepper. Pair this with hearty Tuscan soups or grilled steaks.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",79281
"6606","Sourced from the Dineen vineyard, this is unusually tart, almost sour, and feels thin on the palate. Some citrus flavors combine with a light touch of body powder, but overall it comes through as a very racy, light white wine.","White","Riesling","US",6606
"8353","Tastes hot and prickly in alcohol, which puts everything else off, including the black cherry, bacon, olive and herb flavors, which are actually pretty good. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",8353
"105133","Aromas of espresso, underbrush and black-skinned fruit lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, mature plum, clove, coffee and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2018.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",105133
"59914","A rather earthy pull envelopes the fruit: both of dried apple and fresh, ripe pear. The palate adds a honeyed tone to this and a fluid richness that glides like silk across the palate. All is fringed with pleasantly bitter hints of crushed apple seeds, creating appetizing tension between sweet and bitter poles. This really holds your attention.","White","Pinot Gris","France",59914
"99625","Underbrush, sunbaked soil, toast, and espresso aromas come together in the glass. The structured, tightly wound palate shows star anise, dried black cherry and a note of powdered sage with bracing tannins that grip the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",99625
"70030","There is, as usual with Pinots from Garys', a lusty, almost overwhelming quality to the wine. It's a full frontal assault of flavor, with cascades of cherries, raspberries, cola, licorice, sweet leather and smoky char that go on and on. It's an achievement, but what the wine has in directness, it's missing in subtlety. Drink this big, bold California Pinot Noir now, or hold through 2010.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",70030
"50864","This single-vineyard Cabernet is softening and mellowing, with flavors of cherry, mocha and oak that are picking up sweet, mushroomy, gamy notes. Carmel Valley is a small appellation in a warm part of inland Monterey County that specializes in Bordeaux red wines. It's drinking well now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",50864
"1054","A bit scratchy up front, with some heat and rubber to the bouquet. Feels bold, grippy and alive, with lightly herbal flavors of roasted berry and leather. Herbal and blackened on the finish; ripe but basic in quality.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",1054
"91596","This blend of 53% Mourvèdre, 42% Grenache and 5% Cinsault mixes up fresh raspberry fruit aromas with mint, light licorice, charred meats, white pepper, lavender and bouquet garni. The palate centers on strawberry and raspberry, balanced by plum-peel tannins and seasoned with sage, anise and chaparral herbs. It's a very versatile Rhône blend.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","US",91596
"9686","This wine is equal parts Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas and off-dry flavors of grass and fig seem a bit muddled but still bring enjoyment.","White","White Blend","US",9686
"10291","A blend of 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this delivers ripe blackberry, black cherry, red currant and vanilla flavors with a hint of mocha. Firm, round tannins balance the juicy palate.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",10291
"60400","Pure and friendly tart apple and sweet pear fruit are very appetizing. The palate emphasises fruity sweetness but is kept in check and balance. Residual sweetness will make this shine in certain food contexts while the backbone of bright, citric acidity provides a great counterpoint.","White","Pinot Gris","France",60400
"19241","This is a simple, slightly sweet wine. It tastes like a pineapple, lime and vanilla pastry melted down into wine, with alcohol giving heat, and acidity to make it crisp.","White","Roussanne","US",19241
"2092","Wiry cherry and herb aromas are fresh and reedy. This Rioja feels crisp and mildly astringent. Quick, punchy flavors of plum and wild berry fruits turn more oaky prior to a finish that's fresh and forward, with hard tannins. Drink through 2021.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",2092
"48234","This wine leads with tire rubber, bacon, forest floor, juniper and blackberry aromas, requiring as much air or time as you can give. In the mouth, it's hard, tannic and almost astringent. A mix of oak and herb-laced black fruit flavors finishes long, with plenty of energy and power in reserve. Drink 2018–2027.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",48234
"71967","This bargain Sauvignon is leafy and intense on the nose, with fig, ripe citrus and herbal overtones on the palate. It's plump and round, and decently concentrated for the price.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",71967
"13826","Herbal aromas of bell pepper and pimiento include tree bark and eucalyptus notes. A choppy, raw mouthfeel makes for edgy flavors of tomato sauce, green herbs and olive, while a crisp finish tastes mostly of green herbs and chocolate.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",13826
"26279","Right from the beginning, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend oozes old-school Chilean calling cards: The nose is full of eucalyptus and herbal berry aromas along with tobacco and spicy berry scents. A tannic, heavy palate is hard and grinding, while baked flavors of black fruits come with a reprise of herbaceous character. Drink through 2022.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",26279
"44380","Aromas of pressed honeysuckle and orchard fruit lead the nose while the vibrant savory palate doles out ripe peach, yellow apple and a hint of lemon zest. An almond note lends a pleasantly bitter finish.","White","White Blend","Italy",44380
"90542","Stone fruit-fuzz and sugar apple combine along a freeway of thick texture and voluptuous flavor in this full-bodied white, aged in both new and neutral French barrels. Creamy vanilla adds additional richness and texture as it finishes strong and ripe.","White","Chardonnay","US",90542
"69153","Here's a pristine and tonic Pinot Grigio from northern Italy presented in equally clean packaging. The wine delivers a crystalline appearance that is accented by measured aromas of citrus, light peach and white flower.","White","Pinot Grigio","Italy",69153
"9865","Remo Farina is an excellent operation (now taken over by the next generation and currently undergoing a winery refurbishment) and the estate's beautiful Monte Fante Amarone is thickly extracted with mature aromas of black fruit, apple, cola and exotic spice. The wine offers character and pizzazz thanks to the polished quality of its tannins.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",9865
"47276","This bottling, which is bolstered by 9% Malbec, 3% Merlot and 2% Carmenère, shows rounded black currant, blueberry, smoked beef and graphite on the nose. Soft tannins make for an elegant presentation, with heavy black-fruit flavors of crème de cassis and dark chocolate.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",47276
"49767","Light and clear in color and texture, this wine is both slightly sour and sweet, swerving between savory leather and clove notes and a more ripe aspect of black cherry and strawberry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",49767
"78817","Curious tones of red berry and grapefruit mark this intensely fruit-forward, semi-sweet Riesling. It's concentrated on the palate, but balanced with hints of smoky minerality and delicate dried herb notes.","White","Riesling","US",78817

"83341","Once again, here is a Seven Hills wine that opens with truly lovely aromatics. It's a clean varietal expression of Syrah, with medium weight, wild berries and finishing highlights of pepper, earth, sea salt, baking spices and cassis.","Red","Syrah","US",83341
"41335","From Duckhorn, a very serious producer, but this is their fun wine. Not to say this blend of Zin, Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc isn't a heavyweight red. It is, with massive berry, cherry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors. But it seems designed for easier fare, such as barbecue. At its best over the next 5 years.","Red","Red Blend","US",41335
"52808","Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored.","White","Chardonnay","US",52808
"43439","This unoaked Chardonnay is so ripe and rich, you won't miss the buttered-toast flavor of oak. It's incredibly potent with limes, mangoes, oranges and pineapples, uplifted with brisk acidity. A weekend brunch of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon will be the perfect occasion.","White","Chardonnay","US",43439
"66881","Tight, textured and crisp, this shows the freshness of the 2013 vintage while missing some of the natural spice of Pinot Gris. It's all about sliced green apples lightly brushed with pepper, with crisp acidity at the end. Drink now.","White","Pinot Gris","France",66881
"27215","Plum, cinnamon, Chinese five spice, egg nog, strawberry compote and sour cherry team up for a memorable nose. The palate proves more straight-ahead and savory, with sandalwood up front and fleshy plum, cooked rhubarb and some strawberry in the background.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",27215
"8816","Aromas of ripe dark berry, exotic spice, tobacco and an anise note lead the nose on this intense wine. The succulent palate delivers layers of blackberry, raspberry, clove, licorice and allspice. Tightly-knit but velvety tannins provide support.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",8816
"38102","Poggio al Vento (from the 2004 vintage) shows smoky and savory notes of forest floor, bramble, cured meat, barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce. The wine is compact in the mouth, with polished tannins.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",38102
"18949","The aromatics jump out, an intriguing mix of cherry fruit, leather, coffee and mocha. This is a block selection, and as such it is both precise and also a bit wanting in the midpalate. With ample aeration it fills in, finishing with dark fruit, roasted tannins and a little heat.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18949
"18173","A low-intensity wine with dull apricot aromas and mild oxidization. Riesling is the base grape, but the wine is mildy Sherried and honeyed, with burnt orange as the lead flavor. Heavy orange and apricot flavors weigh down the short finish.","White","Riesling","Chile",18173
"11051","This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",11051
"48303","Brief skin contact during fermentation gives this appropriately named, single-vineyard (The Benches) rosé it's pretty pale-salmon color. It's immediately appealing, with notes of melon and strawberry, and just a hair off-dry, with a rich, textured feel.","White","Pinot Grigio","US",48303
"69811","While honey and white peach flavors ring pure and sweet, there's a slatey, mineral tone that penetrates deeply in this off-dry Kabinett. It's nervy and brisk, finishing long with zesty lime pith bitterness.","White","Riesling","Germany",69811
"23839","Very tangy in texture, it has spice from wood aging and a crisply fresh character. It is bright and light, and very lemony at the end.","White","Chardonnay","France",23839
"12063","Bell pepper and sharp red fruit aromas provide a shaky start, which is followed by cranberry, tart cherry and other pointed flavors. The feel is racy and tight, with gritty acids. Airing does improve it somewhat. Tasted twice; this is a review of the better bottle. Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc and Carmenère is the blend. From Brazil.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Brazil",12063
"40420","Aromas of white pepper and nettle are about as fresh as it gets. The rest is falling off, with bitterness and oxidation. Acceptable but bland and bitter on the tail end.","White","Verdejo","Spain",40420
"11663","Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect. Acids provide enough spine to keep the palate from drooping, with hints of clove and lemongrass adding interest. A blend of 55% Chardonnay, 45% Viognier.","White","White Blend","US",11663
"80885","This is an authoritative Red Mountain Cabernet, from a rising star with an excellent young vineyard. Great structure and a spine of steel support a tightly-wound core of pure cassis. The tannins are hard but fully ripe, with black olive, coffee grounds and bourbon barrel highlights.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",80885
"88760","Calm aromas of plum, berry fruits and dried spices are composed. This feels solid and ripe, but also energetic. Flavors of chocolaty oak, mocha, baked plum and ripe berry fruits finish with lasting notes of clove and wood spice. Drink through 2022.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",88760
"10497","Reductive at first, this wine opens to show aromas of coffee, dried herbs, carob and eucalyptus, with the barrel notes initially taking the lead followed by blue fruit. The fruit flavors are silky in feel with abundant coffee and plum notes backed by rustic tannins.","Red","Malbec","US",10497
"101181","Light, bright and fresh, this wine is ready to drink. Crisp apple and lemon flavors are lifted by tangy acidity. Juicy and very fruity it has a perfumed aftertaste.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",101181
"34955","Bright berry, rose and baking spice aromas unfold in the glass. The polished palate offers raspberry compote, juicy cherry, licorice, tobacco and chopped herb alongside smooth, velvety tannins. It's already extremely tempting. Drink 2018–2023.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",34955
"12994","Soft and ripe, this is an easy, fruity wine. It has red berries, gentle tannins and attractive acidity. It is just as enjoyable as an apéritif as with food and ready to drink now.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",12994
"42330","Fresh pear notes mix with creamy hints of white flowers, there's a little pear drop, too. The palate is zesty and fresh, light and comes with the slightest, refreshing fizziness. This is light, easy and fun.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",42330
"49463","Mature and smooth, showing brown sugar and caramel sweetness alongside tobacco and soy. Drink now.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",49463
"32712","A juicy, jammy, alcoholic style, tannic and young. This is gutsy, high-toned wine, with fat, extracted fruit. Very dry tannins, good balance. This wine needs time; it's a very different style from the other Claudia Springs Zins. But it shows the same attention to detail, intense fruit, and stylish, sensitive winemaking.","Red","Zinfandel","US",32712
"5274","This unoaked white offers rounded tropical fruit aromas and flavors like pineapple, melon and pear. The style is straightforward and exuberant, with balanced acidity and a fruity, lush finish. Keep on the table for everyday enjoyment.","White","Chenin Blanc","South Africa",5274
"102963","One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",102963
"104188","Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.","White","Torrontés","Argentina",104188
"53322","Made from very ripe grapes harvested as late as November, this Grüner shows us depth despite its light, fresh palate. Creamy notes of yellow plum have the softest touch of vanilla. This has a pliable, sinuous body and is a more thoughtful, rounded but still very fresh rendition of this enduring Austrian favorite.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",53322
"47902","This impresses in graceful red berry, dried herb and wild vanilla, each component complementing the next. Well integrated and well made, this is a lengthy, complex and delicious wine that'll please a range of palates in search of moderate ripeness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",47902
"48977","Cabernet and Merlot are combined in 70-30 proportions. The aromas are elegant and tightly packed: Cherry, blackberry, molasses, maple syrup and tobacco leaf make up the core. The mouthfeel is dense and richly textured thanks to the wine's excellent structure.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",48977
"55512","Mild raspberry and oak aromas make for a timid bouquet. The palate feels edgy and acidic, with herbal, oaky flavors of bramble and red fruit. It tastes resiny on the finish, with high acidity that creates an impression of sharpness.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",55512
"104174","This blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional is rustic with some hard tannins and intense acidity. Since it is still young, the wine could soften but it seems to be more about its structure than its fruit.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",104174
"53654","Made from young vines from the Vaulorent portion of the Fourchaume vineyard, this is an open, rounded and lively wine with white fruits and weight, just lifted by acidity.","White","Chardonnay","France",53654
"64099","Supple and elegant, with complex flavors of red cherries, cola, anise and smoky vanilla, and a sprinkle of orange zest in the finish. The mouthfeel could be a little firmer, but it's a pleasing Pinot for early drinking.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",64099
"40275","This is a late release, but it's in good shape. The nose is earthy and dense, with just a nip of wet fur and forest floor. The palate is all about sweet berries and ripeness, while the finish is warm and lengthy. It's solid and without any obvious flaws even if it doesn't thump its chest and overwhelm you.","Red","Merlot","Chile",40275
"15554","Starting out as a very tannic, closed wine, this is one for the cellar. The question is how long. It's a big, dry, ripe Cab, with extracted blackberry, blueberry and cedar flavors, and while it should soften over the next five years, it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",15554
"52773","Cocoa, coffee, spice and dark fruit aromas are followed by smooth fruit flavors. The barrel influence is primary but this still brings plenty of enjoyment, with good balance and depth of flavor.","Red","Malbec","US",52773
"17088","With residual sugar at 200 g/L, this is much more concentrated than the average wine labeled Late Harvest. With enough acidity to stay focused and avoid any suggestion of syrup, it's an exceptional value. Deep peach and apricot flavors and a hint of caramel linger through a satisfying finish.","White","Riesling","US",17088
"16832","This wine is full of acidity, with a crisp edge that's a delicious part of the riper fruit. The wood-aging spiciness is well judged to give a balanced wine that is generous and ready to drink.","White","Chardonnay","France",16832
"13765","Berry, plum and pastry aromas carry a bit of stalky sweetness. It feels juicy, textured and mildly tannic, with lightly herbal berry and resin flavors. Oaky on the finish, it has a good set of outgoing flavors and length.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",13765
"1849","One sip is all it takes to know this is a terrific Pinot Noir. It's dry, silky and complex, and not only that, it will develop bottle nuance over the next six years. Rich and flamboyant in cherry pie filling, persimmon and mushu-plum sauce flavors, yet layered with earthy, foresty notes of mushrooms, soy sauce and balsam. You can drink it now, but give it an hour or two of decanting.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",1849
"37620","The estate dates back to before the French Revolution. Today, it is run by Philippe Girard who has produced this delightfully crisp wine. Its acidity and its tangy texture show its youthful side. That needs to calm down and broaden out, so wait until 2018.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",37620
"98061","The winery's Gewürztraminers always have a slightly sugary taste, but their 2012 is more evident in that off-dryness than in past vintages, and seems softer, too. It's rich, fruity and spicy, with a honeyed finish that will make it perfect with slightly-sweet Southeast Asian foods.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",98061
"91164","Here is a thick and succulent expression of Brunello di Montalcino with a generous and immediately friendly disposition. The wine is soft, smooth and satisfying with firm tannins and a full delivery of blackberry, cherry and spice.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",91164
"13033","Somehow, in a stellar 2014 lineup, this vineyard designate stands out, as the 2012 did when it was the Wine Enthusiast 2015 wine of the year. Power and precision work in tandem here. The fruit blend conjures up melon, berry, cherry and more, and the oak has the gentlest touch to its presence. There's tremendous midpalate concentration, and the clear sense that this could age for decades. Let's just say drink 2018 through 2030.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",13033
"59575","This ode to the owls that surround the region's vineyard is a compelling mix of Pinot Noir and Grenache that offers juicy cherries and strawberries on the nose alongside smoked meat, allspice, nutmeg and a touch of caramel. The flavors are broad, inviting and rich, with black cherry, blueberry and smoked beef. It's as delicious as it is avant garde.","Red","Red Blend","US",59575
"95322","This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",95322
"85399","This well-made wine, blended with small percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot, is an astounding value. Currant and cranberry notes and an underbelly of tannins play together in a smooth texture of rich concentration.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",85399
"15907","This rich, oaky selection leads with aromas of roasted almonds, honeycomb, yellow apple and apricot preserves. Those notes carry through to the bold, round palate, partnered with assertive flavors of oak spice, toasted challah and buttered popcorn. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","South Africa",15907
"34238","Scents and flavors of sandalwood and root beer come up first, with strawberry and cherry fruit following. Sourced principally from Winter's Hill vineyard, it's a gentle wine that gains momentum through the finish. Slightly reductive burnt rubber notes come in late, but with vigorous aeration the flavors smooth out.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",34238
"70828","This tribute to the winery's wooden basket presses begins with a nose of raw dough, lemon rind and a wet gravel minerality. It's a very evenly spaced wine once sipped, walking a balance between citrus and yeast, yet not going overboard with either.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",70828
"44774","This bottling opens with clean and light yet pure aromas of peach blossoms, beeswax, rounded nectarine and sharper Granny Smith apple-skin notes. The palate is very high-toned and pithy with flavors of pear skin, Key lime, chive, sea salt and a touch of smoke, leaving the mouth with quite a sizzle on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",44774
"24923","This is a delicious wine, where the richness of Chardonnay dominates the fresher character of Arinto, resulting in a creamy, full-textured wine with touches of vanilla and ripe yellow fruits. It's well balanced, with the ripe acidity showing well at the end.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",24923
"103121","Deliciously attractive wine, crisp and clean as possible. It has a light caramel edge along with a more fruity aspect. To finish, the wine is light and bright.","Rosé","Rosé","France",103121
"25289","Here's a cheerful and bright Prosecco that delivers enticing aromas of dried hay, field flower, peach and light lemon zest. Tonic, lively bubbling would match fried finger foods.","White","Glera","Italy",25289
"51214","Stewed prune, blue flower, Asian spice and a whiff of oak come together on this. The dense palate offers raisin, blackberry extract, tobacco, vanilla and licorice alongside firm fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017 through 2024.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",51214
"16885","This opens with a gaseous, sulfuric scent followed by aromas of peach pit, apricot, green apple and wet stones. The palate is lean and zesty, while flavors of lemon, tangerine and nectarine finish with a blend of raw acidity and oaky vanilla.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",16885
"60012","A little mealy on the nose, with apple and melon aromas poking through. The palate is both pithy and sharp, with citric acids providing the basis for grapefruit and orange flavors. Pithy on the finish, with passionfruit notes.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",60012
"5288","Castello Banfi delivers a sophisticated and elegant expression with pretty highlights of dark fruit, cassis, crushed spice and even a dusting of black pepper. This classy riserva delivers dark concentration, polished tannins, balanced acidity and long fruit-driven persistency. Best in 5–10 years.","Red","Sangiovese Grosso","Italy",5288
"1385","Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.","White","Pinot Gris","US",1385
"63223","This lacking wine smells vaguely like a scented candle. Jangled and citrusy on the palate, this tastes like flower water. An empty finish with nothing but acidity sends it away.","White","Chardonnay","Argentina",63223
"40024","It's all about flashy, ripe berry jam, red currant and chocolate flavors in this softly tannic wine. Despite the impression of sweetness, the finish is dry, and a little bitter. Hard to tell if it's going anywhere. Give it some decanting and drink now.","Red","Syrah","US",40024
"5676","French oak aging has given this still-young wine a firmly structured character, with dark tannins and a firm texture. It's still very dry, structured and dark and needs a good few years to age and round out. For now, the ripe fruit and acidity are both showing great promise. Drink from 2018.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",5676
"99965","This is cedary and dry smelling, with more spice than fruit aromas. It feels crisp, tight and acidic, with flavors of raspberry, red plum and forced spice coming from the heavy oak. Dry, oaky and spicy on the finish.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",99965
"15403","This is a deliciously fruity wine with tropical fruit tones, a light mineral texture and fine, crisp acidity. From vines planted at 1500 feet above the river, it is fresh, cool and ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",15403
"9376","This is 100% varietal with the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Phinny Hill vineyards. Expressive but still wound-up aromas of exotic spice, French oak, chocolate and dark fruit are followed by pitch-black fruit flavors and tightly wound tannins. It's not yet ready to fully reveal its charms but has the stuffing to go the distance.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",9376
"30936","A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this forward wine opens with aromas that recall scorched earth, blue flowers and baked plum. The evolved, rather rustic palate offers black cherry, cured meat and game alongside fleeting tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",30936
"84738","Harvested in December, this marries opulent flavors of honey and orange marmalade with intense acidity. Ready to drink in its youth, but it's likely to age for many years. Screwcap.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",84738
"1562","This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.","White","Chardonnay","France",1562
"41426","A bit green, with thin flavors of citrus and herbs. Although it's dry and crisp, this Roussanne lacks richness.","White","Roussanne","US",41426
"16236","This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",16236
"26846","This vineyard-designated estate wine is restrained and elegant, allowing for a sparkle of raspberry and black cherry to speak. The oak is light and integrated, and the minerality well defined, with just the smallest traces of black licorice and pepper coming through on the finish.","Red","Zinfandel","US",26846
"83354","d'Arenberg has a quartet of sweet wines from 2008, and this blend of Viognier, Pinot Gris and Marsanne represents a terrific value. It's syrupy sweet, redolent of honey-drizzled, spiced poached pears. To quibble, it could be a touch more complex and crisp, but it is still a succulent mouthful of dessert wine for drinking over the next few years.","White","White Blend","Australia",83354
"96524","Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",96524
"9393","Coming from high terraces above the River Lot, this wood-aged wine is cool, collected and stylish. It has ripe blackberry and currant fruits along with just the right amount of firm tannins. Acidity keeps everything fresh and fruity while guarding the structure. Drink from 2017.","Red","Malbec","France",9393
"88645","Aromas of gooseberry are out in front of kiwi and pineapple. The flavors are fleshy in feel, sweetened by a touch of sugar.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",88645
"9015","A bit leafy and earthy on first take, but this also smells of roasted meat, berry fruit and menthol. It feels layered and rich, with drying tannins and full-force plum and herb flavors. This is big, dark and herbal, finishing with hints of leather, tomato and oregano.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",9015
"105043","Too green and acidic for pleasure, with mint dominating the rather modest cherries and red currants. Sleek and elegant in the mouth, but the absence of richness hurts the score.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",105043
"13469","For an Awatere wine, this isn't overly herbal. Instead, it delivers passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. It's plump, with a slightly creamy midpalate and medium body, making it an easy drink.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",13469
"102241","A very focused wine with a core of strong structure along with apple, tight acidity and citrus. This is powerful, intense, with impressive aging potential.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",102241
"11185","Producer Jean-Yves Bretaudeau enjoys showing how well Muscadet can age. In this cuvée, now five years old, all the signs of freshness are still there, just that they are given an edge of nuttiness as well as spice. The wine is impressive, crisp and also full of character. Drink now.","White","Melon","France",11185
"68178","The shy nose gives away a flinty hint of reduction. The palate has a juicier, easier quality where green pear, slightly earthy yeast and fresh citrus are drawn together. The body is light, fresh and very invigorating. With a little air, more aromas awake and present notions of Conference pear and yeasty saltiness.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",68178
"26536","Matured for 12 months in oak, this wine is full and ripe. It has juicy black currant fruits, plenty of firm tannins to balance and the typical minerality that comes from Douro schist. Drink this impressive wine now.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",26536
"99977","This is hard coated with a creamy plastic note and a milk chocolate scent. Overall it smells heavily oaked and artificial. It feels resiny, with sticky tannins and thickness, tasting of hickory and carob.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",99977
"86499","Saffron and spice pepper fresh lemon and grapefruit aromas on this exceptionally sheer, savory dry Riesling. A haze of citrus flavors fall like gossamer on the palate, extended by layers of dusty minerals on the finish.","White","Riesling","US",86499
"39774","This wine's aromas of baked apple, honey, cinnamon and brown sugar are immediately attractive, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. It's broad and mouthfilling but avoids heaviness, finishing long, with hints of orange rind.","White","Riesling","Germany",39774
"47368","Initial volatile notes blow off to reveal ripe red cherry, sweet sawdust, vanilla and cola notes. With 32 months in French oak, toasty flavors pervade on the light-bodied palate, while underneath all that, luscious cherry transitions to spicy raspberry.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",47368
"84408","Inky red violet to the eye, this wine offers fragrances of blackberry, roast meat and espresso bean. There is a pleasing interplay between acidity and tannins on the palate, backing flavors of ripe cherry, almond blossom, Mediterranean herbs and a drop of salinity. Heading into the sleek finish, the plush texture does not overstay its welcome.","Red","Syrah","Turkey",84408
"55677","Makes a strong statement for the potential of Chardonnay in Chile, with powerful toast and hazelnut aromas playing opposite fruit comprised of peaches and Granny Smith apples. It's barrel-fermented and aged, but stayed only a relatively short time in wood, so you can still taste the fruit and all of the nutty, leesy complexities. Editors' Choice.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",55677
"50334","Smoky, oaky, charred flavors of savory plum and berry lead to a full, layered palate with slightly abrasive tannins. This tastes of grilled beef, lemon peel, toast, cassis and chocolate. A toasted character remains on a solid finish. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo Blend","Spain",50334
"98215","Subdued aromas of underbrush, toast, truffle and ripe black-skinned fruit emerge in the glass. The forward palate offers raisin, dried black cherry, espresso and oak-driven spice alongside dusty tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish. Drink sooner rather than later before the remaining fruit dries up.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",98215
"63808","This blend of 50% Viognier, 19% Chardonnay, 19% Sauvignon Blanc and 12% Pinot Gris offers notes of pear and flowers. It's broad and creamy in feel with stone fruit flavors on the finish.","White","White Blend","US",63808
"100860","The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",100860
"58609","Smoke and musk notes dissipate with aeration to reveal aromas of ripe stone fruit and floral tones. The palate is dry and intensely tart with a piercing lemon-lime acidity. It's a focused, rather linear wine with a steely, mineral finish.","White","Riesling","US",58609
"26420","Aromas of red and black berries, tilled earth, leather and balsamic notes characterize this structured, single-vineyard bottling. The savory palate delivers creamy cherry-berry layered with mint, white pepper, licorice and balsamic herbs supported by firm tannins. Drink 2016–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",26420

"56247","A lavish deep blend of 66% Mourvèdre and 34% Tannat, this is not for the faint of heart or weak in spirit. Pitch black in the glass, it shows espresso, vanilla, caramel and leather touches on the nose. Black cherry and crème de cassis flavors pop on the palate, with strong coffee-like tannins and a creamy vanilla finish. It's still quite young.","Red","Red Blend","US",56247
"459","The aromas are bright, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla, pineapple and lees. The palate is full bodied, with textured and richly flavored tropical fruit notes that lead to a warm vanilla-filled finish. The oak seems a bit heavy handed.","White","Chardonnay","US",459
"97293","A faint but enticing notion of pink grapefruit plays on the nose, and there are floral nuances too. The palate is fruity and fresh and has an appealing, concentrated core of textured citrus zest, followed by a wonderfully clean finish.","White","Riesling","Austria",97293
"63458","This is a smooth customer, with a rich, silky mouthfeel, and has the soft seductive velvety character that allows it to feel complete as a standalone clone. It stops a bit short in the finish, hitting some herbal tannins, but resonates with pretty barrel notes of caramel and a hint of honey.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63458
"11258","This blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan opens with campfire, cassis, chocolate, oak and minty aromas. A wall of acidity greets you on the palate, creating a clampy, rough feel. In terms of flavor, oak is up front and behind that there's graphite and minty, herbal fruit in front of a finish with tobacco, vanilla and length.","Red","Red Blend","Chile",11258
"95019","This finely structured wine with its intense acidity and tight tannins has a cool, high-altitude feel to it. It's a single vineyard wine from Quinta Terra, fresh and with red currant acidity. The wine can be drunk, although the acidity is such that it will be better to wait until the end of 2016 for it soften.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",95019
"36719","An elegant, memorable wine with balance and poise. The nose offers red berry, warming spice and a touch of smoke, while on the palate, smooth, dark berry and spice flavors are harmonious and rich. The wine can age but is good now. Pair with a succulent duck dish or pate and cheeses.","Red","Merlot","Romania",36719
"25595","With crisp acids and a dusting of tannins, this young Pinot could develop additional bottle complexities over the next six years. Right now, it has rich flavors of red currants, cherries, sweet leather, cola and spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",25595
"13165","Damp earth, subtle berry, plum and smoke notes define the nose. It feels typically tannic and clampy for Ribera del Duero, with leathery, roasted flavors of blackberry, rubber and herbs. Long, meaty and dense on the back side, with chewy tannins and sweet lasting flavors.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",13165
"2576","Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",2576
"81874","There's a green mint and gooseberry edge to this 100% Viognier. While it lacks the variety's characteristic opulence, it's elegantly dry and crisp with ripe peach and tropical fruit flavors.","White","Viognier","US",81874
"52596","Copper-pink in color, this Méthode Champenoise Blanc de Noirs from a specific vineyard site offers well-developed flavors of strawberry cream and fennel around a medium tier of acidity. The spicy finish ends well.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","US",52596
"99541","Pretty raspberry fruit scents and flavors dominate, and in the mouth there is a sense of grainy sugars. It has good fruit and ripeness, but still seems a little disjointed. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help sort it out.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",99541
"10867","This is off-dry to sweet, with honey, orange and vanilla flavors with a touch of petrol.","White","Riesling","US",10867
"80169","A full six-years-old, this is a quality example of this extremely cool vintage. A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, the aromas are vibrant but seem ever so slightly dried out, with notes of anise, cassis and blackberry. The red and black-fruit flavors display a fine sense of balance and length that keeps the interest high.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",80169
"12131","Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Argentina",12131
"22189","Grassy aromas along with capsicum, nettle and green fruit aromas are pungent and exciting. The palate is spritzy and lively, while the flavor profile balances sweet, candied green fruit flavors with more driving, intense tastes of lime and green melon. Forward, fun and elevated; drink now for ultimate freshness.","White","Verdejo","Spain",22189
"53257","This solid Merlot begins with savory aromas of cloves, black cherry, and smoke, leading into like flavors in a structured, spirited package. The wine could continue to age, but makes for a good sip now. Pair with smoked meats, roasted duck.","Red","Merlot","South Africa",53257
"95695","This wine is an intriguing blend of three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Syrah (20%) and Grenache. Aromas of café au lait, exotic spice, vanilla, wood notes and black cherries lead to tangy cherry flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins.","Red","Red Blend","US",95695
"19824","Not quite ripe, with a vegetal, herbal edge to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The acidity is nice and brisk, and the texture is beautifully silky, but that tug of greenness distracts, and limits ageability.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",19824
"72568","Juicy and fruity, this is a wine with fine acidity, crisp green fruits and a tight texture. Easy to drink already, it has a tangy character that gives the wine an extra bite at the end.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",72568
"22261","Mining a rich vein of sweet black plum fruits, this is big and powerful while held together with firm tannins, very ripe fruit, a smoky wood character and a ripe, juicy finish. Age for 4–5 years.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",22261
"60070","A whiff of hay and bramble lends an earthy tone to this otherwise bright, easy-drinking wine. On the palate, fresh tangerine, white peach and lemon flavors are refreshing and pristine. Medium bodied and a bit racy, the finish is quite brisk.","White","Chardonnay","US",60070
"88485","Interest-stirring aromas of tea, stewed berry fruits, vanilla and oak segue into a chewy, dense palate with bulk. Savory, lightly herbal berry flavors are draped with oak character, while this Malbec tastes of grainy oak and toast on the finish. Drink through 2021.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",88485
"65997","Open-knit and approachable, this is a warm, velvety wine. Cedar, chocolate and cherry notes glide easily across the palate. Drink now–2020.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",65997
"65387","Classic Gewürztraminer aromas of fresh lychee, pink grapefruit and roses abound on Dr. Frank's lovely bargain Salmon Run. Although full bodied with a plush, broad profile, it's spritzed with a gentle lemon acidity and bitter lime pith and rose potpourri finish. Would pair beautifully with spicy, herbacious Thai dishes, but might be hard to resist savoring on its own.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",65387
"74760","This is a pretty impressive wine being offered for an almost unheard-of price, the fruit sourced largely from Russian River Valley and the Sonoma Coast. Cardamom and cinnamon figure in, with a lightness of body and high-toned strawberry and cherry belying an underlying richness that'll satisfy.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",74760
"18120","Here is a masculine and robust blend of Sangiovese, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot that exhibits thick concentration and aromas of exotic spices, cherry, prune, plum, vanilla and Amaretto. The nose is gorgeous but the mouthfeel is less convincing, with firm tannins.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",18120
"96308","This blend of Tintilla and Listán Negro opens with savory aromas of latex, plum and cherry dusted with minerals. The palate is full but racy. Flavors of plum and cranberry show spice and mineral notes before a long, peppery finish. Overall, this is bright, floral and interesting. Drink now.","Red","Red Blend","Spain",96308
"51986","Made from 65% Sangiovese and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon—organically farmed—this polished red opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, violet and Mediterranean herb. On the full-bodied palate, tobacco and aniseed accent a core of ripe black cherry, while firm tannins provide support.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",51986
"28507","Bright, cheery whiffs of sugar cookie crumbs and Meyer lemon zest perfume this sunny off-dry Riesling. On the palate, sweet-tart tangerine mingles into more savory notes of bees wax and pollen. The finish is brisk but refreshing.","White","Riesling","Germany",28507
"68351","Wet, salinic, oceanic and appley on the nose, with snappy, crisp, almost tart flavors of apple and citrus. A pure wine with juicy acids and a monotone finish that sports lemon and green apple. Powerful, pure, acidic and zesty for Chilean Chardonnay.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",68351
"10984","Owned by the Fourrey family of Domaine Fourrey, the vines come from two parcels in the premier cru. The wine is rich and smooth with good acidity that balances the ripe apple and crisp pear flavors. A strong line of minerality cuts through this still-young wine. Drink from early 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",10984
"43184","Bracing and full-bodied, this offers dried sour cherry, raisin and licorice flavors alongside raspy tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins another few years to unwind then drink up before the remaining fruit disappears.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",43184
"81557","A versatile Merlot. Lends itself to drinking with a range of steaks, poultry, lamb, even vegetarian lentil and tofu dishes. Dry and balanced, with pleasant berry, currant and herb flavors, at a fair price.","Red","Merlot","US",81557
"69887","This is a veritable bargain for the incredible quality it delivers. It's lavishly composed, with a flurry of floral, fruity attributes—cherry blossoms, sweet peaches, and yellow plums—all kissed with honey, and a shower of lemon-lime acidity. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance, but put a few away to see its honeyed tones darken and mature over the next decade.","White","Riesling","Germany",69887
"71432","Hazelnut and lemon can be sensed briefly on the nose. The palate adds bright lemon notes and riper notions of yellow Mirabelle plum, with an overall impression of freshness and stony depth on the midpalate texture. The finish is clean, dry and lasts long, with a pure lemon note.","White","Pinot Blanc","Austria",71432
"22376","This is a very rich wine that's smooth and concentrated. The slopes of Leithaberg on the west shore of Lake Neusiedl have great sun exposure, making this wine full in style. It has minerality as well, giving a steely edge to this impressively ripe wine with its pear and apricot fruits and spice notes.","White","Pinot Blanc","Austria",22376
"38622","Aromas of Bing cherry, herbs, earth and exotic spices tussle a bit on this blend of Sangiovese (55%), Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Merlot and Syrah from Seven Hills and Stillwater Creek vineyards. Flavors are generous yet reserved, with a seamless feel and zippy acids stitching it together, followed by bitters on the finish.","Red","Red Blend","US",38622
"55426","Small production from five acres with biodynamic techniques, the wine is perfumed, full of candied flavors. It has acidity and a zesty texture with a juicy, green plum character. The aftertaste is ripe and full-bodied. Stéphane Derenoncourt consults for owner Pascal Collotte.","White","Bordeaux-style White Blend","France",55426
"76555","This wine is all varietal, coming from one of the state's top sites. Despite the warm vintage and site, it opens with aromas of herbs along with barrel spice and tightly wound dark fruit. The black fruit flavors are fresh and lively, showing elegance and persistence with a tight core of fine grained tannins.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",76555
"78821","A stylistic offering of Pinot Gris with notes of spice, marzipan and lees along with lemony, sharp-edged acids. Not for everyone, but has much to enjoy.","White","Pinot Gris","US",78821
"9820","Juicy, ripe wine, perfumed with sweet fruit. Black berries and bitter chocolate mix with sweet plums and final, lively acidity.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",9820
"67338","This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67338
"50925","Earthy cranberry, black tea and spicy clove deliver a combination of savory and herb, the tannins of the wine soft and subtle. The finish is lean.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",50925
"68248","Saucy plum and raspberry aromas are simple but enjoyable. This feels round but also choppy and tannic. Toasty berry flavors are largely generic, while this tastes spicy and feels resiny on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",68248
"94182","Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through.","Red","Syrah","US",94182
"748","This is smooth and accessible, putting a light chocolate frame around rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's a hint of pepper, and the wine is fresh and youthful, good sipping wine for late summer/early fall.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",748
"45213","Saucy, spicy aromas of wild berry, baked plum and raw oak are forceful and hard-driving. Wide, round, chewy and resiny in feel, this tastes lightly toasted, buttery and woody, but patience reveals deep berry fruit flavors and spice notes. A barrel-heavy finish indicates that this may benefit from another year or two of aging; drink through 2019.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",45213
"60489","This medium weight Chardonnay offered aromas of overripe pineapple and citrus with an odd note somewhere between citrus and varnish. The apple and mild citrus flavors lack vitality, and turn overly tart on the finish.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",60489
"11715","This widely appealing wine has bright acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors. It's a bit sweet in fruity essence, suggesting pairing with southeast Asian fare, arroz con pollo, or even scrambled eggs and bacon.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",11715
"86200","Tastes thick, heavy and sweet in youth, showing the fantastic ripeness of the vintage, with a flavor of cherry and raspberry marmalade. Oak shows up in the rich addition of buttered cinnamon toast. If that sounds good, it is, and you can enjoy it now. But it will improve with 3–4 years in the bottle.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",86200
"83841","This wine's nose is a tad hollow, offering poppy seed, roast beef and black-fruit aromas. The palate conveys blueberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors, with a rising acidity on the finish.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",83841
"21611","The wine, a blend of Antão Vaz, Arinto and Siria, comes from Vidigueira, one of the cooler regions of the Alentejo. That gives the wine its crispness while also allowing it to have a ripe yellow-fruit character. With its spice and final crisp acidity, the wine is ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",21611
"19631","Here's a luminous blend of Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Garganega with mature aromas of pine nut, mature fruit, apricot and yellow rose. The wine is very creamy and smooth in the mouth and has the natural consistency to stand up to fish or pasta. The finish is crisp and slightly sweet.","White","White Blend","Italy",19631
"63707","A sexy nose with soft, pretty plum and cherry fruit leads into a well-rounded, satiny wine that coats the tongue like a velvet glove. The fruit is the star here—ripe strawberries and cherry candy—with a touch of sweetness and a lick of chocolate at the very end.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",63707
"92328","Even nearing the age of four, this wine can't quite overcome its rustic tannins and sharp finish, and never will. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors, it will wash down a nice steak.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",92328
"78118","Prune and raisin aromas pour off the bouquet, providing more than a clue that this wine is on the overripe side. That's confirmed in the mouth, where things feel tannic and over the top; flavors of raisin, sugar beet and chocolate finish with heat and hardness.","Red","Garnacha","Spain",78118
"15267","Leafy, earthy red-berry aromas are backed by a grabby, drying, tannic palate. Lightly herbal black-fruit flavors are followed by dry, rubbery cherry and plum blandness.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",15267
"79292","This Riesling from Piedmont has a fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a hint of honey and beeswax. The palate is nervy and fresh, showing ripe pear, white pepper, clove and honey notes.","White","Riesling","Italy",79292
"11625","Mouthpuckeringly tannic at first, this rustic, leathery Montepulciano grown in the hills above Jamestown has a lot of soul, its Italian roots easy to trace and enjoy. Chuck Hovey makes the well-structured, full-bodied wine, a liquid bowl of ripe plums and raspberries, which could stand a bit of bottle age and a gigantic plate of food.","Red","Montepulciano","US",11625
"47040","The blend includes Grenache and Syrah, suggesting a wine that is part Ribera del Duero, part Priorat. Firm and dark, with black fruits and a strong streak of licorice, with some lighter highlights of blueberry and coffee.","Red","Tempranillo","US",47040
"52339","Medium weight and roundly fruity, this pleasant wine carries a touch of minerality. It's slightly dilute, and there is a suggestion of water cracker resonating through the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",52339
"83108","From one of Barbaresco's most celebrated vineyard crus, this ruby-colored wine exhibits loads of intensity and power in the form of cherry, cassis, leather, tar and cola. The wine's compact, tonic mouthfeel would make a great companion to rich, sophisticated cuisine.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",83108
"18420","Pleasant richness and depth of fruit flavor accompany the deep color and nicely chewy tannins in this full-bodied Cabernet. It tastes dry and well balanced between acidity, tannins and fruitiness, and will be a great mealtime wine with all kinds of protein.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",18420
"42474","A heavily charred opening emphasizes surface-level oak and baking spices more than fruit. A heavy, jabbing, grabby palate tastes herbal, with stewed berry and prune flavors. A burnt-oak flavor and severe tannins are found on the finish of this muscled-up Tempranillo. Drink through 2020.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",42474
"81709","Like all Thomas Fogarty's Chardonnays, this is dry, acidic and minerally. It is not one of those ultrarich Chards dripping with buttered popcorn and tropical fruit jam. Wine aficionados will appreciate the Chablis-like citrus fruit, white flower and steel elegance.","White","Chardonnay","US",81709
"91088","A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",91088
"93451","While the wine has all the steely crispness you expect in a Chablis, it also offers ripe fruitiness that gives a full-bodied, round character. Acidity cuts through to give a lift to the fruit and to the tight texture of this young wine. It should age until 2015.","White","Chardonnay","France",93451
"6228","This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.","Red","Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara","Italy",6228
"15102","A fine effort, with an inviting swirl of earthy components. Citrus, spice, earth, compost, coffee grounds and cinnamon comprise this detailed, aromatic wine. It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs.","Red","Syrah","US",15102
"60109","This fumé starts with aromas of peach, vanilla and spice, followed by an elegant balance of citrus fruit, toasted vanilla and lemon zest. Fresh but with added body, this SB will pair well with oilier, bolder flavored fish, cheese, cream dishes.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","Greece",60109
"83917","Intense aromas of vanilla, smoked nuts and black cherry preserves seduce on the nose of this ripe, richly textured Pinot Noir. It's bold in fruit and oak tones, but penetrating tannins add gravitas to the finish.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",83917
"30191","Fragrant and refined, this has classic Nebbiolo aromas of woodland berry, rose petal, tilled soil and a balsamic note of eucalyptus. It's vibrant, elegant and balanced, boasting juicy cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper and a hint of licorice framed in bright acidity and taut, polished tannins. Drink 2019–2026.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",30191
"93540","A blend of Malvasia, Riesling and Tocai Friulano, the name of the wine means flowers of the grapes. It is a deliciously aromatic wine, spicy, perfumed, with flavors of honey and citrus. Light acidity at the end stops it being too over the top.","White","White Blend","Italy",93540
"27669","This distinctive, complex and layered wine brings a unique aromatic profile of raspberries, sage and spice before fanning out across the palate with gorgeous raspberry syrup, dark chocolate and blackberry flavors. Its lightly grippy texture of fine-grained tannins perfectly counters the plush effusiveness of its fruit.","Red","Zinfandel","US",27669
"60809","A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure. A bit acidic on the palate but staunchly fresh, with good fruit flavor in the red plum category. Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.","Red","Grenache","Spain",60809
"28097","Charred oak, barbecue smoke and a hint of prune detract somewhat in this tart, herbal wine that offers a suggestion of cola. It finishes somewhat flat.","Red","Zinfandel","US",28097
"18985","Elusive raspberry tries to find its way to the fore of this big-bodied Pinot, its time in oak apparent yet integrated. Savory herb notes provide a complexity and balance against the dark cherry fruit, rounding out a wine that has girth but also finesse.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",18985
"73749","This starts off attractively, with a lifted raspberry aroma and just a tiny touch of mint. The red fruit presence expands on the palate, hitting notes of cherry and raspberry and adding hints of spices, like cinnamon and clove. It's full bodied yet supple, with a long, dusty-textured finish that bodes well for aging over the next decade or two.","Red","Rhône-style Red Blend","France",73749
"24096","Clean, simple and correct, this wine offers an excellent window into the Nebbiolo grape. From a young vintage and free of the aromas and textures associated with long aging in wood, this bright wine focuses on quality of fruit and fresh berry aromas backed by crispness and good structure.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",24096
"43444","This Cabernet is a mixed bag. It's oaky and also fruity, but a little vegetal, with some green notes alongside sweet raspberry and cherry candy and caramel flavors. A real disappointment, coming after a series of good bottlings, but the vintage was difficult.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",43444
"56883","Aromas suggest porcini mushroom, espresso and oak. The oak-driven palate offers up roasted coffee bean, vanilla, oak extract, coconut and vanilla alongside astringent wood tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out. The lack of fruit richness gives it a raw quality.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",56883
"75151","Very gamy and umami-rich aromas of bacon fat and animal hide meet with maple, boysenberry, white pepper, rosemary and teriyaki on the nose of this bottling. The savory and somewhat smoky touches thrive on the palate too, where roasted pork and charred plums combine with coffee bean and warm-toast flavors.","Red","Grenache","US",75151
"24063","Here's an unusual white from Sicily made with red Nero d'Avola grapes. It has a subdued floral fragrance and a linear palate showing citrus notes, white pepper and bracing acidity.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",24063
"75776","This tastes and feels mellow and approachable, with gentle aromas of plums, dried herbs and tomato, and medium body with moderate tannins. It is supple and easy to drink.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",75776
"61910","Reflecting the warm 2015 vintage, this is smooth and creamy. It has great fruitiness, recalling yellow fruit cut with a strong citrus streak. It's a wine to drink young, from late 2017.","White","Chardonnay","France",61910
"26762","This big, dense wine is dark in color, with lush, late-picked aromas and flavors and very full body. Its power and oozing fruitiness make quite a contrast with more elegant styles, but there is no denying the appeal of all that jammy blackberry and blackcurrant character.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",26762
"50693","This Pinot Gris is marching to the beat of its own drum, with some funky aromas and toast notes along with lemon and pear fruit. It's a tad volatile in the mouth but has some nice depth of flavor and a lingering cashew finish. Likeable for its originality.","White","Pinot Gris","Australia",50693
"70975","A fragrant nose of chocolate-cherry candy, dried blueberry and hint of spearmint shows on this potent blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot. The body is medium-heavy, with chalky tannins framing the tart boysenberry fruit, grippy leather and tobacco flavors that evolve toward grape and blackberry and finish on a woody cedar note.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",70975
"40923","Lush and generous, this has a center of blackberry fruit, showing barrel accents of sweet baking spices. Notes of graphite and clean earth round out the finish.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",40923
"61620","Some hard scratchiness on the nose announces that this has power and isn't generic. Additional scents of leather, olive and roasted berry are typical for a Maipo Cab. In the mouth, it's on stride and fresh, while flavors of earth, vanilla and carob accent generic berry and cassis.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",61620
"66927","This is a broad, full-bodied Carmenère with leathery, foresty aromas as well as berry and cassis. The palate feels wide, grabby and hefty, while the flavors run toward meaty and toasty, with dark berry, herb and mildly bitter notes. On the finish, it overflows with heat, chocolate and peppery flavors.","Red","Carmenère","Chile",66927
"99986","This smells like citrus and rhubarb more than Malbec, with a tart, herbal palate that's high in acid and short on enjoyability.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",99986
"92615","The wine is tannic and structured, with a dry character that masks the juicy black currant fruits that are there at the back. It shows its wood aging in spice and toast. The wine is ready to drink, although it will always be tannic.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",92615
"91905","This has intense forest-floor aromas, a hint of violet along and toasted oak and vanilla notes. The palate shows bright raspberry and espresso flavors, nervous acidity and firm tannins. It needs time, so drink after 2016.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",91905
"57786","Much in the style of the outstanding 2008, this elegant, Burgundian-like Pinot Noir is a finessed wine, with lovely details of rose petal and penetrating raspberry fruit. There's a pleasing transparency, keeping it light without losing focus or depth, and the finely rendered tannins put the perfect period at the end of the sentence.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",57786
"67323","Earthy, smooth and seductive, this offering from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills has aromas like wet earth, subtle spices and plums. Flavors suggest black-skinned plums and dusky spices, with a relaxed, velvety texture. The acidity is mild for this varietal, while the body is full and the finish lingers.","Red","Barbera","US",67323
"24021","Winemaker Carl Bowker delivers a great-smelling wine on this blend of 64% Tempranillo and 36% Grenache, with aromas of purple fruit, violets and a pepper-crusted bacon. The palate suggests a very flavorful pork roast in plum sauce, showing hoisin, ripe blackberries and grape candy, proving simultaneously playful and elegant.","Red","Red Blend","US",24021
"5819","Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface. The palate has the same citric flavor profile and is diffuse with lots of bubbles—which exaggerates the lightness of the dry palate even more. While there is not a lot of substance there certainly is lots of refreshment.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","France",5819
"23994","The wine is still firmly structured and dark. Tannins dominate what will become attractive red-berry fruits. With the acidity and concentration, this will be a fine wine. Drink from 2018.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",23994
"40405","Not a successful vintage for the winery's Sangiovese. The wine is a bit unripe, with flavors of green vegetable, cherry and white pepper.","Red","Sangiovese","US",40405
"64496","This thick, toasty dessert wine spent more than two years in new French oak. It works. Buttery and rich, it gains significant concentration after blowing past some volatile aromas. Toasted nuts abound, and the silky finish lingers.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",64496
"11714","This wine is one of Galante's better efforts over the years, with fine acidity and a silky texture providing a framework for raspberry and cherry flavors. It's a straightforward, simple wine for drinking right away.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",11714
"44024","Black-fruit aromas are made more complex by notes of leather and oak. This is full, blocky and tannic on the palate, with dark-fruit flavors of black plum and blackberry touched up by oak. A woody but long finish suggests that this will find its prime in a couple of years; drink through 2024.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",44024
"32029","A 100% varietal wine, this features big oak and dry tannins around a rustic core of full-bodied black cherry and dried plum. Savory tobacco and tea provide a sultry edge to the proceedings, before tartness comes to bear on the finish. Enjoy now through 2018.","Red","Sangiovese","US",32029
"62614","Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer presses Syrah and Mourvèdre to make this rosé, hoping that in the process he'll best preserve the wine's aromas and also keep it tasting fresh. He's created a nutty wine that's dominant in strawberry and stone fruit flavors. It's very light and dry, leaving you with the impression of having just bitten into a piece of watermelon.","Rosé","Rosé","US",62614
"43474","Tarry dark-fruit aromas are piercing and slightly herbal. This is a staunch, rock-solid Cab with tannic bite and structural grip. Flavors of black fruits and oak finish spicy, with notes of licorice and woodspice. Freshness combined with ripeness and body weight conveys the wine's depth and overall quality.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",43474
"37681","In terms of aged vintage tawnies, this beautiful wine is relatively young. That means the fruit is still there, hinting at bold red fruits as well as the dried fig and sultana flavors that have also emerged. The wine is finely balanced with its rich texture and poise coming in between dry and sweet. Drink now.","Port","Port","Portugal",37681
"75510","At first stark and steely, this is the earthiest of Bergström's 2009 Pinots, with a streak of beetroot, tightly wound and substantial red fruits, and an earthy base behind well-delineated tannins. Give it time to breathe, and some lovely cinnamon highlights emerge.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",75510
"60074","Fresh and easy, this bright Vermentino would pair well with vegetable egg rolls or easy Spanish tapas. The wine's crisp acidity is followed by peach, citrus and pear flavors.","White","Vermentino","Italy",60074
"88761","Ripe and velvety, this opens with classic varietal scents of crushed violet, black-skinned berry, baking spice and a whiff of leather. The juicy, delicious palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and licorice while firm, refined tannins proved support. It's an impressive effort for this hot vintage.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",88761
"87582","Shows unexpected age, with brown around the edges and mature prune and orange-peel aromas. The flavors are more alive, but are not vibrant. Rather dull on the finish, this isn't bad wine but tastes like something four or five years older.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",87582
"71361","Lake County remains a serious place for Cabernet Sauvignon and Six Sigma is one of its better Cab practitioners. This 2007 version all rich and yeasty baked bread until it delves into black olive, dark plum and black tea flavors, finished by caramel and vanilla, all in all a refreshingly light touch.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",71361
"76819","Best on the nose, where apple and lemony aromas are true. In the mouth, it's foamy and crude, with crushing citrus and cidery flavors. Rough, bubbly and massive; tough stuff to swallow.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Peru",76819
"72436","A lovely wine that, despite its youthful impertinence, shows dramatic flair now and should develop in the short term. It has the weight and structure of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with flavors that veer toward red cherries, sweet leather and pomegranates. All this is kept in tight rein by acidity. This is a balanced wine that wants to assist food.","Red","Syrah","US",72436
"65542","This wine seems barely ripe, with thin, herbal, almost vegetal flavors and a sour streak. The barrel aging may have contributed some suggestions of vanilla and licorice.","Red","Syrah","US",65542
"84774","A little on the soft side, with candied raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, but at this price, it's a decent starter Pinot Noir for those who are curious about this red-hot variety but don't want to spend a bundle. Enjoy the silkiness and spice.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",84774
"93291","This is crystal clear, fleshy and ripe, yet still graceful and refined. Mixed stone fruits are cut with yellow apple, the acids are natural and perfectly integrated. The wine was barrel fermented in a 50/50 mix of new and neutral, and there is just a hint of caramel in the extended finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",93291
"52084","Peachy aromas are less than perky, while in the mouth this is lemony, narrow and citric. Flavors of lemon and tangerine finish with stony mineral notes but also a drawing citric acidity.","White","Albariño","Spain",52084
"29511","Mint and crushed mineral aromas mix with floral scents and barrel resin to form a solid bouquet. The palate is a touch racy and sharp, and thus there's tartness to the cherry and raspberry flavors. Not sour or underdone, but definitely tilts to the red-fruit side of things.","Red","Malbec","Argentina",29511
"78738","Tastes and smells fresh and sweet, like freshly mown hay and nectarines. The overall impression here is one of freshness, really, from its crisp, summery flavors to its zippy mouthfeel. A very nice wine, and a fair price for a taste of a perennial Oz favorite.","White","Riesling","Australia",78738
"80822","This is a thin, light-bodied wine, showy in deep, dark berry and cherry. Around its fruity edges, robust oak and tree bark are softened in black tea.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",80822
"60789","Candied apricots, blossom honey and notions of orange zest take turns in dazzling the nose and palate, while musky botrytis lends a rounded note to the mouthfeel, melding all together into sweet BA harmony. Simply lovely, now or in future years.","White","White Blend","Austria",60789
"11381","Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.","White","Pinot Grigio","Argentina",11381
"19774","Saturated, extracted and heavy, with as many flaws as it has positives. The nose is reduced and saucy, with aromas of roasted tomato, horseradish, prune, tobacco and molasses. The feel leans toward thick, with flavors of chocolate, leather, cassis and blackberry carrying a saucy, herbal underbelly. A decent but disjointed combo of Shiraz (70%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Merlot (5%).","Red","Red Blend","Chile",19774
"54077","Bright and delicious, this sleek, easy-drinking red delivers crunchy strawberry, sour cherry and savory herb. Silky tannins and fresh acidity balance out the juicy palate. Drink through 2016.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",54077
"100761","Rich and floral, this top-notch Pinot Blanc hits the palate with verve and ripe, complex fruit flavors. There's a streak of delicious vanilla under the honeydew and Meyer lemon richness, and the length and power are especially impressive for a Pinot Blanc.","White","Pinot Blanc","US",100761
"8741","Located close to Saint-Tropez, the estate is one of the Côtes de Provence growths classified in 1955. This top wine from the estate is ripe and powerful. It has a structure as well as peach and pear fruit flavors, so it could well age. A citrus burst at the end adds an attractive lift.","Rosé","Rosé","France",8741
"22610","From the up-and-coming Chianti Rufina area (an historic wine zone that is currently experiencing a revival of sorts) comes this plush and modern Riserva. The nose generously delivers aromas of black cherry, powdered chocolate and sweet spice.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",22610
"89032","Tart cranberry/raspberry flavors, found in many of these young Willamette Valley Vineyards Pinots, rule the palate here as well. Relatively high acidity and a restrained barrel regimen keep the oak flavors in check, but the tannins carry more than enough weight and grip for overall balance.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",89032
"48912","This barrel selection has long been Signorello's best Chardonnay, and it still is. It elevates Napa Valley, not the most natural home to Chardonnay, to its finest expression. Earthy but complex, it has intricate citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, as well as a firm minerality. Drink now.","White","Chardonnay","US",48912
"42824","Heavy and sweet, with apricot jam, tangerine, buttercream and caramel flavors. A sound everyday Chardonnay for drinking now. Production was 10,000 cases.","White","Chardonnay","US",42824
"27836","Vigna La Rosa is always among Fontanafredda's best performing wines and this vintage will appeal to those who enjoy a riper, fuller style of Barolo. There are mature aromas of blackberry and raspberry backed by meaty tones of mesquite, smoke, cola, charcoal and powdery mocha. There's density and roundness here with velvety, plush tannins.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",27836
"59588","This Chardonnay's acidity and minerally structure are finely balanced, and its palate already shows richness. Full, fruity and textured, the wine's touch of toast creeps into notice. This is worth aging for 2–3 years.","White","Chardonnay","France",59588
"72957","Tingling lemon and grapefruit pith make for a tantalizing experience in this white made from several vineyard sources throughout the Napa Valley. Saline and wet stone provide the minerality, with a searing seasoning of lemongrass. The wine finishes on a tart, herbal note that yearns to be matched with seafood.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",72957
"54550","Gentle hints of smoke and pine wood hover on the nose. The palate has the same spicy glint of pine and some oaky smoky spice. The fruit underneath is lovely and pure: tart cranberry and raspberry are expressed beautifully. The body is soft and fresh, undeniably supported by lots of oak but it manages to achieve an elegant poised balance. It is on the finish that vanilla makes another appearance.","Red","Pinot Noir","Austria",54550
"97764","Savory herbs and peppery watercress dominate the crunchy green pear fruit on nose and palate. Citrus edges lend liveliness to the concentrated, spicy palate. Lots going on here, from the first whiff to the last, lingering echo.","White","Grüner Veltliner","Austria",97764
"98183","In Beaujolais, 2010 was a firm and structured year, and this is very evident in this darkly tannic wine. It is packed with juicy acidity and red berry fruits, while it is also in need of several months' aging.","Red","Gamay","France",98183
"37890","Light, clear and aromatically reminiscent of pine, this smooth, soft wine offers spicy acidity around integrated tannins and oak, finishing with a length of cinnamon.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",37890
"2717","Fazio makes the best of hot climate growing conditions and presents a well-composed Nero d'Avola that is enhanced by aromas of red apple, cassis, pomegranate and black cherry. There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick.","Red","Nero d'Avola","Italy",2717
"10492","Profoundly mineral tones of earth and dust mingle with lychee and rose petal throughout this dry, light-bodied, yet brooding Gewürztraminer. The palate is marked with classic varietal notes of potpourri, stone fruit and spice, but they're uniquely exaggerated, with a deeply phenolic, bitter overtone that builds. Overall, it presents a fascinating play between the classic and unique.","White","Gewürztraminer","US",10492
"90286","A fine expression of mineral Sauvignon Blanc, very textured with green herb and fruit skins giving a tense shape to a wine that could age. It's finely balanced, the refreshing acidity cutting right through the wine.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","France",90286
"84303","The nose is a tad dusty, with hints of unripe fruit and leaves, but the palate on this brut sparkling is clean and lemony, with a sharp, steely profile. Aggressive on the attack, with a stark, brisk acidity, it finishes with abundantly mouth-filling froth.","Sparkling","Sparkling Blend","Ukraine",84303
"68936","This is a fruity but also structured blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional. It's full of red fruit, dusty tannins with a dry core and balancing acidity. Drink until 2020.","Red","Portuguese Red","Portugal",68936
"53400","A rich, earthy Pinot bright in red and blue fruit and an herbal note in the distance, Londer's estate-grown Pinot is a marriage of site, style and vintage. Lightly textured with soft edges and complexity to spare, it should pair well with bacon and goat cheese quiche.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",53400
"20938","Hard berry and plum aromas turn minty and grassy with airing. It feels tough and tannic, but fresh, with mild herb-tinged flavors of red berry and red plum. Finishes lively but rough, with a mint note and grabby tannins.","Red","Tempranillo","Spain",20938
"52743","Another delicious Mourvèdre from Fenestra's estate that's invitingly earthy, spilling over with dark plum and sweet blackberry aromas and a taste of spicy cardamom. Very bright and light in taste, the wine's body has enough heft to pair with big-boned meals and a lot of spiciness. Drink now.","Red","Mourvèdre","US",52743
"98767","This selection from a 40-year-old vineyard manages to convey both power and complexity in a transparent, nearly ephemeral style. Like gazing into a clear pool of deep water, you plunge through a surface patina of ripe, crushed raspberries into a textural, evanescent palate framed in dark chocolate. Drink now through 2030 and beyond.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",98767
"26792","This extroverted wine brims with toasted oak, chocolate and smoke aromas, followed by ripe, jammy fruit flavors. With full body and a velvety texture of soft tannins, it's both smooth and tongue-gripping at the same time.","Red","Primitivo","US",26792
"45706","This mountain Nebbiolo opens with aromas of forest floor, violet, menthol and a whiff of scorched earth. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper and star anise alongside austere tannins that grip the finish.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",45706
"92519","This blend of Petit Verdot (40%), Grenache (29%), Shiraz (29%) and Mataro (2%) ends up being a pleasing recipe at an even more pleasing price. Mulberry, plum and vanilla flavors emerge from the glass, while the mouthfeel is full and lush. Probably best over the next year or so.","Red","Red Blend","Australia",92519
"13458","Philadelphia-born Daniel Brennan has crafted this medium-bodied wine from a vineyard in the Crownthorpe subregion. Despite its modest alcohol level, it tastes ripe, offering attractive hints of snow pea, fig and nectarine before falling away a bit rapidly on the finish.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","New Zealand",13458
"86740","Vibrant red plum and cherry aromas meet hibiscus, cinnamon and a touch of inviting cotton candy on the nose of this bottling. The palate brims with cinnamon spice, baked strawberry and red plum, further enhanced by licorice and ginger snap flavors. The structure is elegantly grippy.","Red","Nebbiolo","US",86740
"67423","Well balanced and moderately flavorful, this wine feels quenching and appetizing at the same time but needs time to round off its rough edges. It's not overwhelmingly fruity or oaky, but has compact, concentrated red cherry and rhubarb and a good firm grip of tannin and fruit acidity. It will be best after 2019.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",67423
"87639","This is a domaine wine, coming from one of the vineyards owned by Olivier Leflaive and worked biodynamically. It is a very fine wine from probably the most well-known premier cru in the village. With its rich acidity and white fruits, it is generous as well as crisply textured. The toast from the wood aging adds its juicy character to this impressive wine. Drink from 2019.","White","Chardonnay","France",87639
"72012","Subdued aromas recall dried woodland berry, mint and a whiff of culinary spice. The juicy, straightforward palate offers raspberry, ripe cherry, clove and a touch of star anise alongside solid but well integrated tannins. Drink through 2019.","Red","Nebbiolo","Italy",72012
"99876","Crisp apple and lemon are lurking within creamy wallops of oak, making this a pleasant-enough wine. The ripeness and butter make for curious companions given the bitterly tart, sour finish.","White","Chardonnay","US",99876
"90571","Ripe and tangy, this full-flavored wine may miss out on some fruitiness but it has plenty of other flavors with herbs, spice and pepper. The blend holds 50% Mouvèdre, 25% Tibouren, 15% Grenache and 10% Syrah selected from old-vine plots. It could wait a few months, so drink from the end of 2015.","Rosé","Rosé","France",90571
"69632","Medium-bodied and well-priced for the quality, this Merlot is herbal in cassis and red cherry flavors, on the elegant side of the spectrum, and relatively low in alcohol. The tannins are firm and mellowed, the finish just fine.","Red","Merlot","US",69632
"92906","This off-dry Riesling offers plenty of concentrated apple juice flavors accented by a dash of lemon and savory apple pie spice. There's a hint of petrol throughout that adds a layer of depth, but overall, it's simple and easy drinking.","White","Riesling","US",92906
"82524","The inaugural vintage of this 100% varietal wine, this was given two years in French oak, half of it new. It's wide in approach, showing full-bodied richness and concentration, its flavors trafficking in bacon, juicy cherry and vanilla.","Red","Cabernet Franc","US",82524
"70685","Here's a look at an older vintage of Casalferro (Sangiovese and Merlot) that showcases the aging potential of this super Tuscan blend. Ripe fruit and spice is backed by ethereal tones of cola, licorice, herbs and resin. The mouthfeel is characterized by dusty tannins and a crisp close.","Red","Red Blend","Italy",70685
"99882","Melony aromas come with a heavy blast of brine. This feels oily and marginal, with salty, briny flavors of orange and lime that finish disjointed before falling off.","White","Chardonnay","Chile",99882
"319","Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.","Red","Merlot","Chile",319
"56917","This light and fruity wine has fresh acidity as well as lemon and ripe pear fruits. It is soft, smooth, and with a creamy texture, is very ready to drink.","White","Portuguese White","Portugal",56917
"88841","Confident, smoky aromas of black fruits, quality oak and minerality set up a round, dense, smooth palate that's as elegant as things get in Chile. True Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are spicy, lightly herbal and suggest licorice, cassis and blackberry. On the finish, warm oak, menthol and medicinal flavors call for another few years in bottle. Best from 2016–2023.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","Chile",88841
"14769","A beautiful young Pinot Noir, gorgeously structured in acids and tannins, and intricately layered. Assaults the palate with grilled raspberries and cherries, with notes of mocha, anise and pepper. Just lovely with a great steak.","Red","Pinot Noir","US",14769
"6859","A dusty, brambly Zinfandel nuanced in blueberries and plums, this is smooth and soft on the palate with an earthy quality throughout. On the finish this medium-bodied wine offers leathery tobacco and smoke.","Red","Zinfandel","US",6859
"101951","Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.","Red","Cabernet Sauvignon","US",101951
"28737","This Petit Verdot grown on the hillsides of El Dorado County in California Gold Country is all dark berry and strawberry jam, still tight and grippy with room to develop added complexity over time.","Red","Petit Verdot","US",28737
"39373","Saldo comes from the folks who brought you The Prisoner. Admirable ripeness and lushness carry this full-bodied, dark-colored and densely fruity wine from a smoky aroma through jammy dark-fruit flavors to a lingering finish that has a drop of baking-spice sweetness.","Red","Zinfandel","US",39373
"62174","Floral and exotic, the tingling acidity in this wine is the standout, but it's equally buoyed by a mouth-filling texture adorned by a sensation of fresh-squeezed lime and grapefruit. Balanced, this lovely Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc should convince one and all of the variety's regional merit.","White","Sauvignon Blanc","US",62174
"8469","With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","US",8469
"62430","There's a respectably complex nose on this pink wine, with lemonade and pressed plums blending into a wet cement minerality. The palate is very tasty, with flavors of pomegranate, dried rose petals, hibiscus, night jasmine and even a clove-laced mocha element proving quite intriguing.","Rosé","Rosé","US",62430
"105560","The palest pink suggests the almost-weightless lightness of this refreshing wine. It would be an ideal, zippy and very slender apéritif. Drink soon.","Rosé","Rosé","Austria",105560
"80411","This is not an obvious wine, but one that creeps up slowly, takes time and impresses quietly. It delivers depth rather than power. Glints of pepper and allspice shine amid the restrained red, tart cherry fruit. The slightest of tannic grips stems from concentration rather than extraction. It's elegant Alsace Pinot, quiet but firm.","Red","Red Blend","France",80411
"83873","Freshly cut Anjou pear, crisp apple, hints of honeydew and lime skin show on the nose of this vibrant bottling by Greg Brewer. There is bouncy acidity and a fine-grained, chalky grip to the sip, delivering chilled green-melon and lime-sorbet flavors. It's tangy yet laced with stony minerality and intriguing texture.","White","Chardonnay","US",83873
"73809","Though the oak is high quality (62% new American and French), it's in your face on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of char and toast. It's soft, silky and elegant in feel but the barrel flavors take over making it hard to get all the fruit notes.","Red","Merlot","US",73809
"40284","This offers black currant flavors and firm, stalky tannins. It has acidity, a good juicy character and a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2015.","Red","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","France",40284
"46012","Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with purple flower and forest floor aromas. The firm palate delivers black cherry, clove and a hint of leather alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2019.","Red","Sangiovese","Italy",46012
